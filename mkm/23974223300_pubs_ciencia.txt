    "bio": "Susana Brás was born in Chaves, Portugal in 1983. She is a researcher at Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro (IEETA), University of Aveiro, Portugal. Her research interests are focused on ECG biometric identification, emotional modulated environments and information extraction from large biomedical databases. At this research unit, she supervised several master students, and a PhD student. She published several papers in top journals and conferences in the Affective Computing area, which gave to her visibility in the scientific community, allowing the invitation to deliver several invited talks, internally and externally to the Aveiro University. She collaborates in the writing and submission of several proposals to national and international funds, some of those projects financed and in execution, others already finished with good evaluations. Before, she was a PhD student at Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute, at University of Porto, Portugal. Her thesis was focused on automation in anesthesia, basically the drug distribution and effect were studied and modeled as well as the depth of anesthesia level, measured by alterations in the brain electrical activity. At the end a closed loop control for the hypnotic effect and an anesthesia simulation software were presented. Her background is in Applied Mathematics, from the Sciences Faculty, at University of Porto. Before joining the research activity, she worked as actuary (pension funds analyst and technician) at a private Bank in Portugal. During this activity she was responsible for the management of the company website, public and private access. Also, she was responsible for several commercial and technical tasks.  ",
