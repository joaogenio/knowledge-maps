        "doc_abstract": "© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The sustainable growth of cities created the need for better informed decisions based on information and communication technologies to sense the city and quantify its pulse. An important part of this concept of “smart cities” is the characterization of vehicular traffic flows and the prediction of urban mobility. Although there are several sensors that are able to infer the traffic flows in the city, road-mounted traffic counters can measure the number of vehicles in different parts of the roads. However, they are not usually used in traffic city prediction; therefore, we can provide a first step for the usefulness of these sensors in the city management. In this paper we study both statistical and deep learning methods to describe, understand and predict the city traffic profile. Although traffic presents seasonal patterns, in occasional situations these may not be verified. Considering the proposed approaches, statistical algorithms, such as SARIMA, and neural network algorithms, such as FFNN, LSTM, CNN and hybrid LSTM-CNN, we found that statistical models are significantly good to predict the traffic counters data in the short-term, even when anomalous traffic conditions are observed. For long-term predictions, CNNs have shown to be efficient and robust. Long-term and short-term forecasting, in the context of traffic flow prediction, may be a strategy to accomplish different goals. Long-term forecasting can be chosen for traffic flow description, and short-term forecasting can be used to identify and mitigate anomalies.",

Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro Aveiro 3810-193 Portugal The sustainable growth of cities created the need for better informed decisions based on information and communication technologies to sense the city and quantify its pulse. An important part of this concept of “smart cities” is the characterization of vehicular traffic flows and the prediction of urban mobility. Although there are several sensors that are able to infer the traffic flows in the city, road-mounted traffic counters can measure the number of vehicles in different parts of the roads. However, they are not usually used in traffic city prediction; therefore, we can provide a first step for the usefulness of these sensors in the city management. In this paper we study both statistical and deep learning methods to describe, understand and predict the city traffic profile. Although traffic presents seasonal patterns, in occasional situations these may not be verified. Considering the proposed approaches, statistical algorithms, such as SARIMA, and neural network algorithms, such as FFNN, LSTM, CNN and hybrid LSTM-CNN, we found that statistical models are significantly good to predict the traffic counters data in the short-term, even when anomalous traffic conditions are observed. For long-term predictions, CNNs have shown to be efficient and robust. Long-term and short-term forecasting, in the context of traffic flow prediction, may be a strategy to accomplish different goals. Long-term forecasting can be chosen for traffic flow description, and short-term forecasting can be used to identify and mitigate anomalies. Graphical abstract Keywords Smart urban mobility Traffic flow Forecasting Deep learning 1 Introduction Smart cities use information and communication technologies to enhance decision making and contribute to a more sustainable use of resources. The s m a r t aspect refers to the ability to integrate sensing and analytic capabilities to support data-informed decision and actuation [1]: for example, adaptive management of electricity consumption, by turning the lights on only when there are people nearby [2]; smart irrigation by preventing irrigation when there is sufficient water in the soil or when it is likely to rain in the following days [3]; reduction of traffic jams by optimizing the traffic lights [4], etc. The sensing and communication capabilities, deployed across the city, enable data collection and transmission to support analytic processes, from which adaptive actuation may occur. In this context, cities offer a rich domain to apply Internet of Things (IoT) architectures [5]. The smart management of urban mobility is one of the goals that benefit from the smart city concept. Using IoT platforms, it is possible both to collect and analyze urban mobility data, and to plan and assess actions to improve it. Application use cases include on-demand parking, responding to accidents in real-time, improving traffic flow, etc. Understanding urban dynamics is essential to combat road traffic problems, since it aims to understand and assess the current mobility of the city in the different roads, the trends, and the anomalies. With the understanding of mobility, the next step is the prediction of the current trends, and even the anomalies’ prediction, to enable a good traffic management, for example, through the change of several lanes or the optimal routing of people through the roads, or to enable a fast reaction to sudden mobility problems, for example, problems caused by events or accidents in the roads. This work is focused on the study of smart urban mobility in Oporto, Portugal, leveraging on the existing sensing capabilities to collect historical traffic sensing data through traffic counters. Porto LivingLab [6] is a Smart City initiative that aims to study urban dynamics. This project deploys a multi-source sensing infrastructure, capturing information from a vehicular network, weather sensors, environment sensors, people-flows’ sensors, and traffic counters. The data will be used to train prediction models for traffic flows in order to assess the predicted value of traffic counters, including the mobility anomalies. The goal of our study is to enable the creation of services to help city managers of Oporto to take preventive actions before bigger problems occur. More specifically, this work studies urban mobility by using historical data from road-mounted traffic counters to predict future vehicular traffic behavior. For this approach, we explore both statistical and Deep Learning (DL) methods, looking for suitable alternatives for short and medium-term forecasting. Traffic flows present daily and weekly patterns that are considered for the development of the forecasting models. Due to the seasonal component of the traffic flow, the first proposed approach is based on the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model; however, since some relations cannot be modeled or perceived in a deterministic way, artificial neural network algorithms were also proposed for this prediction approach: FeedForward Neural Network (FFNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a hybrid LSTM-CNN. These approaches are used in the data of traffic counters. This type of data is not normally used in the traffic city prediction, which provides a first step for the usefulness of these sensors in the city management. Moreover, we found that statistical models are significantly good to predict the traffic counters data in the short-term. For long-term predictions, CNNs proved to be efficient and robust. Considering the results of the performance tests, two major goals may be achieved by the use of the proposed methods: long-term forecasting for traffic flow description, and short-term forecasting for anomalies identification and mitigation. Existing solutions on forecasting traffic flow are usually not concerned with predicting traffic when anomalous traffic conditions happen. The solutions that include short-term methods, in addition to the long-term methods, are more focused on an accurate prediction of normal traffic flow. We aim to show, with our work, the benefits that different models can have when used together. Although the several forecasting approaches have already been tested in the literature with mobility data, more specifically the location of sets of vehicles over time, the use of traffic counters has not been researched for future predictions. This is the main reason for this paper: to assess how the forecasting approaches perform to predict the number of vehicles through the use of traffic counters in the road traffic management. Moreover, we also take important conclusions on the usefulness of statistical methods and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), both for short- and long-term forecasting, mainly in the event of anomalies in the traffic. As we conclude in the end, a hybrid method composed by statistical and neural network approaches seems to be the most appropriate. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: • Creation of a Fiware 1 1 structure to receive and persist traffic counters data, to make it available for open access in the future; • Development of pipelines for preprocessing the data; • Seasonality and quality assessment of the time-series produced by traffic counters; • Development of a short-term forecasting model (one-hour span), based on statistical methods, and a long-term forecasting model (one-week span) based on DL; • Computational pipeline to integrate production infrastructure and the new forecasting capabilities; • Research approaches for traffic predictions in presence of anomalies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work to forecast urban mobility data. Section 3 presents the Oporto LivingLab and the selected use cases, and Section 4 describes the process to forecast the traffic flow. Section 5 addresses the forecasting with statistical-based approaches and neural networks, and Section 6 addresses the anomaly detection and traffic prediction upon anomalies. Finally, the last section discusses the main conclusions and proposes future improvements. 2 Related work Traffic counters provide quantitative evidence of the evolution of traffic flows along time. The analysis of traffic behavior can forecast potential problems, and help with the development of alternative solutions. Several approaches have been proposed to address the forecasting of traffic flows, ranging from historical methods to machine learning applications [7]. The urban mobility data used in this work contains spatial and temporal information. Each node, individually (each traffic flow sensor), can be represented through a time-series. The following methods are suited for time-series data. 2.1 Historical and statistical methods The work in [8] used Historical Average Forecast (HAF), SARIMA, Exponentially Weighted Historical Average (EWHA), and Deviation from Historical Average (DHA) to forecast the vehicular traffic flow. The best results were obtained with SARIMA; however, they made one step SARIMA predictions. The work in [9] used Kalman filtering theory to predict traffic volume, with minimal computational resources. The work in [10] used SARIMA and Facebook PROPHET (FbPROPHET) to perform short-term traffic forecasting. It collected hourly traffic volume count data for seven days. This work concluded that SARIMA was the best model to perform forecasting, and the FbPROPHET model obtains good results in forecasting the trend and the boundaries. In [11], the authors used SARIMA to predict the crowd in an emergency department of a hospital using hourly historical data from the hospital and hourly traffic data from nearby roads. They developed two models, one that uses only the information from the hospital and another one that uses both. For the traffic data, they chose the three roads with the highest cross-correlation with the information from the hospital. The predictions were improved when using traffic data. SARIMA models are deterministic and computationally lightweight; however, they are very limited in the prediction they can make, since they can only predict a short period of time. The works in [8,10,11] achieved good results using SARIMA to forecast traffic related data. For this reason, a SARIMA model will be developed in this work for short-term forecasting. 2.2 Artificial neural networks Machine Learning comprises several areas of study, including DL [12]. DL models are inspired by the biological nervous systems and are based on ANN [12]. An ANN can be composed of several layers of neurons, whose information flows through the layers. ANNs are algorithms that find dependencies and relations between attributes, not available in a first analysis. Note that, given the absence of a clear description of urban traffic, the relation between variables is not defined or known. Usually, an ANN is formed by three types of layers: the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. Each layer can have one or more neurons [13]. The data can be propagated by several layers. At the end of each step of the training process, it will be made a prediction that will be compared with the actual value using a loss function, that increases as the difference between the true value and the predicted value increases. The score optimizers, such as r m s p r o p and a d a m [13] [12], are responsible to make the required corrections. It is important that the dataset passes several times through the network, to avoid underfitting. We can also have overfitting of the data. Overfitting happens when the model can perfectly describe the data. It may sound good, but it is not. The problem with overfitting is that the model is not generalized. Sometimes it is necessary to make the dropout of some neurons, where some connections are “turned-off” to ensure that there is no overfitting of the model [13,14]. Dropout is used when we have fully connected layers, as is the case with FFNN and LSTM. Since CNNs have fewer connections, they are less predisposed to overfitting; therefore, dropout is not essential in CNNs architectures. Activation functions should be non-linear, because they allow non-linear transformation to the data, but this does not mean that they have to be complex [13]. Some common activation functions used are Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh) and softmax. In some cases, linear activation functions can be used. In [15] the authors developed a FFNN to forecast passenger flows on Metro lines. The authors have chosen to develop a FFNN because the relationships between inputs and outputs were not known, and they could obtain fast results. The work in [16] developed a traffic flow prediction model through Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which takes into account the spatial–temporal characteristics of the data. In the beginning, the data goes through an attention model that will determine how correlated the past data is with future data. The model uses a CNN for the spatial component, and uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the temporal component. At the end, the model uses a regression method to link both networks. The model in [17] uses a five-layer Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, which is a type of RNN with a gating mechanism to make a short-term traffic flow prediction. Due to the bad results obtained when compared with CNN, the authors performed a spatio-temporal feature selection using a Spatio-Temporal Feature Selection Algorithm (STFSA) before applying the GRU model. The work in [18] investigated the influence of the use of short and long term patterns to get a more accurate prediction, and developed a Dynamic Temporal Context Neural Network (DTC) framework. The DTC model uses short and long term patterns as features, and determines the most relevant ones through online learning. Online learning has some issues associated: as time goes by, some long term patterns can be lost. However, this model can dynamically determine the most relevant patterns for the regression GRU model used. One major limitation of this work is that it does not include spatial dependencies, only one geographic point was analyzed. The work in [19] proposed a LSTM neural network to capture nonlinear traffic dynamics to make short-term traffic prediction. This type of network can determine the optimal time lags, which can improve performance. Longer time lags lead to better performance. Some recent works proposed approaches based on CNNs [20–22] for traffic and flow forecasting, that have in consideration the spatio-temporal dependencies. In [20] it is proposed a spatio-temporal residual network to deal with the node flow (inflow and outflow). The model has in consideration external factors, such as the weather and the day of the week. In [21], the authors proposed a Multi-task Deep Learning (MDL) framework to predict the node and edge (transitions) flows, since they mutually influence each other. They used as external factors holidays, weather conditions, temperature and wind speed. The proposed method can capture spatial and temporal correlations and external factors. In [22] it is proposed a spatio-temporal dynamic network with a gating mechanism to deal with spatial dependencies, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism to deal with temporal dependencies. There are also some proposed approaches based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) [23–26]. In [23] the authors proposed a graph WaveNet that deals with spatial–temporal dependencies. In [24] the authors proposed a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network. They used convolutional and recurrent units over graphs. The authors could predict short and long term forecasting. In [25] it is proposed a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network. Besides diffusion convolution, it is used sequence-to-sequence learning. In [26] it is proposed a MDL model to deal with node and edge flow. It is adopted graph convolution to process graph-structured data and to also deal with grid based data. This approach was able to predict short and long term forecasting. 2.3 Discussion From the models presented above, the statistical models are more transparent and reproducible. ANNs are seen as ’black boxes’. In some cases, statistical models can obtain similar results to ANNs. One of the advantages of using ANNs is because they can handle multi-dimensional data and are very adaptable, as well as handling outliers, missing data or noisy data [27]. The statistical methods might be more appropriate to detect patterns related with time. To efficiently develop ANN, some principles should be considered. First, it is important to find the weights of the inputs. The training process will update the model weights in each iteration; however, the optimization algorithm used may not lead to the minimum error or loss, and can lead to overfitting. Since ANNs require large amount of information and computational power, in the presence of a complex model, the training process can last for days or even months. This will be one of the aspects to assess in the models: its training and testing time. Since the traffic counter is not able to provide graph-based data, we will consider the main approaches for ANNs, but GCNs are not able to be applied to this type of data. Although these approaches have already been tested in the literature with mobility data, more specifically the location of sets of vehicles over time, the use of traffic counters has not been researched for future predictions. This is, therefore, the aim of this paper: to assess the use of traffic counters in the road traffic management. 3 Use cases The forecasting methods developed in this work are based on the use cases and data sensing infrastructure provided by Porto LivingLab. Porto Digital 2 2 provided the required access to traffic flow sensors data that feed the developed platform. Fig. 1 contains one of the sensors deployed by Porto Digital. The cuts located in Fig. 1(a), highlighted in Fig. 1(b), were made to deploy the sensor. The red area is the area where the counts of vehicles are made. 3.1 Oporto living lab infrastructure Porto Living Lab project has a common backend infrastructure to ensure consistency in the data models used. They use a Fiware infrastructure to manage data, and they have services that perform data analysis, filtering, and preprocessing. Data sharing is achieved by using different services like publish–subscribe middleware, RESTful API, etc [6]. This project has three monitoring platforms (people sensing, environmental sensing, and vehicular network sensing), provides free Wi-Fi service to public bus users, and allows the development of several research works. The vehicular network helps in the increase of the wireless coverage area [6]. 3.2 Selected use cases Managing urban mobility is a demanding responsibility of city managers. Sometimes, they can only identify problematic areas when the issues reach significant proportions. Predicting traffic problems before they happen, or at early stages, is one of the main goals. Since urban mobility data is complex, city managers would benefit from a computational system that is able to find patterns in traffic and predict traffic conditions. Forecasting traffic flow can be useful to determine, for example, the impact that construction can make in a zone. Detecting anomalies in traffic can be useful to generate alarms. For example, drivers may be obligated to change their routes because something unexpected happened, like a fallen tree. In this case, the presence of authorities may be required. This can be partially achieved by using the data from the traffic flow sensors, which provide the count of vehicles at a specific location. The main use cases for the data from Oporto to be addressed in this work are: • Analyze patterns in the traffic flow, • Forecast traffic flow, • Detect anomalies in traffic flow, • Forecast traffic flow even in anomalous situations. 4 Methods for traffic flow forecasting This section describes the process of forecasting the traffic flow in Oporto. 4.1 Approach and methods In order to study traffic counters, we first choose one single traffic counter. The sensing data presents several problems, those can be solved by performing data cleaning, like smoothing. After the preprocessing step, we can analyze the data. The data exhibits important characteristics: periodic counting data with time-series specificities. Due to the seasonal component of the traffic flow, we decided to use SARIMA model on data. Nevertheless, some relations cannot be modeled or perceived in a deterministic way. Therefore, artificial neural network algorithms were also considered: FFNN, LSTM, CNN and a hybrid LSTM-CNN. We decided to create a FFNN, since they can resemble any continuous function and can perform non-parametric regression [28]. RNNs are designed to deal with sequential data; however, they face the vanishing error problem that prevents them from learning more than 10 time steps. LSTM is a type of a RNN that can deal with long short-term forecasting, and it is not affected by the vanishing error problem. Since we are dealing with time series, and therefore we have sequential data, LSTM seems to be a good model to perform forecasting [29]. Although CNNs were initially mainly used in image classification, recent works prove that CNNs can be suitable for time series forecasting [16,20–22]. The major difference between CNNs and LSTMs is that CNNs learn by batch, while LSTMs learn by sequence. Because of this, CNNs can perform parallelization while LSTMs cannot. This means that CNNs are usually faster, and because they require low memory, they are computationally lighter. Another advantage of CNNs is that they can handle missing data [30,31]. GCNs are not a good fit for our problem because we only predict one traffic counter at a time. Even if we included several traffic counters, we only have information about the number of vehicles that the sensor measured in the interval, so we have only the transitions. We do not have the inflow and outflow, i.e., we do not know the exchanges between the different sensors, and these cannot be calculated because the road infrastructure is very complex and the sensors are sparse for the network density. Therefore, GCNs are not considered in our approach. After the traffic flow prediction, we will study the impact that anomalies can have on the data, and verify if the models can still perform accurate predictions. 4.2 Dataset selection The traffic flow data will be used to make predictions of the future values. The infrastructure data will give support to the previous task. We choose five weeks to study the traffic flow, from September 30 of 2019 to November 3 of 2019. The first four weeks are used to study the data, and to train and test the forecasting modules. The last week is only used to observe anomalies, study them, and try to predict them, since November 1st is a holiday in Portugal. The traffic flow dataset contains some outliers and imprecise Global Position System (GPS) sensors. In some of the cases, we had several possible streets for the location of the sensors. Besides that, we did not know the direction where the sensors were placed. Table 1 includes some descriptive statistics, after the outliers have been removed. With respect to traffic flows, Fig. 2 presents the data of 2 sensors, CT3Z3 and CT4Z3. CT3Z3 sensor presents some outliers, the six peaks in the graphic, that can be discarded. The sensor in node CT4Z3 has abnormal values, and therefore, will not be used in the data analysis. 4.3 Preparatory traffic flow data analysis The traffic flow is a specific type of data, denoted as count data. We selected a specific traffic flow sensor to focus the study in one time-series. That sensor has an identification of CT1Z8. As can be observed in Fig. 3, the traffic flow presents high variability, which may hide existing patterns in the data. The figure represents the first week of data, and the vertical red lines symbolize the different days. We can observe patterns between days and seasonality. Nevertheless, the excessive variability may be hiding patterns and makes difficult to model the behavior of the traffic flow. A preprocessing step was added to the process to smooth the data, allowing a better interpretation of the data patterns. In order to apply smoothing methods appropriately, the time-series should be stationary. We can verify stationarity by performing a statistic test, the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. The ADF test is a unit root test that tests how strong a time-series can be characterized by a trend. If the time-series is non-stationary, it is necessary to apply differentiation to make it stationary [32]. This test has a null hypothesis that assumes that the time-series can be represented by a unit root. So, a null hypothesis is defined considering that the time-series is non-stationary. Therefore, if the null hypothesis is rejected, it can be concluded that the time-series is stationary. The hypothesis test is verified by the calculated p -value. If the p -value is lower than a threshold, then the null hypothesis is rejected, meaning that the time-series is stationary [32]. Usually, the threshold values used are 0.01 (for a confidence of 99%) or 0.05 (for a confidence of 95%). It was verified that the time-series is stationary, since a significant p -value was found (¡0.001) in the ADF test. The smoothing is selected based on data characteristics. Therefore, several smoothing methods were tested, being the Savitzky–Golay smoothing, also known as Savgol smoothing, the one that presented the best results, since it preserved the real behavior of the time-series. The Savgol smoothing [33] fits a set of points without changing the signal tendency, applying locally a polynomial function. The number of points that is applied is configurable and is called the window size. Usually it is preferred polynomials of a lower degree, and the window size needs to be bigger than the polynomial degree. The selected method parameters consider a window size of 41 and a polynomial order of 3. 4.4 Elements of the forecasting pipeline Forecasting the traffic flow can be a difficult task due to its unpredictability. We developed a pipeline for this purpose, as can be observed in Fig. 4. Data cleaning aims to eliminate the problems related to missing data, noisy data, and outliers. Since the traffic flow has few missing data, we replaced it by zeros, and through smoothing, the impact of the missing data was not significant. Smoothing also helped in the case of the existence of noise and outliers. Data transformation is usually made to ensure that there are a maximum and minimum defined. One of the ways of performing transformation is through normalization, scaling the data with a min–max scaler from −1 to 1. When we scale data, we will have to make an inverse scale before evaluating the model. Data reduction can be made by aggregating data, performing a reduction in the data that is studied, or through dimensionality reduction. In the case of traffic flow data, it is not necessary to aggregate it. However, this study is focused on just one traffic flow sensor. Relatively to dimensionality reduction, some of the original features are not used, and it is performed a feature selection between time lags (for the prediction task). Feature selection is very important because it helps reducing overfitting, improves accuracy, and reduces training time. The forecasting modules have three common steps: train the model, test the model and invert the normalization performed in the preprocessing module. The DL forecasting module has an additional step because, DL problems do not take into account time, since time by itself is not a feature. So, to overcome this shortcoming, a sequence of past occurrences is used as input on the DL algorithm. Traffic flow patterns depend on seasonality patterns. Therefore, the selection of the past occurrences is related with significant lags, i.e., select past occurrences most correlated with the present ones (e.g. a hour, a week, a month before). When choosing the best lags to build the time dependent feature, we should take into consideration the time to predict, the information we plan to use, and how correlated is the lag. With this in mind, and considering that we are predicting one week of data, it was chosen the lags: 2016, 2028, 4032, and 4044 (one week earlier, one week earlier plus an hour, two weeks earlier, two weeks earlier plus an hour). In all types of the developed networks, we have an input layer at the beginning and an output layer at the end. However, the content of the hidden layers changes. In the case of the FFNN, we considered three versions with one, two or three dense layers. In the case of the LSTM, we have just a LSTM layer. In the case of the CNN, we use two convolution layers. The hybrid network has one convolution layer, one pooling layer and one LSTM layer. The dropout does not happen always, since it is configurable. Usually, before the output layer, a flatten layer is necessary to flatten the data. 4.5 Computational platform for the pipeline automation Fig. 5 depicts the system architecture. The forecasting models run in a computational platform integrated with the existing city infrastructure. The connection to the data from Porto Digital is assured by Fiware middleware [34], a standardized open-source solution suited for smart cities use cases (Porto Digital provides an endpoint using Fiware Orion to which we connect our own instance). The Fiware Cygnus module enables data persistence in a local database. Data flows in the Fiware node are managed through publish/subscribe patterns. PostgreSQL persists the information at a long term. The cache files associated with the preprocessing module are created, and are usually unchanged. Besides that, the communication cost between the machines is significant. The cache files associated with the DL model are used to save the machine learning models. The preprocessing module is responsible for preprocessing data from flow counters. This module is connected to the forecasting modules of the traffic flow data. The anomaly module uses the DL and the statistical module to predict anomalous data. All databases and the Fiware components are deployed in Docker containers. The models that perform the preprocessing and the analysis are developed in Python 3. 5 Forecasting results This section presents the forecasting results using both SARIMA and neural networks. The machine running the tests has Ubuntu 18.04 LTS operating system, a Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-7700 CPU with 3.60 GHz frequency, 8 GB of memory and 8 cores. Since the number of tests is large, to avoid overheating problems, it is imposed a limit of CPU usage at 600% (of 800%). 5.1 Evaluation metrics Evaluation metrics measure the models’ performance, being helpful to choose the best model. These metrics will be presented in the following. Mean squared error Mean Squared Error (MSE) [35,36] can be described as in Eq. (1) (1) MSE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( Y i − Y ˆ i ) 2 , where Y i is the observed value and Y ˆ i is the predicted value. The MSE value is always larger or equal to zero. If the predicted value and the true value are equal, the error is zero. As the difference increases, the error increases. A good model has a MSE close to zero. Coefficient of determination The coefficient of determination is also known by R 2 -Score and can be calculated as in (2) (2) R 2 − Score = 1 − MSE MSE baseline , where MSE baseline is the MSE calculated using the mean of the observed value, instead of using the predicted value. A good model should have a score close to 1. The maximum value of R 2 -Score is one, and the minimum value is – ∞ . However, if the MSE is not positive, then the model is worst than the one that only predicts the mean value [37]. Akaike information criterion Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are two evaluation metrics used in statistical methods. They select the best model based on the log-likelihood and complexity of the model. AIC is based on f r e q u e n t i s t probability and penalizes less the complex models [38]. Following the work in [35], AIC is expressed by (3) AIC = 2 p − 2 ln ( L ˆ ) , where L ˆ is the likelihood and p is the number of estimated parameters. BayesIan information criterion BIC is based on Bayesian probabilities and penalizes the model with a bigger complexity. A very complex model has fewer probabilities to be chosen [38]. BIC can be obtained using AIC, as shown in Eq. (4). (4) BIC = AIC + p ( ln ( n ) − 2 ) = 2 p − 2 ln ( L ˆ ) + p ∗ ln ( n ) − 2 p = − 2 ln ( L ˆ ) + p ∗ ln ( n ) . 5.2 Forecasting with SARIMA Statistical methods like SARIMA allow to perform short-term forecasting. With SARIMA, we can just predict 12 steps that correspond to 1 h. We tested bigger values for the number of steps being forecasted ( m parameter), but the behavior of the curve was worst, or the model was too complex (when m was too big) that could not be calculated. Because of that, it is used one model for each day of the week. We use 75% of the data for training and another 25% for tests. For example, to predict the last Monday, it is used the first three Mondays to train SARIMA. The best model for each day of the week is chosen based on the results of the first forecasted hour. To forecast a hour, it is necessary, on average, 3.583 s. The first evaluation metric considered is the MSE. Nevertheless, in this study this metric provided overfitting of the model to the data. The models with the best MSE values for the first hour do not always presented good forecasting for the remaining hours. By the opposite, the values of parameters are more consistent using BIC as an evaluation metric. The obtained values are presented in Table 2. To predict more than one hour, it is initially experimented to retrain the model using the predicted values as true values; however, the model is not able to make good predictions. Using MSE, it was clear that the model was doing overfitting. Using BIC, the model would start to tend to a specific value. We then retrained both models using the true values. As can be observed in Fig. 6, both models can make good predictions. However, the model chosen by using MSE does overfitting and presents a delay of the forecasted values. This shows that, choosing BIC as an evaluation metric leads to the choice of a good model. Note that, if we decrease the number of steps, we would decrease the error; however, we want to predict as much time as possible. Considering that several sensors are distributed all over the city, one possible application of the model is to be reused on other sensors. Knowing that the traffic behavior differs between locations, we tested the models not only on the data from this sensor, but also on the nearby sensors which data highly correlates with the data from the current sensor. In general, we achieved a good performance: the MSE is low, the curve is close to the real curve, and the model does not overfit the data. 5.3 Forecasting with deep learning Using DL methods to predict future traffic flow values allows to predict, for example, one week of data. DL methods are complex, but achieve good results in long-term forecasting. Table 3 contains the possible configurations to be tested. Note that different networks have different architectures. Therefore, there are some differences between the parameters tested between the LSTM/FFNN and CNN/CNN-LSTM. Initially, we made some tests with increasing the number of neurons of the networks LSTM/FFNN. Increasing the number of neurons more than 8 did not improve the network performance, but it increased the network complexity. Because of that, we did not perform exhaustive tests with more than 8 neurons. In contrast, we decided to test the CNN-LSTM network with more than 8 neurons, since the cost and benefit trade-off was smaller. For the architecture of the CNN-LSTM network, the computational cost was less significant, and the improvement with the increase of the number of neurons was significant. We only used ReLU and l i n e a r activation functions with CNN layers because they are usually the type of functions used in this type of layers. The number of filters, the kernel size, and the pool size are only applicable to the CNN layers. For each model, 6 simulation runs were performed to chose a model not biased on the input data. We tested different FFNN topologies with networks of 1, 2, or 3 layers ( L ). The best results obtained by the application of FFNN are presented in Table 4. In all the FFNN models, the best result was obtained by having no dropout. This can reveal a big issue. Not having dropout means that the model is doing overfitting of the data. If the model does overfitting of the data, it will not have the capability to adapt over time. There is not a specific pattern relative to the activation function used; however, the s i g m o i d and the ReLU functions are relevant in the results. The evaluation metrics are all very similar for each model, being the best model, the one with 8 neurons and 2 layers. The model presents low values in the MSE, and values very close to 1 in the R 2 -Score. The R 2 -Score refers to the part of the model in which the output variable can be explained by the input variable. In a general way, the model presents a good performance. The model with 8 neurons and 2 layers is the best model; however, the first model (1 neuron and 1 layer) presents a very close MSE value and presents a much lower standard deviation. This could indicate that the first model is better than the other one. However, if a model presents an extremely small value for standard deviation, that might mean that the model will react worst to changes because it has no adaptive capabilities. The differences are small between both models, but the model with 8 neurons has better variance and R 2 -Score values, meaning that it describes better the data. In Table 5 we try to find the best models that perform dropout (0.1 or 0.2). As expected, the error values increased, and in some cases, the error increases more than the double. In most of the cases, the best models with dropout appear after several models without dropout. The best model with dropout has 8 neurons and 1 layer that uses the activation function tanh. The model presents low error values, having an MSE of 44.857 ± 0.752, and a variance and R 2 -Score close to 1. Given that the increase in the error metrics is small, it is preferable to use the best model with dropout. Fig. 7 shows the best model with dropout. We study the training times of the FFNN. Table 6 contains the times organized by the number of layers, number of neurons, and dropout ratio. We observe that the training time depends on the three factors in which the table is divided. The training time increases with the number of layers, with the number of neurons, and increases with the presence of dropout. The columns with 0.1 of dropout versus 0.2 of dropout have very similar values. LSTM neural networks are mostly used to predict sequential future values; however, they can be useful to predict other types of values. Table 7 presents the best configuration parameters for the LSTM neural network. N stands for the number of neurons, and φ stands for the activation function. There are significant improvements when we increase the number of neurons that are used in the LSTM model. The models present the same activation function and dropout value. One of the simulations that allow to obtain the best performance models is presented in Fig. 8 (containing 8 neurons). The model with 8 neurons has a low MSE. The R 2 -Score value is very close to 1. It is possible to observe that the behavior of the predicted values is very close to the behavior of the true values. There are some local maximal and minimal values that present the major differences between predicted and true values, but the predicted curve is very close to the real curve. The training time is an important factor when choosing the model. If a good model takes too long to train, it may be better to use a model with lower performance and a better training time. Table 8 presents the training time for the LSTM models. It was chosen to divide the results by the number of neurons and the dropout ratio. It is possible to conclude that the dropout ratio has an impact on the training time: increasing the dropout leads to a decrease in the training time. This happens because, by performing dropout, we are discarding information, and that information will not be used in the following steps. The number of neurons does not affect the training time, given that the values in each column are very similar. This is due to the capability of the networks to use all available processing resources regardless of the network configuration. The best model obtained with the CNN has 8 filters, a kernel size of 1, the ReLU function as activation function, and no dropout. In the hybrid network, the convolution part has 8 filters, a kernel size of 3, a pool size of 2 in the pooling layer, two activation functions (a ReLU and a l i n e a r ), and no dropout. Note that, the best model with dropout has a performance very similar to the best model without dropout, and all the other parameters are the same. The MSE increases by 0.195, the R 2 -Score is the same, and the training time increases less than 4 s. We decided to evaluate the effect of the number of Filters on the performance of the CNN model. Table 9 contains the results, which show that, increasing the number of filters increases the error and the training time. Regarding the kernel size, we cannot take conclusions, since the difference between the best model with a kernel size of 1 and the best model with a kernel size of 2 is not significant (see Table 10). The overall results are presented in Table 11. The best performance is obtained with the CNN. The CNN model achieves the best MSE, the best R 2 -Score, and the best training time. The second-best model is the hybrid model, followed by the LSTM and the FFNN model. The LSTM model is the model that presents a higher training time — this happens because of the nature of the LSTM networks. The presented work was specific for a traffic flow sensor. One of the goals was to forecast the values of other sensors without having to repeat all the work. A direct application of the models cannot be performed because we trained the model with the values of the specific traffic flow. To reuse the developed work, we will train new models with the same parameters, but with the historic values of the specific traffic flow. We tested the performance for a traffic flow sensor that presented high correlation values with the specific sensor. With SARIMA, we obtained an MSE of 0.315 and a BIC of 1209.070 for the first forecasted hour of Monday. The error remained low when predicting the following hours, with an average error of 16.658. In the case of the ANNs, the results are presented in Table 12. The best results are obtained with the model FFNN; however, the results obtained using a CNN are very close to the ones obtained using a FFNN. Note that the range of values is smaller for this sensor, and that can lead to smaller errors. CNN seems the most appropriate ANN to use to predict the traffic flow. The architecture of the CNN that presented the best results is presented in Fig. 9. As can be observed, we have several sequential layers: an input layer, several hidden layers, and one output layer. In the hidden layers, we have 1-Dimensional (1D) convolutional layers with 8 filters, layers with ReLUs as activation functions, and a flatten layer. Some FFNNs achieve better results but do not perform dropout, meaning that they are more sensitive to changes and they are, most likely, performing overfitting. SARIMA models presented good results, but they cannot perform long-term forecasting with a good performance. LSTMs present bigger training times, but they are small in a week time frame. 6 Abnormal traffic behavior Anomaly detection allows to recognize that the present or near future conditions of the city (its traffic) are uncommon, given the observed history. Anomaly detection is difficult to perform because it is, in most of the cases, unexpected. However, there are a few cases in which we can predict that it will happen something unusual. Since we expect to observe patterns in traffic as a result of calendar seasonality, we can also expect the existence of anomalies when there is something that is not dictated by the usual seasonality. 6.1 Detecting an anomaly The best example to identify an anomaly is when a holiday occurs. November 1st is a religious holiday celebrated in Portugal. In 2019, this holiday occurred on a Friday, being the perfect candidate for our study. Since this holiday happens one week after the last week in the study, it is chosen to analyze the next week based on the models previously calculated to verify their behavior. Besides that, it is also performed some analysis that can help to detect some anomalies. In Fig. 10, we observe that, in the week from October 27 of 2019 to November 3 of 2019, it is possible to detect the anomaly presented in the holiday. The traffic values are much lower than on the Fridays of the other weeks. The holiday even presents lower values than Saturday and Sunday. To start the processing, it is performed the smoothing of the time-series, and the seasonal decomposition from October 7 to November 3. By looking into Fig. 11, we can observe the presence of the anomaly. The observed component is the time-series after it is performed the smoothing step, and, once more, we can visualize a decrease in the values corresponding to the holiday. In the residual component, there is a significant decrease in the holiday, highlighting the anomaly. It is also possible to visualize a decrease in the trend component, even before the holiday. This indicates that the existence of a holiday in a Friday allows that some people take some additional vacation days. The only component in which the anomaly is not visible is the seasonal component. This happens because the seasonal component only retains the patterns, the seasonal and cyclic patterns. Since every year the weekday in which the holiday happens changes, it would be very difficult to have a pattern with just one or two years of information. It would be necessary much more information to detect and study the pattern presented in the holiday. The residual component is the component that contains the anomaly. To detect and isolate the anomaly, we should focus on what happens in this component. In this case, the anomaly generates a decrease in traffic. In Fig. 12, a marked pattern is found corresponding to the traffic anomaly; it corresponds to the analysis after performing a day resample. Resample data by day is useful if we expect anomalies for an entire day, but for detecting more isolated anomalies, like accidents, it might be more useful not to perform the resample or just resample in one hour interval. If the anomalies can affect an entire week, like the academic week in the university, we might even have to perform the resample by week. 6.2 Anomalous traffic impact in short and long-term forecasting Although we can determine the anomaly, the real question is if it is possible to forecast the traffic flow even when there is an anomaly. To answer this question, we first started with SARIMA model. Fig. 13 presents the forecasting done with SARIMA. We observe that the SARIMA model presents a good performance. However, one disadvantage of using SARIMA is that we have to retrain the model at each hour. The same did not happen when we try to apply the ANNs, as can be observed in Table 13. Since DL models were trained to perform long-term forecasts, the DL models did not contain any information that the anomaly occurred. As such, those models were not able to get good results, and there is a huge difference between the predicted values and the true values for the November 1st, as we can see in Fig. 14. Even when the previous hour was added to the features group, in order to verify the impact in the predicted values, there was not a significant improvement. Note that all lags present a strong correlation with lag 0, meaning that the use of lag 12 is not important, and that might be the reason why the model does not adapt. One of the reasons why we get better results with SARIMA than with ANNs is due to the capability of SARIMA to look into data as a sequence. However, some ANN models, such as LSTM, are a type of model for sequential data and cannot adapt. This might be due to ANNs being formatted to receive input data and output data, and not pure sequential data. By analyzing the residual component or the error component, it is possible to detect the anomalies; however, the detection just happens after they occur. Is it also possible to detect them when they occur, if we use SARIMA, but it is not possible to detect them far in advance. Through these results, we conclude that both statistical models and ANNs have different purposes, and in the traffic flow prediction, they will provide differentiated and opposite performance for short- and long-term forecasting. The automatic selection of the forecasting method, through the use of a hybrid method, is key for the autonomous forecasting of traffic flow in roads through traffic counters. 7 Conclusions Improving smart urban mobility can have several positive impacts on the city and its citizens. For example, the identification of problematic traffic zones can lead the responsible authorities to implement measures to combat the problems. In this paper, our aim was to make the best use of the resources available in Oporto to support its management. In this paper, time-series analysis helped in the identification of patterns and problems. Using real traffic counters deployed in the city, we were able to infer traffic conditions and seasonalities. It was possible to forecast one week of the traffic flow through traffic counters, by using DL methods, such as FFNNs, LSTMs, CNNs and hybrid LSTM-CNN models; however, we found some limitations with respect to forecasting anomalies. While SARIMA models were able to adapt and make good predictions even in the presence of anomalies, the machine learning methods were not able to do the same. One of the reasons is that they were designed to make long-term forecasting. However, with SARIMA we can only forecast one hour. When we try to forecast more than one hour, the model presented worst results or was too complex to be calculated. Considering the proposed DL methods, CNNs have shown to be efficient and robust since they always presented the lowest errors and low training times. This is, therefore, the approach we consider the best for flow prediction through traffic counters in the roads. The study of smart urban mobility is far from being completely explored. As future work, we plan to test new algorithms for anomaly detection (road accidents, holidays, constructions, etc.), to detect anomalies that happen during short or long-term periods. This can be done through a hybrid method composed by statistical and neural network approaches.

As a result, methods that allow their understanding, characterization, and classification have been under the attention in recent years. The main objective of this work is to investigate the feasibility of characterizing emotions from facial electromyogram (EMG) signals. For that, we rely on the EMG signals, from the frontal and zygomatic muscles, collected on 37 participants while emotional conditions were induced by visual content, namely fear, joy, or neutral. Using only the entropy of the EMG signals, from the frontal and zygomatic muscles, we can distinguish, respectively, neutral and joy conditions for 70% and 84% of the participants, fear and joy conditions for 81% and 92% of the participants and neutral, and fear conditions for 65% and 70% of the participants. These results show that opposite emotional conditions are easier to distinguish through the information of EMG signals. Moreover, we can also conclude that the information from the zygomatic muscle allowed to characterized more participants with respect to the 3 emotional conditions induced. The characterization of emotions through EMG signals opens the possibility for a classification system for emotion classification relying only on EMG information. This has the advantages of micro-expressions detection, signal constant collection, and no need to acquire face images. This work is a first step towards the automatic classification of emotions based solely on facial EMG.",

This paper presents a method to detect potential hazard driving zones. We mapped bus GPS positions into road segments, and we used bus speed, bus maximum allowed speed, and bus acceleration to classify the driving behavior. We develop an interactive web application that maps tracking data and provides rich visual insights on potentially problematic areas. Side-by-side visualizations help with the comparison of the traffic behavior in selected periods. We show that we can map the most problematic zones in the city and the time of the day. From the developed analysis, it is observed that some roads in the city present a daily seasonality (problems occur in the same period of the day); however, other roads present circulation issues independently of the time period or day.",

However, these assessment methods are subjective, discontinuous, and inadequate for evaluating the pain of patients unable or with limited ability to communicate verbally. Developing an objective and continuous tool for assessing and monitoring postoperative pain, which does not require patient reports could assist pain management during the patient stay in the post-surgery care unit and, ultimately, promote better recovery. In the last years, the evaluation of pain through physiological indicators has been investigated. In the present work, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals collected from 19 patients during the postoperative period were studied in order to find relationships between physiological alterations and pain and identify which ECG-feature or combination of ECG-features better describe postoperative pain. Considering a multivariate approach, analysing the performance of sets of two or more ECG-features using clustering algorithms proved to be promising, allowing the identification of different pain characteristics based on the extracted features from the ECG signals.",

In addition, and regarding the field of biometrics, it is equally important to ensure a low degree of intra-subject variability in the extracted heartbeats in order to enhance the ability of classifiers to differentiate individuals. Therefore, the present work focuses on the development of a new algorithm aimed at extracting outliers and, simultaneously, maximizing the similarity between heartbeats. To this end, the developed method entails two distinct phases, the first one foreseeing the elimination of irregular heartbeats according to the variance of pre-defined features while the second phase selects heartbeats through the application of Normalized Cross-Correlation. An analysis of the results based on the average variance and average range of the obtained heartbeats demonstrates the capacity of the algorithm to reject noisy segments and guarantee the extraction of heartbeats with highly homogeneous characteristics. As such, the developed methodology holds considerable promise to be integrated in ECG-based biometric systems or medical applications.",

The State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA) is a self-report instrument developed to provide multidimensional anxiety assessment in four dimensions: trait-cognitive, trait-somatic, state-cognitive and state-somatic. This research aimed to extend STICSA’s psychometric studies through the assessment of its dimensionality, reliability, measurement invariance and nomological validity in the Portuguese population. Additionally, the predictive validity of STICSA-Trait was also evaluated, through the analysis of the relationship between self-reported trait anxiety and both the subjective and the psychophysiological response across distinct emotional situations. Similarly to previous studies, results supported both a four-factor and two separated bi-factor structures. Measurement invariance across sex groups was also supported, and good nomological validity was observed. Moreover, STICSA trait-cognitive dimension was associated with differences in self-reported arousal between groups of high/low anxiety, whereas STICSA trait-somatic dimension was related to differences in both the subjective and psychophysiological response. Together, these results support STICSA as a useful instrument for a broader anxiety assessment, crucial for an informed diagnosis and practice.",

Notwithstanding, they may also be used as the input for a biometric identification system. Several studies, as well as some prototypes, are already based on this principle. One of the methods already used for biometric identification relies on a measure of similarity based on the Kolmogorov Com-plexity, called the Normalized Relative Compression (NRC)—this approach evaluates the similarity between two ECG segments without the need to delineate the signal wave. This methodology is the basis of the present work. We have collected a dataset of ECG signals from twenty participants on two different sessions, making use of three different kits simultaneously—one of them using dry electrodes, placed on their fingers; the other two using wet sensors placed on their wrists and chests. The aim of this work was to study the influence of the ECG protocol collection, regarding the biometric identification system’s performance. Several variables in the data acquisition are not controllable, so some of them will be inspected to understand their influence in the system. Move-ment, data collection point, time interval between train and test datasets and ECG segment duration are examples of variables that may affect the system, and they are studied in this paper. Through this study, it was concluded that this biometric identification system needs at least 10 s of data to guarantee that the system learns the essential information. It was also observed that “off-the-person” data acquisition led to a better performance over time, when compared to “on-the-person” places.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 1963-2012 IEEE.Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometric recognition as a personal identification method is receiving more and more attention because it can support live verification results. Compared with other biometric-based methods, it can provide higher security performance. The difficulty of the problem lies in how to stably extract ECG signal features and achieve real-time verification. In this study, a new type of sparse representation learning framework called statistical $n$ -best adaptive Fourier decomposition (SAFD) originated by Qian is adopted in ECG biometric identification. Adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) is a recently developed combination of transform-based signal decomposition and sparse representation method, which can adaptively select the atoms from a redundant dictionary through orthogonal processing. The advantage of the AFD-type methods is that each atom in the dictionary has a precise mathematical formula with good analytic properties. This characteristic is significantly distinguished it from other existing sparse representations, where the atoms learned are usually matrix data and cannot be described mathematically. The proposed SAFD extends the existing $n$ -best AFD from processing single signal to multi-signals and implements the $n$ -best AFD in the stochastic Hardy space. Therefore, the small number of learned atoms by SAFD is sufficient to capture internal structure and robustness of the signal and generate a discriminative representation that reflects the time-frequency characteristics of signals. It is very suitable for non-stationary signals like ECG. The proof of convergence of the algorithm is presented. Extensive experiments are conducted on five public databases collected in different realistic conditions, and an average identification accuracy of 98.0% is achieved. In addition, less than 1 ms for one matching process makes it possible to be implemented in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art ECG biometric identification methods.",

Emotion identification may improve peoples’ emotion regulation strategies and interaction with multiple life contexts. Several studies have investigated emotion classification systems, but most of them are based on the analysis of only one, a few, or isolated physiological signals. Understanding how informative the individual signals are and how their combination works would allow to develop more cost-effective, informative, and objective systems for emotion detection, processing, and interpretation. In the present work, electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrodermal activity were processed in order to find a physiological model of emotions. Both a unimodal and a multimodal approach were used to analyze what signal, or combination of signals, may better describe an emotional response, using a sample of 55 healthy subjects. The method was divided in: (1) signal preprocessing; (2) feature extraction; (3) classification using random forest and neural networks. Results suggest that the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is the most effective for emotion classification. Yet, the combination of all signals provides the best emotion identification performance, with all signals providing crucial information for the system. This physiological model of emotions has important research and clinical implications, by providing valuable information about the value and weight of physiological signals for emotional classification, which can critically drive effective evaluation, monitoring and intervention, regarding emotional processing and regulation, considering multiple contexts.",

In interactive systems, the user’s emotional state can be relevant to provide increased levels of adaptation to the user, but can also be paramount in scenarios where such information might enable us to help users manage and express their emotions (e.g., anxiety), with a positive impact on their daily life and on how they interact with others. However, although there is a clear potential for emotionally-aware applications, they still have a long road to travel to reach the desired potential and availability. This is mostly due to the still low translational nature of the research in affective computing, and to the lack of straightforward, off-the-shelf methods for easy integration of emotion in applications without the need for developers to master the different concepts and technologies involved. In light of these challenges, we advance our previous work and propose an extended conceptual vision for supporting emotionally-aware interactive ecosystems and a fast track to ensure the desired translational nature of the research in affective computing. This vision then leads to the proposal of an improved iteration of a generic affective modality, a key resource to the accomplishment of the proposed vision, enabling off-the-shelf support for emotionally-aware applications in multimodal interactive contexts.",

In the present work, we target the electrocardiogram (ECG) response as a mean to express emotions. Its processing is performed using information-theoretical measures, allowing true exploratory data mining. Participants recruited for the experiment watched three video sets in three different days, with a different emotion being induced in each day: fear, happiness, and neutral condition. The method is divided in: (1) conversion of the real-valued ECG record into a symbolic time-series; (2) relative compression of the symbolic representation of the ECG, using the symbolic ECG records stored in the database as a reference; (3) identification of the ECG record class, using a 1-NN (nearest neighbor) classifier. An accuracy of 90% was obtained. A posteriori analysis of the false negative results indicated that there was a relation between the relative dissimilarity measure and the self-reported emotions.",

However, the best results are usually achieved by the methods that, at least, rely on one point of interest of the ECG – called fiducial methods. In this work, we propose a compression-based non-fiducial method, that uses a measure of similarity, called the Normalized Relative Compression—a measure related to the Kolmogorov complexity of strings. Our method uses extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCMs) on the quantized first-order derivative of the signal, instead of using directly the original signal, as other methods do.

Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Previous studies have successfully used augmented reality (AR) as an aid to exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have measured the physiological correlates of the fear response, relying solely on self-reports and behavioral avoidance tests. Methods: As the physiological defensive reactivity pattern impacts on the treatment effectiveness, we tested the feasibility of an AR system integrated in a mobile and wearable device for assessing the psychophysiological mechanisms (heart rate) involved in fear responses in real-life contexts. Specific phobia was used as a model given its prototypical defensive hyperreactivity toward the feared stimulus (spiders to spider phobics, in the current study). Results: The results showed that the stimuli presented using AR were able to induce physiological alterations in the participants, which were specific depending on the stimulus type (fear or neutral) and on the participants’ level of spider fear (phobic and control group). These physiological correlates of the fear response were reflected both in the intensity of heart rate (in relation to the baseline) and in the time needed to react and recover after the stimulus exposure. Finally, we tested a theoretical model that showed that the physiological responses of phobic individuals when facing their phobic stimulus only explained its own data. Conclusions: We argue in favor of the system's feasibility at capturing and quantifying the physiological dimension of fear-related responses, which may be of great value for diagnostic and treatment purposes in anxiety disorders, namely specific phobia.",

It has been successfully used in different applications, like DNA sequences, images or even ECG (electrocardiographic) signal. It uses a compressor that compresses a target string using exclusively the information contained in a reference string. One possible approach is to use finite-context models (FCMs) to represent the strings. A finite-context model calculates the probability distribution of the next symbol, given the previous k symbols. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of the FCMs, called extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCM), that calculates the probability of occurrence of the next d symbols, given the previous k symbols. We perform experiments on two different sample applications using the xaFCMs and the NRC measure: ECG biometric identification, using a publicly available database; estimation of the similarity between DNA sequences of two different, but related, species – chromosome by chromosome. In both applications, we compare the results against those obtained by the FCMs. The results show that the xaFCMs use less memory and computational time to achieve the same or, in some cases, even more accurate results.",

The normalized relative compression (NRC) is a recent dissimilarity measure, related to the Kolmogorov complexity. It has been successfully used in different applications, like DNA sequences, images or even ECG (electrocardiographic) signal. It uses a compressor that compresses a target string using exclusively the information contained in a reference string. One possible approach is to use finite-context models (FCMs) to represent the strings. A finite-context model calculates the probability distribution of the next symbol, given the previous k symbols. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of the FCMs, called extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCM), that calculates the probability of occurrence of the next d symbols, given the previous k symbols. We perform experiments on two different sample applications using the xaFCMs and the NRC measure: ECG biometric identification, using a publicly available database; estimation of the similarity between DNA sequences of two different, but related, species – chromosome by chromosome. In both applications, we compare the results against those obtained by the FCMs. The results show that the xaFCMs use less memory and computational time to achieve the same or, in some cases, even more accurate results. 1 Introduction Data compression models have been used to address several data mining and machine learning problems, usually by means of a formalization in terms of the information content of a string or of the information distance between strings [1–5]. This approach relies on solid foundations of the concept of algorithmic entropy and, because of its non-computability, approximations provided by data compression algorithms [6]. A finite-context model (FCM) calculates the probability distribution of the next symbol, given the previous k symbols. In this work, we propose an extension of the FCMs, which we call extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCM). Usually, these models provide better compression ratios, leading to better results for some applications, especially when using small alphabet sizes – and also by performing much less computations. We show this in practice for the ECG biometric identification and DNA sequence similarity. The source code for the compressor was implemented using Python 3.5 and is publicly available under the GPL v3 license. 1 1 1.1 Compression-based measures Compression-based distances are tightly related to the Kolmogorov notion of complexity, also known as algorithmic entropy. Let x denote a binary string of finite length. Its Kolmogorov complexity, K(x), is the length of the shortest binary program x* that computes x in a universal Turing machine and halts. Therefore, K ( x ) = | x * | , the length of x*, represents the minimum number of bits from which x can be computationally retrieved [7]. The Information Distance (ID) and its normalized version, the Normalized Information Distance (NID), were proposed by Bennett et al. almost two decades ago [8] and are defined in terms of the Kolmogorov complexity of the strings involved, as well as the complexity of one when the other is provided. However, since the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is not computable, an approximation (upper bound) for it can be used by means of a compressor. Let C(x) be the number of bits used by a compressor to represent the string x. We will use a measure based on the notion of relative compression [4], denoted by C(x||y), which represents the compression of x relatively to y. This measure obeys the following rules: • C(x||y) ≈ 0 iff string x can be built efficiently from y; • C(x||y) ≈ |x| iff K(x|y) ≈ K(x). Based on these rules, the Normalized Relative Compression (NRC) of the binary string x given the binary string y, is defined as (1) NRC ( x ∥ y ) = C ( x ∥ y ) | x | , where |x| denotes the length of x. A more general formula for the NRC of string x, given string y, where the strings x and y are sequences from an alphabet A = { s 1 , s 2 , ⋯ s | A | } , is given by (2) NRC ( x ∥ y ) = C ( x ∥ y ) | x | log 2 | A | . 2 Extended-alphabet finite-context models 2.1 Compressing using extended-alphabet finite-context models Let A = { s 1 , s 2 , ⋯ s | A | } be the alphabet that describes the objects of interest. An extended-alphabet finite-context model (xaFCM) complies to the Markov property, i.e., it estimates the probability of the next sequence of d > 0 symbols of the information source (depth-d) using the k > 0 immediate past symbols (order-k context). Therefore, assuming that the k past outcomes are given by x n − k + 1 n = x n − k + 1 … x n , the probability estimates, P ( x n + 1 n + d | x n − k + 1 n ) are calculated using sequence counts that are accumulated, while the information source is processed, (3) P ( w | x n − k + 1 n ) = v ( w | x n − k + 1 n ) + α v ( x n − k + 1 n ) + α | A | d where A d = { w 1 , w 2 , ⋯ w | A | , … w | A | d } is an extension of alphabet A to d dimensions, v ( w | x n − k + 1 n ) represents the number of times that, in the past, sequence w ∈ A d was found having x n − k + 1 n as the conditioning context and where (4) v ( x n − k + 1 n ) = ∑ a ∈ A d v ( a | x n − k + 1 n ) denotes the total number of events that has occurred within context x n − k + 1 n . In order to avoid problems with “shifting” of the data, the sequence counts are performed symbol by symbol, when learning a model from a string. Parameter α allows controlling the transition from an estimator initially assuming a uniform distribution to a one progressively closer to the relative frequency estimator. The theoretical information content average provided by the ith sequence of d symbols from the original sequence x, is given by (5) − log 2 P ( X i = t i | x i d − k i d − 1 ) bits, where t i = x i d , x i d + 1 … x ( i + 1 ) d − 1 . As testbed applications, we perform ECG biometric identification and compute a similarity measure between DNA sequences;After processing the first n symbols of x, the total number of bits generated by an order-k with depth-d xaFCM is equal to (6) − ∑ i = 1 n / d log 2 P ( t i | x d i − k d i − 1 ) , where, for simplicity, we assume that n ( m o d d ) = 0 . If we consider a xaFCM with depth d = 1 , then it becomes a regular FCM with the same order k. In that sense, we can consider that a FCM is a particular case of a xaFCM. An intuitive way of understanding how a xaFCM works is to think of it as a FCM which, for each context of length k, instead of counting the number of occurrences of symbols of A , counts the occurrences of sequences w ∈ A d . In other words, for each sequence of length k found, it counts the number of times each sequence of d symbols appeared right after it. Even though, when implemented, this might use more memory to represent the model, an advantage is that it is possible to compress a new sequence of length m, relatively to some previously constructed model, making only m/d accesses to the model. This significantly reduces the time of computation, as we will show in the experimental results presented in Sections 3 and 4. Since, for compressing the first k symbols of a sequence, we do not have enough symbols to represent a context of length k, we always assume that the sequence is “circular”. For long sequences, specially using small contexts/depths, this should not make much difference in terms of compression, but as the contexts/depths increase, this might not be always the case. Since the purpose for which we use these models is to provide an approximation for the number of bits that would be produced by a compressor based on them, whenever we use the word “compression”, in fact we are not performing the compression itself. For that, we would need to use an encoder, which would take more time to compute. It would also be needed to add some side information for the compressor to deal with the circular sequences – but that goes out of scope for our goal. 2.1.1 Example Let x be the circular sequence AAABCC. Using a regular FCM with k = 2 and α = 0.01 , we would build the model from Table 1 to represent x. It is easy to notice that this representation can be implemented using an hash-table of strings to arrays of integers with fixed size (alphabet size + 1 ). However, we propose a different alternative, which consists of building a hash-table of hash-tables. The reason for doing so is that often the number of counts of symbols for each context is very sparse, which would be a waste of memory. To represent exactly the same model, we would build the structure presented in Table 2 . For compressing the sequence x, relatively to itself, we would need C(x||x) bits, where (7) C ( x ∥ x ) = C ( A | C C ) + C ( A | C A ) + C ( A | A A ) + C ( B | A A ) + C ( C | A B ) + C ( C | B C ) and, (8) C ( A | C C ) = C ( A | C A ) = C ( C | A B ) = C ( C | B C ) = − log 2 1 + 0.01 1 + 3 × 0.01 = 0.0283 and (9) C ( A | A A ) = C ( B | A A ) = − log 2 2 + 0.01 1 + 3 × 0.01 = 1.007 , which means C ( x ∥ x ) = 2.1272 or, in other words, it is possible to compress x relatively to itself using just 2.1272 bits. Using a xaFCM, also with k = 2 and α = 0.01 , but with d = 2 , we would build the model presented in Table 3 to represent x. Therefore, (10) C ( x ∥ x ) = C ( A A | C C ) + C ( A B | A A ) + C ( C C | A B ) where, (11) C ( A A | C C ) = C ( C C | A B ) = − log 2 1 + 0.01 1 + 3 2 × 0.01 = 0.110 and (12) C ( A B | A A ) = − log 2 1 + 0.01 2 + 3 2 × 0.01 = 1.049 which means C ( x ∥ x ) = 1.269 or, in other words, using a xaFCM to represent the sequence x it is possible to compress it relatively to itself using just 1.269 bits. Calculating the NRC for both compressors we obtain: • Using FCM – NRC ( x ∥ x ) = 2.1272 6 × log 2 3 = 0.224 ; • Using xaFCM – NRC ( x ∥ x ) = 1.049 6 × log 2 3 = 0.110 . Based on this example, we can infer that, at least for some cases, it is possible to obtain better compression ratios, using xaFCMs instead of traditional FCMs to represent a sequence. 2.2 Parameter selection 2.2.1 Selection of α Since adjusting the α parameter might not be trivial, as it depends on the choice of d as well as on the alphabet size. It is, however, possible to choose α based on a certain desired probability p for a specific outcome. In our experiments, in order to avoid having one more parameter to “tweak”, we are defining α automatically, in a way such that, if sequence w ∈ A d was only found once after a certain context c = x n − k + 1 n ∈ x , and no other sequence ∈ A d was found after that context c (in other words, the total of that line, in the model, is 1), we want to be 90% sure that the same situation happens when compressing a sequence relatively to the learned model. In other words, when we calculate the number of bits, (13) − log 2 P ( X i = t i | c ) needed to compress sequence t i = x i d , x i d + 1 … x i d + d − 1 , we want to choose an α such that (14) P ( X i = t i | c ) = 0 . 9 d . But, since (15) P ( w | c ) = v ( w | c ) + α v ( c ) + α | A | d , where, we have chosen c and w such that v ( c ) = v ( w | c ) = 1 . Therefore (16a) P ( w | c ) = 0 . 9 d ⇔ 1 + α 1 + α | A | d = 0 . 9 d . Since A d is an extension of A to d dimensions, (16b) 1 + α 1 + α | A | d = 0 . 9 d . Also, since both the alphabet size A and the depth d are static parameters, it is easy to solve the equation and choose α in this way. It is also worth mentioning that there is always a possible solution for the equation, since the denominator of the fraction on the left is never equal to zero. 2.2.2 Selection of d The parameter d is an integer greater or equal to one. As mentioned in Section 2.1, when d = 1 , we are using a xaFCM which is equivalent to a FCM of the same order k. Therefore, they both produce exactly the same number of bits. As d increases, so does the RAM needed to store the xaFCM model – but there is not much of an impact (for d = 11 the increase in memory usage is about 10%). The reason for the model complexity to only increase this is that the number of different “leaves” in the hash-tables does not change with the choice of d – only the size of each string stored does. Something to take into account when choosing d is that, the greater the value of d, the harder it would be for an arithmetic encoder to complete its process. Since we only want to compute the NRC, we do not use an encoder. However, to avoid unrealistic results, we want to choose a d that produces an alphabet size of, at most, the MaximumValue(integer) − 1 (e.g. 2 31 − 1 ) symbols. For that reason, using an alphabet of size 6, we can say that 1 ≤ d ≤ 11. Often, we are mostly interested in the time it takes to compress a new target sequence, given an already built model representing the reference sequence. With this application in mind, we can say for sure that the d should be as big as possible, since, as mentioned before, less computations need to be done to compress a new target sequence and, therefore, much less time is needed. Results from real experiments can be seen in the next section. 3 Application 1 – ECG biometric identification In previous works, we have addressed the topic of ECG based biometric identification using a measure of similarity related to the Kolmogorov complexity, called the normalized relative compression (NRC). To attain the goal, we built finite-context models (FCM) to represent each individual [9,10] – a compression-based approach that has been shown successful for different pattern recognition applications [2,4,11]. Other recent works, also based on a compression approach, use the Ziv–Merhav cross parsing algorithm for attaining the same goal [12,13]. Compression-based approaches found in the literature for ECG biometric identification does not seem to take advantage of the fact that the ECG is a quasi-periodical time-series. Since our method uses a semi-fiducial approach (it only detects the R-peak), it is trivial to know where the repetition should happen and take advantage of that fact. From previous results [14], we concluded that, when consecutive heartbeats 2 2 For readability, by “heartbeat” we mean the interval between two consecutive R-peaks. present low levels of noise, their quantization is almost identical. As a consequence of this, we consider that any sequence we analyze is a circular sequence [15]. From this result, it is possible to infer that, compressing the beginning of an heartbeat using the end of the same heartbeat, may be identical to compress it using the end of the previous heartbeat. This may not sound as an advantage, however, this fact allows us to use heartbeats that are not consecutive, when performing the identification of a participant. Since the purpose of this paper is to introduce the method, and not to focus too much in the ECG signal, we do not explore this fact. However, it is already being taken it into account when building the algorithm (one of the arguments that the algorithm accepts as input is the length of the expected repetition – i.e. for this application, how many symbols has one heartbeat), because it will be important for building a real system, as we expect more noise to be present and, therefore, some segments need to be discarded when performing the compression [14]. 3.1 R-peak detection The development of a robust automatic R-peak detector is essential, but it is still a challenging task, due to irregular heart rates, various amplitude levels and QRS morphologies, as well as all kinds of noise and artifacts [16]. We decided to use a semi-fiducial method for segmenting the ECG signal and, since this was not the major focus of the work, we used a preexisting implementation to detect R-peaks, based on the method proposed in [16]. The reason for using a semi-fiducial approach is that fiducial methods have a higher error of detection, while detecting the R-peaks is, nowadays, an almost trivial process [16]. The method used detects the R-peaks by calculating the average points between the Q and S points (from the QRS-complexes) – this may not give the real local maxima corresponding to the R-peaks, but it produces a very close point. For more information regarding the process used for detecting the R-peaks check [16]. The process was already validated by its authors using the standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, achieving an average sensitivity of 99.94% and a positive predictivity of 99.96%. It uses bandpass filtering and differentiation operations, aiming to enhance the QRS complexes and to reduce out-of-band noise. A nonlinear transformation is used to obtain a positive-valued feature signal, which includes large candidate peaks corresponding to the QRS complex regions. 3.2 Quantization Data compression algorithms are symbolic in nature. Text and DNA sequences are well-known examples of symbolic sequences, with well-defined associated alphabets. Contrarily the ECG signal needs first to be transformed into symbols before data compression can be applied. In this work, we have relied on the SAX (Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation) representation [17] to transform the ECG into a symbolic time-series. We consider that the signal is already discrete in the time domain, i.e., that it is already sampled. However, we perform re-sampling using the previously detected R-peaks. There is a fundamental trade-off to take into account while performing the choice of the alphabet size: the quality produced versus the amount of data necessary to represent the sequence [18]. We tested the experiments using alphabet sizes from 3 up to 20 symbols and using different numbers of symbols each R-R segment (per heartbeat), and found that a combination of using an alphabet size of 6 and 200 symbols per heartbeat produced a good balance between the complexity of the strings/models and the accuracies obtained for biometric identification, allowing us to proceed with the improvement of the compressors, while these parameters remained static. However, this result does not guarantee that the same will hold true for a different dataset or application, nor does it guarantee that these are the optimal parameters. Future work is needed to perform this choice in a more robust and automatic way. 3.3 Experimental results The database used in our experiments was collected in house [10,19], where 25 participants were exposed to different external stimuli – disgust, fear and neutral. Data were collected on three different days (once per week), at the University of Aveiro, using a different stimulus per day. The data signals were collected during 25 min on each day, giving a total of around 75 minof ECG signal per participant. Before being exposed to the stimuli, during the first 4 min of each data acquisition, the participants watched a movie with a beach sunset and an acoustic guitar soundtrack, and were instructed to try to relax as much as possible. By using a database where the participants were exposed to different stimuli, we can check if the emotional state of participants affects the biometric identification process. The database is publicly available for download in. 3 3 After all the already explained preprocessing steps are complete, the process in which we perform the biometric identification is the following: 1. Use the complete ECG signals from two days, in order to build a xaFCM model that describes each of the participants; 2. For the remaining day, split the signal, such that each segment has 10 consecutive heartbeats inside it; 3. “Compress” (compute the NRC) each of the segments obtained in the previous step using each of the models obtained in the first step; 4. The model which produces a lowest result is chosen as the candidate for biometric identification. The justification for the first step is that we do not want to use any information from the ECG of the day where we are trying to perform the ECG biometric identification, since, if we used that information, our results would not match a real situation. The number of heartbeats needed for ECG biometric identification is undoubtedly useful when building a biometric identification system – any system should ask participants to provide data for identification, using the smallest time interval that is possible, for practical reasons. Based on the results from a previous study [10], we concluded that 10 heartbeats is a good trade-off between collection time (which should be as low as possible) and statistical relevance of the data. All the experiments were implemented and ran using Python 3.5 (Linux 64 bits) on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40 GHz, with 32GB of RAM. For simplicity of code, we have not parallelized the process yet – therefore, only one logical core was used for each experiment. In Fig. 1 , it is possible to see a plot with the accuracy obtained for the process described, by using FCM models, with all possible values of k from 1 up to 20. In the red line, it is also possible to see how much time does this process take in total. An important fact is that the time taken to perform the biometry is approximately directly proportional to the size of the context, k, used. Since the purpose of this paper is to show the appropriateness of xaFCM models, in Fig. 2 are shown six examples of the same experiment, but instead of changing the context k, we have chosen a fixed value of k and tested all possible values of d, the depth of the xaFCMs. From these plots, it is possible to see that the time taken to perform the biometry process for the whole database is up to 3–4 times shorter when using high values of d, having, usually, accuracy ratios comparable with the FCMs of the same order k. On the experiments using “lower” values for the context k (in this case, k ≤ 14), it is possible to notice a minor improvement in terms of accuracy as the d increases, at least for the first values of d (d ≤ 7, more or less). This makes us think that increasing the depth d behaves in a similar way to increasing the depth k of the xaFCM, without the additional cost in terms of testing speed (quite the opposite, actually) and the memory needed does not increase so much as it would by increasing k (Fig. 3 ). In higher contexts k we get the same advantages in terms of computing time and memory requirements, however, after a certain point, there is just no real benefit from increasing neither the context k, nor the depth d, since we are looking for “too specific” patterns, that may not appear again on the segments being tested – which, making an analogy to machine learning, we would be overfitting to the training data. Another aspect we wanted to show, regarding the advantages of using xaFCMs, is the model complexity. In order for the biometric identification to be executed fast, in practice, it is needed to have all the participant models previously loaded into memory. This usually does not pose a problem, if there are not many participants, but it may be useful for building a real biometric identification system. In Fig. 3, we can see that by increasing the context k of FCM models, the complexity of each model increases exponentially. From our interpretation, a way to avoid this exponential increase is to use an xaFCM with an order slightly lower and increase its depth d. In order to show this, we display the complexity of such models in Fig. 4 . 4 Application 2 – DNA sequence relative similarity An approach for computing the similarity of a sequence relatively to other is to calculate the NRC using one of them as reference and the other as the target. In previous works, this has been done using FCM compressors [2,20–22]. In order to show that the xaFCMs are also suitable for this application, we ran some simulations using the human and chimpanzee DNA sequences, removing the unknown symbols (N). The idea was to use each chromosome of the human species as reference and then compress each chromosome of chimpanzee as the target, using exclusively the model from the reference. Since we know from evolution theory that these two species are closely related [23], it is expected that, when we are compressing homologous pairs of chromosomes, the NRC should be lower than on the other cases. To perform the experiment, we used the assembled human chromosomes 1–22, X and Y (3.1GB of data in total) and assembled chimpanzee chromosomes 1, 2a, 2b, 3 to 22, X and Y (3.2GB of data in total). 4 4 All the assembled genome data were downloaded from We ran two different simulations: the first one, with a FCM of context k = 12 ; the other with a xaFCM with k = 12 and d = 8 . All the experiments ran on a server with 16-cores 2.13 GHz Intel Xeon CPU E7320 and 256GB of RAM, but the implementation used a single core. Table 4 shows the average times taken by each experiment, as well as the average memory needed to store the xaFCM model to represent the human chromosomes. It is clear from these results that the xaFCMs are almost d times faster than an FCM of the same order k. Another advantage is that the memory needed for the xaFCMs does not increase exponentially with d. The NRC results for the two simulations, with k = 12 , can be seen in Fig. 5 . It is possible to notice that the heatmap corresponding to the FCM shows better compressions on average. However, using the “perfect” relative compressor, we would expect the NRCs to be as low as possible on the diagonal of the matrix, 5 5 Not exactly the diagonal, because of the second chromosome of the chimpanzee is split into 2a and 2b, making the matrix not a square one. since they represent related chromosomes. The other squares should have higher NRCs, as they have more variation. This is exactly what happens on the xaFCM test (bottom one in Fig. 5). This becomes even more clear when we are comparing the compression along the same sequence, as can be seen in Fig. 6 . 5 Conclusions and future work We have shown that xaFCMs are good candidates to represent models for ECG biometric identification. When compared with FCMs, with the same memory usage, better accuracy ratios are usually obtained, using up to around 3–4 times less time to compute the NRCs (depending on the choice of d). The gains in computational speed increase in the DNA sequence given the higher order of data length. Our experiments show that it is possible to use them for DNA sequence pattern recognition, making them a suitable alternative to the traditional FCMs. These are promising results, and it seems appropriate to infer that the xaFCMs can be suitable to some other applications, specially when the problem of memory usage or testing speed are crucial. For that reason, in the near future, we plan to test them in different applications, where FCMs have proven suitable, like image pattern recognition [1,11,24] and authorship attribution [4].

Nevertheless, although there is a clear potential for emotionally-aware applications, several challenges preclude their wider availability, sometimes resulting from the low translational nature of the research in affective computing methods, and from a lack of straightforward methods for easy integration of emotion in applications. In light of these challenges, we propose a conceptual vision for the consideration of emotion in the scope of multimodal interactive systems, and how it can articulate with research in affective computing. Aligned with this vision, a first instantiation of an affective generic modality is presented, and a proof-of-concept application, enabling multimodal interaction with Spotify, illustrates how the modality can provide emotional context in interactive scenarios.",

The ECG represents the electrical signal that comes from the contraction of the heart muscles, indirectly representing the flow of blood inside the heart, it is known to convey a key that allows biometric identification. Moreover, due to its relationship with the nervous system, it also varies as a function of the emotional state. The use of information-theoretic data models, associated with data compression algorithms, allowed to effectively compare ECG records and infer the person identity, as well as emotional state at the time of data collection. The proposed method does not require ECG wave delineation or alignment, which reduces preprocessing error. The method is divided into three steps: (1) conversion of the real-valued ECG record into a symbolic time-series, using a quantization process; (2) conditional compression of the symbolic representation of the ECG, using the symbolic ECG records stored in the database as reference; (3) identification of the ECG record class, using a 1-NN (nearest neighbor) classifier. We obtained over 98% of accuracy in biometric identification, whereas in emotion recognition we attained over 90%. Therefore, the method adequately identify the person, and his/her emotion.

However, searching for better filtering techniques in order to obtain a signal with better quality and with the maximum relevant information remains an important issue for researchers in this field. Signal processing is largely performed for ECG analysis and interpretation, but this process can be susceptible to error in the delineation phase. In addition, it can lead to the loss of important information that is usually considered as noise and, consequently, discarded from the analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate if the ECG noise allows for the classification of emotions, while using its entropy as an input in a decision tree classifier. We collected the ECG signal from 25 healthy participants while they were presented with videos eliciting negative (fear and disgust) and neutral emotions. The results indicated that the neutral condition showed a perfect identification (100%), whereas the classification of negative emotions indicated good identification performances (60% of sensitivity and 80% of specificity). These results suggest that the entropy of noise contains relevant information that can be useful to improve the analysis of the physiological correlates of emotion.",

However, based on the current literature review, there are no results that evaluate the number of heartbeats needed for personal identification. This information is undoubtedly useful when building a biometric identification system – any system should ask participants to provide data for identification, using the smallest time interval that is possible, for practical reasons. In this paper, we aim at exploring this topic using a measure of similarity based on the Kolmogorov Complexity, called the Normalized Relative Compression (NRC). To attain the goal, we built finite-context models to represent each individual – a compression-based approach that has been shown successful for several other pattern recognition applications like image similarity, DNA sequences or authorship attribution.",

However, that is not always possible. Given that phobias are rather context-specific, their study is the ideal candidate to assess the feasibility of using a mobile and wearable device for obtaining physiological and behavioral data. In this article, we propose BeMonitored, a smartphone-based solution to support more ecologically valid monitoring of psychological experiments. BeMonitored delivers customizable, specific context-dependent audiovisual stimuli and uses external resources connected via Bluetooth or a smartphone’s own resources, while capturing the participant’s behavior, physiology, and environment. We used BeMonitored in a spider phobia case study and showed that spider phobics differed from control participants in face motion, captured by the smartphone camera. Moreover, our results also revealed heart rate differences between spider and neutral stimuli in phobic participants. The presented results emphasize the usefulness of smartphones for phobia monitoring. Considering their intrinsic characteristics, smartphones may constitute the natural evolution from the lab to more realistic contexts.",

These methods are now evaluated under parasympathetic autonomic blockade, i.e. a condition which tends to difficult the modelling task once the RR variability is dramatically decreased whereas no SBP changes are observed. As expected, fuzzy logic models obtained under vagal blockade have lower modelling error than those obtained in baseline. The pairwise differences between errors in both conditions are positively correlated with differences in SBP LF power and in RR HF power, markers of sympathetic and vagal activity respectively. The methyl-atropine surfaces are flatter than those in baseline, in agreement with the decrease in frequency domain BRS estimates from baseline to drug condition. Finally, fuzzy models obtained under vagal blockade were found to be statistically significant, which strengths the potential of the fuzzy logic approach to model SBP and RR also during vagal blockade.",

The basic emotion of disgust, in particular, allows the organism to protect itself against diseases. Usually, the decrease in heart rate is associated with this emotion. As an avoidance behavior, when facing with disgust stimuli, the body reacts with movements, such as muscle contraction, etc. These reactions are evidenced in the electrocardiogram (ECG) as noise responses. In this paper, we propose the amount of ECG noise measured by the noise entropy as a new biomarker in emotion identification, which has been neglected in the literature. Our results showed that the noise entropy was able to discriminate between disgust, fear and neutral conditions in 88% (p<0.05). It was also evidenced in this dataset that the median noise entropy in disgust was higher than in neutral and in fear conditions.",

To accomplish this purpose, AWARE delivers context dependent audio-visual stimuli, embedded into the subject's real-world perception, via marker/vision-based augmented reality (AR) technology. In addition, it employs external measuring resources connected via Bluetooth, as well as the smartphone's integrated resources. It synchronously acquires the experiment's video (camera input with AR overlay), physiologic responses (with a dedicated ECG measuring device) and behavior (through movement and location, with accelerometer/gyroscope and GPS, respectively). Psychological assessment is heavily based on laboratory procedures, even though it is known that these settings disturb the subjects' natural reactions and condition. The major idea of this application is to evaluate the participant condition, mimicking his/her real life conditions. Given that phobias are rather context specific, they represent the ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of a mobile system application. AWARE allowed presenting AR stimuli (e.g., 3D spiders) and quantifying the subjects' reactions non-intrusively (e.g., heart rate variation) - more emphatic in the phobic volunteer when presented with spider vs non phobic stimulus. Although still a proof of concept, AWARE proved to be flexible, and straightforward to setup, with the potential to support ecologically valid monitoring experiments.",

Yet, ECG possesses characteristics that are unique or difficult to get from other signals used in biometrics: (1) it requires contact and liveliness for acquisition (2) it changes under stress, rendering it potentially useless if acquired under threatening. Our main objective is to present an innovative and robust solution to the above-mentioned problem. To successfully conduct this goal, we rely on information-theoretic data models for data compression and on similarity metrics related to the approximation of the Kolmogorov complexity. The proposed measure allows the comparison of two (or more) ECG segments, without having to follow traditional approaches that require heartbeat segmentation (described as highly influenced by external or internal interferences). As a first approach, the method was able to cluster the data in three groups: identical record, same participant, different participant, by the stratification of the proposed measure with values near 0 for the same participant and closer to 1 for different participants. A leave-one-out strategy was implemented in order to identify the participant in the database based on his/her ECG. A 1- NN classifier was implemented, using as distance measure the method proposed in this work. The classifier was able to identify correctly almost all participants, with an accuracy of 99% in the database used.",

Furthermore, these exams are often difficult to interpret due to image quality. Therefore, automatic systems able to analyze echocardiographic quantitative parameters in order to convey useful information will provide a great help in clinical diagnosis. A robust dataset was built, comprising variables associated with left-ventricle dynamics, which were studied in order to build a classifier able to discriminate between pathological and non-pathological records. To accomplish this goal, a network classifier based on decision tree was developed, using as input the left ventricle velocity over a complete cardiac cycle. This classifier revealed both sensitivity and specificity over 90% in discriminating non-pathological records, or pathological records (dilated or hypertrophic).",

Then, 100 ml h-1 (1000 mg h-1) of propofol 1% infusion rate was administered until a deep anaesthetic stage was reached. The infusion rate was temporarily increased to 200 ml h-1 (2000 mg h-1) to achieve 80% of burst suppression.The index performance was accessed by correlation coefficient with the propofol concentrations, and prediction probability with the anaesthetic clinical end-points.

These changes cannot be identified easily in the raw EEG, therefore EEG based indices were adopted for assessing depth of anaesthesia (DoA). This study examines several indices for estimating dogs' DoA. Data (EEG, clinical end-points) were collected from 8 dogs anaesthetized with propofol. EEG was initially collected without propofol. Then, 100 ml h−1 (1000 mg h−1) of propofol 1% infusion rate was administered until a deep anaesthetic stage was reached. The infusion rate was temporarily increased to 200 ml h−1 (2000 mg h−1) to achieve 80% of burst suppression. The index performance was accessed by correlation coefficient with the propofol concentrations, and prediction probability with the anaesthetic clinical end-points. The temporal entropy and the averaged instantaneous frequency were the best indices because they exhibit: (a) strong correlations with propofol concentrations, (b) high probabilities of predicting anaesthesia clinical end-points. Keywords EEG Entropy Instantaneous frequency Depth of anaesthesia Dog 1 Introduction General anaesthesia is characterized by three distinct components: (a) depth of anaesthesia (unconsciousness or hypnosis), (b) analgesia, and (c) muscle relaxation. This study is focused on the depth of anaesthesia (DoA) component. Anaesthesia is brought about by the administration of hypnotic drugs that suppress the central nervous system. It is manifested in the resulting changes of the electrical activity of the patient's brain in the measured electroencephalogram (EEG) signal (Nayak and Roy, 1993). A stable level of DoA is important to guarantee good surgical conditions, safety and fast recovery. To sustain a constant level of DoA it is useful to monitor the EEG of the patient. However, the EEG is known for its nonlinearity and complexity (Thakor and Tong, 2004), which obstruct the analysis and interpretation of this signal with the consistency needed in clinical practice. To deal with this problem, appropriate descriptors derived from the EEG are used instead (Huang et al., 1999). Current DoA descriptors have helped increase patient safety, decrease drug consumption, and help the anaesthesiologist in his/her decisions (Ekman et al., 2004; White et al., 2004). Nevertheless, improving the reliability and accuracy of DoA estimation remains the topic of ongoing research. Some of this research has considered dog EEG in particular, as this provides a more challenging experimentation platform that could potentially lead to the development of more robust analysis methods. Examples include work on classifier-assisted determination of DoA level using a combination of EEG extracted features (Zhang and Roy, 2001), studies on EEG-based measurements of the response to pain stimulus (Nayak and Roy, 1993), and evaluations of the performance of commercial DoA index developed for humans when applied to dogs (Bollen and Saxtorph, 2006; Ribeiro et al., 2008, 2009). Factors as the head anatomy, the EEG frequency band of interest, and the electrode placement, are important for a reliable assessment of the DoA. Commercial anaesthesia indicators (developed for use on humans) exhibit limitations in the DoA evaluation when applied to dogs, since they are applied in a “black-box” sense (e.g. there is no provision for changing settings according to the particular subject). In addition, the physiological meaning of the index's values cannot be unambiguously established (Ferenets et al., 2006). Finally, the analysed band of frequencies is not consistent, and thus, it is still far from being standardized (Brás et al., 2013). The general consensus to date is that the development and validation of DoA descriptors for animals remain an open problem (Brás et al., 2013). In order to obtain a reliable measure of the DoA in clinical operations, a better understanding of the dog's EEG during anaesthesia is needed. Reliable indicators of DoA could ultimately be incorporated into clinical devices and greatly enhance surgical operations in general. Considering the lack of such instrumentation in current veterinary surgical practice, studies like this can provide significant advancements in the quality of anaesthetic procedures in line with animal welfare and safety. In this paper, several EEG based algorithms were tested in order to obtain a reliable index able to measure the dog's DoA level instead of using indices developed for human EEG which may compromise the dog's DoA evaluation. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Animals The dogs involved in this study were part of an adoption programme between local animal societies and the Veterinary Hospital of Porto. Written consent was obtained as appropriate from the institutions involved. Data were collected from eight male dogs submitted to scheduled orchiectomy under general anaesthesia using propofol. The dogs' weights ranged between 11.2 kg and 48 kg (20.9 ± 11.7 kg). 2.2 Data collection Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a propofol 1% solution (Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg, Germany) using a syringe pump (Asena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) designed to allow a maximum infusion rate of 600 ml h−1. The RugLoop II® software was used to drive the propofol syringe pump and store all haemodynamic and propofol infusion rate data. The EEG signal was recorded using the IoC-View Monitor (Morpheus Medical Systems, Barcelona, Spain). To collect the EEG, the applied sensors had to be adapted for animal use, since the human sensor is composed of three single adhesive electrodes. Instead, the wire link button was adapted to alligator clamps, which were then clipped onto the dogs' head skin. This modification was welded, and protected with silicon (Bressan, 2007). The electrodes were placed along the middle line of the dogs' head. The IoC View software was used to collect the EEG. The monitor provided one raw of EEG signal per dog. 2.3 Anaesthetic Protocol Dogs were premedicated with 0.05 mg kg−1 acepromazine IM (Vetoquinol, Univete), thirty minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anaesthesia. Data (EEG, clinical end points and propofol infusion rates) were collected during routine surgical procedures under propofol anaesthesia; no stimuli were applied during the study period. EEG was collected in the first 5 minutes without propofol, to analyse the signal corresponding to the “awake” state. Then, a propofol constant infusion rate of 100 ml h−1 was administered until a deep stage (lost of corneal reflex) (Ribeiro et al., 2009) was achieved. At this point, the propofol infusion rate was increased to 200 ml h−1, until the EEG reached around 80% of burst suppression. Dogs were allowed to breathe on their own, via a facial mask supplying them with 100% oxygen, until intubation was possible. Then, dogs were manually ventilated using a closed circuit to maintain the carbon dioxide (CO2) end-tidal at 35 mmHg. Caution was exercised so that the experiment could immediately be interrupted if hypotension (mean arterial pressure lower than 60 mmHg) was to occur. Data collection for this study stopped at such instances. The analgesic treatment was then performed by the administration of fentanyl in the dose of 5 µg/kg IV before incision. 2.4 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model A pharmacokinetic model is a mathematical model that is used to predict the plasma concentration (Cp) of a drug (Absalom and Struys, 2005). In the case of propofol, a three compartment based model is considered (Absalom and Struys, 2005). The plasma concentration is the amount of drug in compartment 1 (the blood), compartment 2 represents the muscles, and compartment 3, the fat tissues. Equation (13) represents the plasma concentration, describing the movements inside the compartments, where V1 = Vc × weight (Vc is the volume of central compartment per kg, weight denotes the dog's weight in kg, and kij represents the transfer rate between compartment i to compartment j (pharmacokinetic parameters)) (Absalom and Struys, 2005): (13) C p ( s ) = 1 V 1 ⋅ s 2 + ( k 31 + k 21 ) s + k 21 k 31 s 3 + p 1 s 2 + p 2 s + p 3 r ( s ) , p 1 = k 31 + k 21 + k 10 + k 13 + k 12 ​ , p 2 = k 21 k 31 + k 10 k 21 + k 13 k 21 + k 10 k 31 + k 12 k 31 ​ , p 3 = k 10 k 21 k 31 The dog's pharmacokinetic model is described by Beths et al. (2001). Since hypnotics (in this case propofol) exert their effect on the brain, the estimation of the concentration in the target organ is essential. The pharmacodynamic model describes the effect-site concentration (Ce). This assumes that only part of the drug in the blood achieves the target organ. Equation (14) represents the effect-site concentration, where ke0 is the pharmacodynamic parameter that converts Cp into Ce, (14) C e ( s ) = 1 1 k e 0 s + 1 C p ( s ) The above parameter was introduced by Brás et al. (2009) and linked to the Beths Pk model, constituting the dog's propofol pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PkPd) model. 2.5 EEG pre-processing The acquired EEG was sampled at 1024 Hz. The spectrum of the EEG revealed that specific interferences existed at 50 Hz and 64 Hz. These interferences were eliminated by means of a notch filter with a quality factor “Q” equal to 10. Since the EEG band frequency is below 100 Hz (Thakor and Tong, 2004), a Butterworth low pass filter of order 15 and cut-off frequency at 100 Hz was used to remove unwanted noisy components. In order to describe the time-varying phenomenon of anaesthesia, the EEG signal was first segmented into consecutive, non-overlapping short-time windows. The window size in this study was equal to 1 second (or 1024 samples). Each epoch was then analysed by the different methods described in Section 2, to obtain the time courses of the different descriptors of the anaesthesia process. 2.6 Anaesthetic clinical end points To evaluate the performance of the different indices, a clinical measure of the dog's state is also needed. It is possible to describe the clinical end point of the dog's anaesthesia by evaluating the eye reflexes (Ribeiro et al., 2009). The palpebral and corneal reflexes were tested with a swab moistened in physiological saline solution. Each reflex was tested three times and was considered negative if there was no response at any of the three prompts. For the palpebral reflex test, the swab touched gently the lateral eye corner, whereas a smooth pressure was applied on the cornea for the corneal reflex test. Consequently, the DoA was classified between Plane A (low DoA) and Plane E (deep DoA) (for detailed clinical description please refer to Ribeiro et al., 2009). Clinical end points were based in combinations of responses from three tests: 1) the palpebral reflex, 2) the corneal reflex, and 3) observing the eye ball position. Since the palpebral reflex was tested at the lateral eye corner, the loss of palpebral reflex did not mean that the surgical plane of anaesthesia was achieved. Table 1 describes each plane and only when the dog reached plane D, was the surgical stage achieved. In human anaesthesia, the anaesthetic indices usually vary between 0 and 100, where 0 corresponds to an isoelectric EEG, and 100 represents a “fully awake” EEG. Such ranges are used to facilitate the clinical interpretation of the index, where the index values have clinical meaning. Knowing the clinical meaning of each anaesthetic plane, we propose the association between the anaesthetic clinical end points and the numerical scale, as represented in Fig. 1 . 2.7 Index evaluation The Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was calculated between propofol concentrations and each index, measuring their relation. The drug infusion causes alterations on the EEG that should be noticed in the index. The syringe pump sampling frequency is 10 seconds, so for possible analysis of the relation between the indices and the drug concentrations, the indices are post-processed by a causal moving average filter over non-overlapping windows of 10 points (corresponding to 10 seconds). The filter formula is presented in Equation (15). (15) s m o o t h e d _ i n d e x ( n ) = 1 10 ∑ i = 10 * n − 10 10 * n − 1 i n d e x ( i ) ; n = 1 , 2 , … To evaluate the ability of each index to accurately represent the DoA, the obtained indices were compared with the anaesthetic clinical end points using the prediction probability (Pp) as described by Smith et al. (1996). Considering Pc, Pd , and Ptx probabilities of two random data points, independent and with replacement, from: a concordance, a discordance or an x-only tie population (Smith et al., 1996), the prediction probability is defined in Equation (16) (Smith et al., 1996). Pp varies between 0 indicating no match between the indicator and the anaesthetic depth, and 1 corresponding to a perfect match. (16) P p = P c + 1 2 P t x P c + P d + P t x A chi-squared test was implemented in order to verify if there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the correlation coefficients. 2.8 EEG-based DoA descriptors Several EEG-based indices that have been proposed in the literature have also been studied here. These are reviewed along with more recent approaches, and comprehensive comparisons are made regarding their potential to provide suitable DoA descriptors. In particular, the following algorithms have been considered: 1. Frequency domain measures: spectral edge frequency, spectral entropy and relative power-based index; 2. Time domain measures: temporal entropy, permutation entropy; 3. Joint time–frequency domain measure: averaged instantaneous frequency. 2.8.1 Spectral edge frequency (SEF) The SEF is defined as the frequency below which x% of the signal power exists (Doyle et al., 2007). Suppose that TP is the total power, PSEF is x% of the total power, w is the signal frequencies vector, and i P S E F is the index of w where x% of the total power is verified, the SEF is calculated by Equation (1), (1) P S E F = x % × T P S E F = w ( i P S E F ) In this study, SEF is evaluated at 95%, 90% and 50% of the signal power (Doyle et al., 2007; Jospin et al., 2007; Otto, 2007) (the latter also known as median frequency). 2.8.2 Temporal entropy (TE) The TE calculates the entropy directly from the EEG time-series (Thakor and Tong, 2004). The EEG signal is characterized by its disorder and nonlinearity, although the signal becomes less disordered in line with the increase of DoA. Therefore, the entropy measure could capture the signal's alterations, characterizing the anaesthetic state of the patient. The amplitude range W is divided in M disjoint and consecutive intervals Ii Equation (2). Then, the probability distribution is estimated as the number of samples (Ni ) in each interval Ii divided by the total number of samples N in each EEG Window Equation (3). The entropy definition is presented in Equation (4), where log represents the natural logarithm, (2) W = ∪ i = 1 M I i (3) p i = N i N (4) T E = − ∑ i = 1 M p i log ( p i ) 2.8.3 Spectral entropy (SE) The SE, as the name indicates, measures the order/disorder of the spectrum of the EEG signal. The entropy is calculated between a pre-defined frequency range [f1, f2]. The power spectrum, given by Equation (5), is normalized by the constant Cn , so that the sum of the power spectrum in the above frequency range equals to one (6). Equation (7) provides the entropy, where log represents the natural logarithm. The calculated entropy is subsequently normalized, dividing by the total number N[f1, f2] of the frequency components in the range [f1, f2] Equation (8), as described in Viertio-Oja et al. (2004). (5) P ( f i ) = X ( f i ) X * ( f i ) (6) ∑ f i = f 1 f 2 P n ( f i ) = C n ∑ f i = f 1 f 2 P ( f i ) = 1 (7) S [ f 1 ​ , f 2 ] = ∑ f i = f 1 f 2 P n ( f i ) log ( 1 P n ( f i ) ) (8) S E [ f 1 ​ , f 2 ] = S [ f 1 ​ , f 2 ] log ( N [ f 1 ​ , f 2 ] ) 2.8.4 Permutation entropy (PE) The PE is used to explore existing patterns within the time series (Bandt and Pompe, 2002). These elemental patterns are called motifs, and the signal is seen as a sequence of motifs, being characterized by: • the order, corresponding to the number of points in each motif (motif pattern consists of three points); • the lag (τ), the number of sample points spanned by each section of the motif (τ = 1 or τ = 2 data points within each part of the motif); • the noise threshold (tie < 0.5 µV, Olofsen et al., 2008). Seven different types of motifs are described in Olofsen et al. (2008): the initial six types (Equation (9)), plus the new pattern defined by the noise threshold (i.e. the motifs where the voltage difference between any two points is lower than 0.5 µV). (9) { x 1 < x 2 ∩ x 1 > x 3 x 1 > x 2 > x 3 x 1 > x 2 ∩ x 1 > x 3 ∩ x 2 < x 3 x 1 > x 2 ∩ x 1 < x 3 x 1 < x 2 < x 3 x 1 < x 2 ∩ x 1 < x 3 ∩ x 2 > x 3 The PE algorithm is described as follows: • the EEG is segmented in a sequence of motifs; • each segment is identified in one of the seven possible types; • the number of classified segments is counted for each type of motif so as to calculate the probability of each motif in the signal (pi); • as indicated by Olofsen et al. (2008), the combination between PEtie < 0.5,τ = 1 and PEtie < 0.5,τ = 2 is the best measure to evaluate DoA (Equation (10)). (10) P E = − ∑ p i log ( p i ) t i e < 0.5 , τ = 1 + ∑ p i log ( p i ) t i e < 0.5 , τ = 2 log ( 49 ) 2.8.5 Averaged instantaneous frequency (AIF) The AIF within the window [ta, tb] is given by Equation (11), where ωi(t) is the instantaneous frequency defined as the first derivative of the signal's phase ϕ(t) (Georgakis et al., 2003). (11) A I F = 1 t b − t a ∫ t a t b ω i ( t ) d t ω i ( t ) = d ϕ ( t ) d t The phase in real signals is calculated by means of the analytic signal z ( t ) = s ( t ) + j H [ s ( t ) ] , where s(t) is the real signal and H[s(t)] is its Hilbert transform. The requirement to average in Equation (11) is a consequence of the fact that the EEG is a random signal. The AIF algorithm was implemented as follows: • the EEG is transformed into its corresponding analytic signal (z(t)); • the instantaneous phase is calculated by ϕ ( t ) = arctan ( H [ s ( t ) ] s ( t ) ) ; • the instantaneous frequency is estimated as the first derivative of the unwrapped phase via first-order finite differences; • the instantaneous frequency values are then averaged over each window to provide the required AIF values. 2.8.6 Relative power-based index (RPI) The relative power quantifies the proportion of power in a certain frequency band, over the total power. Anaesthesia could be divided into five EEG characteristic waves that are classified by distinct frequency bands, representing different anaesthesia states (delta – 0.5–4 Hz, theta – 4–8 Hz, alpha – 8–12 Hz, beta – 12–30 Hz, and gamma >40 Hz, Lake, 1994). The relative power in each one of the five characteristic waves quantifies the proportion of a certain anaesthesia state. Thus, the combination of all five relative powers in each epoch (EEG segment, in that study corresponding to 1024 samples) may provide a fuller characterization of the patient's state. In this work, principal components analysis (Anderson, 1984) was performed between the five relative powers (RPs) to obtain a new index called RPI. The principal component (PC) is defined as a linear combination between random processes with certain variance characteristics (Anderson, 1984). The variance of each component characterizes its statistical properties (Anderson, 1984). This method transforms the data in a new coordinate system. A reduction in the number of variables is the goal of this method; consequently the linear combinations with small variance are discarded (Anderson, 1984). The first PC explains the maximum data variance. Assuming a random vector X with p components, Σ is the covariance matrix and µ is the expected vector assumed to be zero. The eigenvectors matrix of Σ is Φ and Λ is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, ΣΦ = ΦΛ and Φ'Φ = Id. The PCs are defined as Y = Φ'X, where Y = (Y1,Y2,…, Yp) and Φ = (Φ1, Φ2,…, Φp). The data X are represented in a new axes system by Y, and the new variables are uncorrelated, due to the covariance matrix being diagonal. The eigenvalues are the variances of the new variables. In the presentation of this index only training data (from the 8 dogs) were considered, since our main goal is to understand which indices may better describe the dogs' DoA. The RPI is developed according to the following method: 1. The five RP data are normalized (mean 0 and standard deviation 1) (the X); 2. The number of principal components (PCs) that described more than 90% of the data variance was determined. The five PCs were ordered in terms of decreasing variance. The first PC corresponds to the PC with the highest variance (i.e. maximum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix). The presented variance of each PC was calculated as the relative variance over the total data variance; 3. Based on the 8 dogs' data it was concluded that the first three PCs describe more than 90% of the data variance, therefore data information is preserved in a reduced dimension. The three PCs correspond to three different linear combinations of the five RPs; 4. RPI was determined by the linear combination of the three PCs; RPI = a1PC1 + a2PC2 + a3PC3, where ai assumes the values ±1. The same weight was assigned for each PC to preserve its characteristics; 5. Due to the better correlation between RPI and the propofol Cp and Ce and to the negative correlation that should be observed, the best linear combination is given by the factors: a1 = 1, a2 = 1 and a3 = 1. The RPI is given by Equation (12), where the coefficients correspond to the three eigenvectors associated with the three highest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which represent more than 90% of the data variance. (12) R P I ( t ) = + 1 * ( − 0.530 R P d e l t a ( t ) − 0.395 R P t h e t a ( t ) − 0.198 R P a l f a ( t ) + 0.453 R P b e t a ( t ) + 0.564 R P g a m m a ( t ) ) + + 1 * ( 0.383 R P d e l t a ( t ) − 0.467 R P t h e t a ( t ) − 0.695 R P a l f a ( t ) − 0.379 R P b e t a ( t ) + 0.094 R P g a m m a ( t ) ) + + 1 * ( − 0.280 R P d e l t a ( t ) + 0.559 R P t h e t a ( t ) − 0.154 R P a l f a ( t ) − 0.559 R P b e t a ( t ) + 0.524 R P g a m m a ( t ) ) 2.9 Index rescaling The developed indices vary in different scales. For an easiest interpretation and comparison between them, normalization between 0 and 100 was needed. A 0–100 scale allows for easy index evaluation (Viertio-Oja et al., 2004). In Fig. 1, a possible relation between the anaesthetic clinical end points and a numerical scale is demonstrated. In the operating room a straightforward index is preferred; e.g., commercial DoA indices for humans usually vary within an easy-to-read range between 0 and 100 (Viertio-Oja et al., 2004). Viertio-Oja et al. (2004) have suggested a cubic spline transformation between a unitary scale index and an index varying between 0 and 100. For dogs, a cubic spline is developed too in this work. To rescale the dog's DoA index the following steps have been followed: 1. Each index was normalized between 0 and 1; 2. A cubic spline was generated, based on the anaesthetic clinical end point relation. That was the mean value found in each anaesthetic clinical end point (between 0 and 1) that matched the mean value of the same clinical state represented in Fig. 1; 3. After converting the index between 0 and 1, the index was recalculated according to the described spline (Fig. 2 , spline developed for TE application). 3 Results Table 2 presents the Pearson correlation coefficient calculated between each index (table lines) and the propofol Cp and Ce, in each dog data (table columns). Values higher (in modulus) than 0.5 describe a linear relation between the two variables. A negative value indicates that the variables are inversely proportional, which is expected between propofol Cp/Ce and EEG derived indices, because when the drug concentration increases the EEG activity decreases conducing to a DoA level increase. Almost all evaluations revealed correlation values higher than 0.5 (in modulus). However, there are indices that reveal better results across all dogs. In this study, the better indices were chosen based on the evaluation of each dog data. A statistical significance test (chi square test, p < 0.05) was employed to determine which of the eight implemented indices exhibited higher correlation (in modulus) than the others. It was verified that the temporal entropy (TE) and the averaged instantaneous frequency (AIF) were the best indices in the description of DoA level across all dogs. The Pp evaluates the clinical relevance of each index (Table 3 ), studying the association between the indices (table lines) and each dog (table column) clinical end points. Values near 1 represent a perfect description of the end-points by the index. Temporal entropy revealed the index globally with better results, being the best index in four dogs' data, considering the evaluation of the highest Pp value by dog. The presented indices vary between different scales and values, therefore to allow proper comparison between them, a transformation spline was computed and applied to each index. The spline was computed based on each index's own characteristics, i.e. using its normalized values (between 0 and 1) and matching the standard hypnotic scale in Fig. 1, using the index classification by the clinical end points. The illustrations of two dogs' data, after application of the cubic spline (Fig. 2), are presented in Fig. 3 . In the data of Dog 5 (Fig. 3a), there is a high variability in the last interval (burst suppression interval). The data from Dog 8 (Fig. 3b) represent a typical trend, with a peak verified around 1600 seconds (at which point the monitor starts testing the electrodes and their impedances causing interferences). 4 Discussion and conclusions The goal of this study was to propose a suitable EEG based depth of anaesthesia indicator for dogs. Usually, commercial monitors developed for humans are used on veterinary practice; however, there are problems due to the relevant physiological differences between the two species (Brás et al., 2013). The relation between drug concentrations and hypnotic indices is inversely proportional, i.e. described by a negative correlation, since the drug increase is followed by a decrease in EEG activity and higher levels of DoA. The SEF index describes the brain effect at induction decreasing its values (the induction phase is the most powerful phase during anaesthesia in terms of depression of cerebral activity). The SEF95 and SEF90 have higher correlation than SEF50 with the propofol Cp and Ce. The TE was developed using 100 amplitude levels (M = 100, it is intended to have in limit 10/11 points per I level, since the index is calculated in each second of data – 1024 samples), varying between 0 (points concentrated in one level) and 4.691 (points uniformly distributed over the 100 levels). Considering previous studies reporting this index application on human EEG (Bruhn et al., 2001; Ferenets et al., 2006), it was observed that the TE increases with the DoA increase. However, in our study the TE decreased during induction and with the increase of the DoA. Since TE evaluates the distribution of EEG amplitude values, there may be two main reasons justifying this difference: (a) the analysed frequency band is different (as already observed in our previous study Brás et al., 2013); (b) the EEG signal characteristics are different from the human's. This finding in fact reinforces the need to study new or adapted measures in the dog's DoA evaluation. The correlation between the index and drug concentrations, and the prediction probability between the index values and the anaesthetic clinical end points were significant (Tables 2 and 3). The SE analyses the entropy of the power spectrum in the frequency interval [0, 47] Hz. SE has a poor performance compared with TE (Tables 2 and 3). The PE does not react to the induction, but it follows the increase of DoA. The correlation between Cp/Ce and the index is significant in almost all dogs' data, but in modulus it is around 0.5 (meaning moderate correlation). The prediction probability is higher than 0.5 in half of the data. The AIF follows the expected trend of the DoA indices: it decreases its value with the increase of the DoA and drug concentration. Except for the data from Dog 2, the correlation between the index and the Cp/Ce is significant. The prediction probability between the index and the anaesthetic clinical end points is higher than 0.7 for all dogs' data (Tables 2 and 3). An additional advantage of this method may be that it is robust to the choice of the analysis window size. The RPI has a good performance in the prediction of DoA. It is verified that the increase of the DoA is associated with the decrease of the index values. Analysing Dog 1 data, it is verified that the highest Pp and correlations with Cp/Ce are observed using this index, indicating a good index accuracy (within statistical analysis). The Ce is the amount of drug that produces real effect, so this concentration by definition should be more related to brain indices than the Cp. The Ce is calculated knowing the ke0 . This ke0 was developed with the Cerebral State Index (CSI) as a measure of effect (Brás et al., 2009). This fact could explain the presence of certain correlation values in the Ce lower than that calculated for the Cp (Table 2). A new ke0 should be calculated with the chosen index, in order to obtain a secure and safest use of Ce in dogs' anaesthesia, according to the used index. The present study was performed as an initial investigation on a small sample. Further and more rigorous laboratory study is needed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed indices in the clinical environment. Also, it is yet to be determined which of the two proposed indices (TE and AIF) can better meet the anaesthetic needs in actual veterinary surgical practice. This study intends to guide the DoA study in dogs by indicating two well-performing descriptors for potential use for dogs' anaesthesia level evaluation. A number of indices were implemented and compared in order to establish the ones that could better describe the DoA in dogs. It was found that the temporal entropy (TE) and the averaged instantaneous frequency (AIF) could accurately represent the different stages of anaesthesia in dogs, with the TE exhibiting a marginally better performance. In addition, a standardized numerical scale was proposed, whose numerical index maps onto the dogs' DoA level, offering an easy assessment of the DoA level.

The controller was tested using constant and variable references in an exhaustive set of simulations. The controller developed presents a good performance in all simulations and the controlled variable seems to be influenced by electromyography level.

        "doc_abstract": "Heart rate and blood pressure are the most important vital signs in diagnosing disease. Both heart rate and blood pressure are characterized by a high degree of short term variability from moment to moment, medium term over the normal day and night as well as in the very long term over months to years. The study of new mathematical algorithms to evaluate the variability of these cardiovascular parameters has a high potential in the development of new methods for early detection of cardiovascular disease, to establish differential diagnosis with possible therapeutic consequences. The autonomic nervous system is a major player in the general adaptive reaction to stress and disease. The quantitative prediction of the autonomic interactions in multiple control loops pathways of cardiovascular system is directly applicable to clinical situations. Exploration of new multimodal analytical techniques for the variability of cardiovascular system may detect new approaches for deterministic parameter identification. A multimodal analysis of cardiovascular signals can be studied by evaluating their amplitudes, phases, time domain patterns, and sensitivity to imposed stimuli, i.e., drugs blocking the autonomic system. The causal effects, gains, and dynamic relationships may be studied through dynamical fuzzy logic models, such as the discrete-time model and discrete-event model. We expect an increase in accuracy of modeling and a better estimation of the heart rate and blood pressure time series, which could be of benefit for intelligent patient monitoring. We foresee that identifying quantitative mathematical biomarkers for autonomic nervous system will allow individual therapy adjustments to aim at the most favorable sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. © 2013 Campos, Pereira, Muralikrishna, Albarwani, Brás and Gouveia.",

The well-known Cerebral State Index (CSI) quantifies depth of anesthesia and is traditionally modeled with Hill equation and propofol effect-site concentration (Ce). This work brings out two novelties: introduction of electromyogram (EMG) and use of fuzzy logic models with ANFIS optimized parameters. The data were collected from dogs (n =27) during routine surgery considering two propofol administration protocols: constant infusion (G1, n =14) and bolus (G2, n =13). The median modeling error of the fuzzy logic model with Ce and EMG was lower or similar than that of the Hill with Ce (p =0.012-G1, p =0.522-G2). Furthermore, there was no significant performance impact due to model structure alteration (p =0.288-G1, p =0.330-G2) and EMG introduction increased or maintained the performance (p =0.036-G1, p =0.798-G2). Therefore, the new model can achieve higher performance than Hill model, mostly due to EMG information and not due to changes in the model structure. In conclusion, the fuzzy models adequately describe CSI data with advantages over traditional Hill models. Keywords Depth of anesthesia CSI EMG Dog Fuzzy logic model Hill equation 1 Introduction The increasing complexity of surgical procedures calls for more advanced anesthetic techniques (Barash et al., 2009). While considerable advances have been made in human anesthesia techniques, the same cannot be said about veterinary anesthesia. As a matter of fact, the techniques used for humans are currently adapted for animal use, e.g., the automatic evaluation of depth of anesthesia (DoA). Nevertheless, the need for support/automatic systems to monitor and induce a stable DoA assume a high importance in veterinary practice, which would yield significant improvements in patients’ welfare under general anesthesia, diminishing side effects. A DoA monitor provides a useful and friendly display of the patient’s anesthesia level, allowing a proper adjustment of hypnotic drug needs to balance the drug-effect relation. Since increased DoA is associated with decreased brain electrical activity, several electroencephalogram (EEG) derived indexes for monitoring DoA have been developed for humans (White et al., 2004; Ekman et al., 2004; Iannuzzi et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2005). As an example, the Cerebral State Index (CSI) has shown promising results with dogs’ data, as reported by Bollen and Saxtorph (2006) and Ribeiro et al. (2008). The validation of a DoA index can be carried out with mathematical models that estimate it as a function of physiological variables. The CSI is traditionally modeled using the Hill equation, which takes into account the effect-site concentration (Ce), which briefly is the concentration of hypnotics in the brain, and reflects its effect on brain electric activity. The CSI monitor acquires an electric activity signal using facial electrodes, and makes use of band pass filters to obtain the EEG and the electromyography (EMG) (Danmeter A/S, 2006). During surgery, the EEG exhibits typically lower frequencies than EMG. Nevertheless, since EEG and EMG frequency bands are overlapped above approximately 30Hz (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007), it is likely that the EMG acquired by the CSI monitor contain EEG information of high frequencies, as reported by Jensen et al. (2006): “It cannot be ruled out that the CSI has some influence of facialis electromyography”. This work presents a novel model to describe the CSI as a function of Ce and EMG, with application in dogs’ data. While Ce and EMG are related, there is no established mathematical model relationship between them. In this framework, fuzzy logic methods have been used to describe the unknown input–output relationship, combining both empirical rules and information extracted from the experimental data itself (Kovacic and Bogdan, 2006). Additionally, the fact that the system under study is highly variable, due to patients’ different reactions to similar stimulus, justifies the use of fuzzy models that weighs rules and permits a grey zone (not only “1” or “0”) allowing a better modeling of overall patient reaction (Kovacic and Bogdan, 2006). Fuzzy methods are easy to interpret as the model output can be written as a weighted linear combination of the system inputs, and constitute a generic framework for uncertainty handling. These methods have multiple applications (Kovacic and Bogdan, 2006), e.g., a fuzzy model had already been presented for analgesia score evaluation, relating the propofol and remifentanil concentrations with different DoA indices (Gambús et al., 2011). Although hypnotics like propofol are not muscle relaxants, they usually induce alterations in muscle activity (Ribeiro et al., 2008) reflected as a decrease in the EMG. Thus, it is important to study the hypothesis of enhancing CSI modeling by taking into account the EMG information together with the Ce. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Clinical data Data were collected from 27 dogs during routine surgery (orchiectomy or ovariectomy) with general anesthesia using propofol. The dogs were mixed breed, housed at Hospital Veterinário do Porto following standard pre-intervention conditions. The collected data were divided in two groups: G1 was used to develop the model (i.e., parameters estimation and validation), whereas G2 was used to test the model. The local ethics committee approved the procedures and an informed consent was provided to the owner. 2.1.1 Hemodynamic monitoring The propofol and fluid administration (sodium chloride 0.9%) were performed by a three way stopcock catheterized in the cephalic vein. An infusion pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was used for the sodium chloride 0.9% administration at a constant infusion rate of 10mlkg−1 h−1 during all the study period. The hemodynamic state of the patient was monitored, during all the anesthesia procedure, using a S/5 Datex anesthesia monitor (S/5 Datex-Ohmeda; Helsinki, Finland), namely monitoring blood pressure, lead II ECG and heart rate. Blood pressure was measured non-invasively on the posterior left foot using repeated measurements (oscillometric method): each measurement was done immediately after the preceding one (Datex S/5 “STAT” mode). 2.1.2 Data acquisition During each intervention, simultaneous measurements of propofol infusion rate r(t), CSI(t), and EMG(t) were recorded on a 5s time basis. Fig. 1 shows that an increase in the propofol infusion rate, r(t), produces an increase in Ce(t) and a simultaneous decrease in both CSI(t) and EMG(t), which is in accordance with propofol physiological effect. Propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg, Germany) was administered using a syringe pump (Asena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) programmed to allow an infusion rate r ⩽600mlh−1. RugLoop II® software was used to drive the syringe pump and store the data acquired by the Cerebral State Monitor® (CSM, Danmeter A/S). The CSM sensors are three single adhesives electrodes that were adapted for animal use. The wire link button was adapted to alligator’s clamps, which were then clipped to the dog’s head skin, over the head middle line (positive electrode placed in the frontopolar, negative electrode in the occipital and the reference electrode was placed in the pariental). This assembly was welded and protected with silicon (Bressan et al., 2007). The electrodes had impedance levels lower than 5kΩ, following manufacturer recommendations (Danmeter A/S, 2006). The CSI and EMG are simultaneously acquired by the CSM monitor using the same sensors. The monitor collects an electrical signal from the head and makes use of digital filtering to obtain two signals: the EEG (6–42Hz) and the EMG (75–85Hz). The CSI index is calculated using a multiparametric method based on fuzzy logic and EEG frequency parameters (Danmeter A/S, 2006; Jensen et al., 2006). The numerical scale of CSI ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no brain electrical activity and 100 corresponds to awake. The EMG is displayed as a numerical percentage (0–100 logarithmic), corresponding to the percentage of energy acquired in the 75–85Hz frequency band (Danmeter A/S, 2006). 2.1.3 Group 1 – train dataset Group 1 (G1) included 14 male animals, weighting between 18.8 and 35.0kg (25.3±5.3kg). The animals were premedicated 30min prior to the beginning of anesthesia to avoid animal stress (0.05mgkg−1 acepromazine IM, Vetoquinol, Univete). The anesthesia was divided into study and surgical periods: the study period did not have any external interference and was divided into induction and maintenance phases; the surgical period was characterized by external stimulus (e.g., incision, suture) and other drug administration (e.g., analgesic). In the induction phase, propofol was continuously administered at an infusion rate of 200mlh−1 until loss of corneal reflex (clinical criteria to determine a deep DoA). At this point, the dogs were intubated and mechanically ventilated with 100% oxygen in order to maintain an end-tidal CO2 between 35 and 45mmHg. In the maintenance phase, the propofol infusion rate was automatically adjusted so that Cp decreased to 3μgml−1 and after stepwise increased from 4 to 11μgml−1 (4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11μgml−1). The Cp was maintained during 5min in each step and the corneal reflex was evaluated. Hemodynamic variables (non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate and lead II ECG) were monitored during all the study. The surgical period began when corneal reflex was no longer present or hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure below 60mmHg) was verified, at this time a fentanyl bolus (5μgml−1) was administered. During this period, the propofol was adjusted based on clinical needs, i.e., the anesthesiologist evaluated the patient state by the monitor parameters and adjusted the drug concentrations accordingly. When the surgery finished, carprofen 4mgkg−1 SC and a single dose of morphine 0.4mgkg−1 SC were administered to the dogs, being monitored in the post-operative phase. 2.1.4 Group 2 – test dataset Group 2 (G2) was composed of 13 animals (9 female and 5 male), weighting between 6 and 45kg (20.0±11.7kg). The animals were premedicated 30min prior to the beginning of anesthesia to avoid animal stress (0.03mgkg−1 acepromazine IM, Vetoquinol, Univete and 0.5mgkg−1 morphine sulfate, Martindale Pharmaceuticals). In this protocol, the anesthesia was also divided into study and surgical periods. In the study period, propofol was administered via 6mgkg−1 bolus. After bolus administration, CSI was monitored until its minimum value being reached and return to a maximum value around 70 (scale 0–100) in order to avoid complete anesthetic recovery. At this time point, the normal surgical procedure began and depth of anesthesia was increased. During this period, propofol was adjusted based on clinical necessity, in order to maintain the patient stable during the entire procedure. During the study period, dogs were allowed to breath spontaneously via a facial mask connected to a breathing system, where 100% oxygen was administered. Hemodynamic variables (non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate and lead II ECG) were monitored during all study. A similar post-operative protocol was considered for the patients of this group. 2.2 CSI modeling The relation between the infusion rate r and the CSI (measure of effect) is represented in Fig. 2 . The model includes pharmacokinetic (Pk) and pharmacodynamic (Pd) blocks of propofol, and effect block model. After drug administration, the plasma concentration Cp is estimated with the Pk model, and the effect-site concentration Ce is estimated with the Pd model. Finally, the estimated Ce is the input of the effect model that describes CSI. Following sections detail each one of the model blocks. 2.2.1 Estimation of effect-site concentration (Ce) Ce is estimated assuming a Pk/Pd model, which translates what the body does to the drug (Pk) and what the drug does to the body (Pd) (Absalom and Struys, 2005). The Pk model is used to estimate Cp from infusion rate r (mlh−1) and the blood volume V 1 (ml), assuming a conventional three-compartmental model (Absalom and Struys, 2005). After its administration to the blood (compartment 1), the drug is rapidly distributed into the muscular tissues (compartment 2) and slowly distributed into the body fat tissues (compartment 3). These properties can be modeled by (1) Cp ( s ) = 1 V 1 · s 2 + ( k 31 + k 21 ) s + k 21 k 31 s 3 + p 1 s 2 + p 2 s + p 3 r ( s ) , p 1 = k 31 + k 21 + k 10 + k 13 + k 12 , p 2 = k 21 k 31 + k 10 k 21 + k 13 k 21 + k 10 k 31 + k 12 k 31 , p 3 = k 10 k 21 k 31 , where kij (min−1) is the transfer rate between the compartments i and j (i,j =1,2,3, i ≠ j). The parameter k 10 (min−1) is the elimination rate from the blood. The parameter V 1 (V 1 = Vc*wt) represents the blood volume, where Vc is the volume of central compartment per kg and wt is the dog’s weight in kg. In this work, the parameters in Eq. (1) are set to Vc =780mlkg−1, k 10 =0.07min−1, k 12 =0.0365min−1, k 21 =0.0312min−1, k 13 =0.0049min−1, and k 31 =0.0011min−1, following the study of Beths et al. (2001). The Pd model is used to estimate Ce from Cp as (2) Ce ( s ) = 1 1 k e 0 s + 1 Cp ( s ) , where ke 0 (min−1) is the elimination rate of the drug at the effect compartment and represents the delay between Cp and Ce. In this work, ke 0 =0.7230min−1 as detailed in Brás et al. (2009). Briefly, this parameter was estimated using the Time-to-Peak method, i.e., calculating the ke 0 based on the average time between the beginning of the bolus and the maximum CSI effect. 2.2.2 CSI modeling with the Hill equation (sigmoid) The Hill model, that allows to estimate CSI from Ce, is given by (3) CSI ^ t = CSI 0 + ( CSI 0 - CSI max ) Ce t γ Ce t γ + EC 50 γ , where CSImax is the CSI at maximum drug effect (i.e., the minimum CSI value), CSI0 is the CSI at no drug, EC50 is the effect-site concentration that produces 50% of the maximum effect, and γ is the Hill parameter that represents the steepness of drug effect around 50%. For each dog’s data, the Hill equation parameters were identified using nonlinear least squares (De Smet et al., 2007). The average parameters were used in a fixed parameter model. 2.2.3 CSI modeling with fuzzy logic In this work, the model output is z =CSI, while the inputs are x 1 = EMG and x 2 = Ce (see Fig. 2). Considering a Sugeno fuzzy logic model given two inputs x 1 and x 2, a typical fuzzy rule i (i =1,2, …, N) has the form: If x 1 ∈ Fi (x 1) and x 2 ∈ Fi (x 2),then output is (4) z i = a i x 1 + b i x 2 + c i , where F 1 i (x 1) and F 2 i (x 2) are the fuzzy sets and ai , bi , ci are constants. The zi of each rule is weighted by the firing strength wi of the rule i, and j refers to the inputs (in this case n =2 inputs), (5) w i = ∏ j = 1 n Γ F j i x j , where Γ F j i is a Gaussian membership function defined by its center μi and standard deviation σi (Angelov, 2002). The final output of the system z ˆ is the weighted average of all zi , computed as (6) z ˆ = ∑ i = 1 N w i z i ∑ i = 1 N w i , The parameters of the model (a, b, c, μ, σ) for each rule (i) were estimated using Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), combined with backpropagation and least squares minimization (hybrid method) (Jang, 1993). In this work, the initial μ and σ estimates could be obtained either from grid partition or subtractive clustering. In the grid partition method, the domain of the antecedent variables is divided into equidistant and identically shaped membership functions. In the subtractive clustering method, the antecedent domain is divided in clusters that identify conveniently the dataset. In this method, the radius σ is defined a priori as a value between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to the data range (Chiu, 1997). The initial radius σ is chosen from the set {0, 0.05, …, 1} as the radius that allows to obtain the highest performance after ANFIS procedure. 2.3 Statistical analysis The performance of the models is evaluated in terms of the mean absolute error and median bias for each record. The error is obtained from (7) error = 1 m ∑ t = 1 m | CSI ( t ) - CSI ( t ) ^ | , where m is the length of CSI in a recording, CSI ^ is the estimate of CSI as provided by a model, and t denotes time. The bias is obtained as (8) mbias = median ( CSI ( t ) - CSI ( t ) ^ ) , In this work, the model error was also studied regarding dispersion measures of Ce and EMG. For each record, the standard deviation of Ce was evaluated. The measure of EMG dispersion considered only the EMG values above 40%, i.e., (9) std 40 = 1 k - 1 ∑ t = 1 m I ( EMG ( t ) > 40 ) ( EMG ( t ) - 0 ) 2 . where I(A) is the indicator function of the set A and k is the number of EMG values expressing high activity, typically above 40%, in the recording of length m. The statistical analysis was carried out using nonparametric ANOVA, with significance level p <0.05 (Kruskal–Wallis for independent samples and Wilcoxon signed-rank for paired samples). The Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. 3 Results The parameters of the models were identified in the study period of G1 protocol, and validated in the study period of G2 protocol. Validation in a different group than the one used for model identification has the purpose of evaluating the model sensitivity to different anesthetic protocols. Additionally, the models are compared in the surgical period of G1 and G2 protocols, thus testing the models in a different surgery phase. The parameters of the Hill equation were identified using the methods described in Section 2.2.2 and data from the G1 study period. The resulting average parameters were EC50 =6.62±3.70μgml−1, γ =2.00±0.00, CSI0 =99.00±0.00 and CSImax =3.02±7.52 (being in accordance with previously reported results (De Smet et al., 2007)). The parameter CSImax, i.e., the CSI value at maximum drug effect, exhibited a large standard deviation, which evidences the large variability of individual responses to the same experimental protocol. As presented in Table 1 , the fuzzy logic structure that presented the lowest modeling error considered subtractive clustering and 4 rules, corresponding to 4 membership functions. Still, there were no significant differences between the fuzzy logic models for the different structures. After the ANFIS procedure, the model rules are defined as a linear combination between EMG and Ce. The model parameters are given in Table 2 and its corresponding membership functions are presented in Fig. 3 . As an example, the first rule is defined using Eq. (4) and the parameters in Table 2 as z 1 = 0.805 EMG + 2.198 Ce + 5.445 . The rule is then weighted according to Eq. (5) by w 1 = Γ F EMG 1 ( EMG ) × Γ F Ce 1 ( Ce ) , where Γ F EMG 1 is a Gaussian density with μ 1 =83.001 and σ 1 =25.228, and Γ F Ce 1 is a Gaussian density with μ 1 = 4.162 and σ 1 =4.303. The final output CSI ^ is the weighted average of all z i , i =1,2,3,4, according to Eq. (6). Fig. 4 (a) shows the output CSI ^ as a grid around the data, where it can be observed that the model follows adequately the experimental data. The new model provides the lowest modeled CSI values for the lowest Ce values (Fig. 4(a)). However, the lowest Ce values are associated with high EEG activity, once increasing concentrations of hypnotics induces EEG depression. In fact, it is possible to observe from Fig. 4(b) a shift of the model estimates towards the highest EMG values and the lowest Ce values for the highest CSI values. This result indicates that in the presence of low Ce values, the EMG is the variable with more importance in the CSI modeling. The comparison between the new CSI model and the Hill model has to consider that existing differences in performance can be due to differences in the model structure and/or the different inputs. The methodological changes are evaluated comparing the Hill model with the fuzzy model with single input Ce. The impact of the EMG in CSI modeling could not be assessed from the two inputs model, since Ce and EMG are expected to be correlated. This is because the administration of propofol tends to suppress the EMG activity (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007), which was corroborated in G1 protocol, with 9/14 dogs exhibiting a Ce and EMG correlation larger than −0.6. In this way, a fuzzy models with Ce and EMG as only inputs were additionally considered in order to quantify the impact of those variables in the CSI model. These models were estimated following the procedures described in Section 2.2.3 with n =1. As outlined in Table 3 , the CSI model with inputs Ce and EMG is designated as model B, whereas the CSI models with single input Ce or EMG are denoted as models A or C, respectively. Table 4 presents the modeling errors for different protocols and surgical phases. Table 5 resumes the results from a statistical comparison between the models’ errors evaluated in the study period. In the table diagonal, it is reported the comparison for the same model in different groups; in the upper triangle, it is presented the comparison between different models in G1 data; finally in the down triangle, it is the analysis concerning the G2 data. In protocol G1, there were no statistically significant differences in performance between Hill model and model A, indicating that there was no impact of replacing the model structure for CSI modeling. Also in protocol G1, model B achieved lower modeling errors in comparison with both Hill and A model (p =0.012 and p =0.024 respectively, Fig. 5 (a), evidencing the importance of the EMG variable in CSI model. Our results indicate that the difference error(A)−error(B) is highly correlated with EMG standard deviation measured by std40 (R =0.71, p <0.005, Fig. 5(b). The positive correlation indicates that model B over-performs model A with increased EMG activity. Actually, the value 61.59 for std40 corresponds to equal performance for the two models, for std40 values higher than 61.59 the model B over-performs the model A. Finally, there was no significant difference in performance between model C and B (p >0.1), corroborating that EMG is an important variable in the CSI model. Regarding protocol G2, no significant differences were found between the performances of the models. The models were also compared in the surgical period (Table 6 ), evidencing no pairwise significant differences either in protocol G1 or G2. However, when each model’s performance was compared for different protocols (diagonal in Table 6), models B and C performed better in protocol G2 data rather than G1 (p <0.05). Finally, the bias of each model in each protocol/condition was estimated according to Eq. (7). Statistical analysis indicated that all confidence intervals over the median bias include the value 0 (p <0.05), therefore the hypothesis of unbiased CSI modeling could not be rejected. 4 Discussion and conclusions In this work, a novel approach to CSI modeling is applied to veterinarian anesthesia. DoA indices are traditionally modeled using the Hill equation and considering Ce as the only input of the system (Holford and Sheiner, 1982; Tzabazis et al., 2004; Guarracino et al., 2005; De Smet et al., 2007; Ionescu et al., 2008). However, in protocol G1 the correlation between Hill model residuals ( CSI - CSI ^ ) , Eq. (3)) and EMG is found to be significant for all dogs (p <0.01 for 14/14 dogs). Also, the CSI and EMG correlation is found to be positive for all cases, exceeding 0.6 in 13/14 dogs. These results in the experimental data point out that the EMG should be an input of the CSI model, in addition to Ce. The model C residuals are found to be significantly correlated with Ce in 13/14 dogs (p <0.01), indicating that the Ce should not be discarded from the CSI model. These evidences found in the experimental data suggest the use of model B in CSI modeling, i.e., combining fuzzy logic approach with inputs Ce and EMG. Regarding model B structure, three membership functions covered the EMG range of values, indicating that the system is more sensitive to variations in EMG values (Fig. 3). On the contrary, the Ce membership functions are overlapped, suggesting that the system does not fully exploit the Ce domain information. Model B follows adequately the real data (Fig. 4(a)). Nevertheless, the extrapolation of this model can cause misleading interpretations, because it is expected that the largest CSI values are associated with the lowest Ce values (Jensen et al., 2006). As a matter of fact, the experimental data plotted in Fig. 4 associate the largest CSI values with Ce values near 0 and EMG values near 100. This result is in accordance with the expected interpretation because large CSI values indicate full electroencephalographic and electromyographic activity. This shift of the highest CSI values towards the lowest Ce and highest EMG values, indicates that higher CSI values are more associated with EMG rather than with Ce (Fig. 4(b)). The new model B is also compared with the traditional Hill model. Models A and C are additionally considered to explore existing differences due to methodology and/or the different inputs (Table 3). The results in the study period indicate that there is no loss of performance when the Hill model is replaced by the fuzzy logic structure (Hill versus A, p =0.288). Model B exhibits significantly lower modeling errors than model A (p =0.024) and similar performance in comparison with model C (p =0.948). Finally, the performance of model B (or C) increases in comparison with model A and Hill for increasing EMG changes (p <0.005), indicating that the EMG-based models better capture CSI changes in a recording. The methods are also compared for two different administration protocols: G1 with a constant infusion rate and Cp targets, and G2 via bolus. Traditionally, the propofol is administered by bolus, although with the introduction of automatic syringe pumps in clinical practice, the drug is nowadays more often administered using constant infusions or Cp/Ce targets. Bennett et al. (1998) point out the benefits of constant infusion (G1) versus bolus (G2) administration, e.g., the increase in the hemodynamic stability. The results in Table 5 indicate that Hill and model A follow better data from G2 protocol than the data from G1 protocol, as the modeling error increased significantly in G1 data (p <0.05). This is an expected result because protocol G1 was designed with continuous propofol administration while Hill-based CSI model assumes a sigmoidal CSI/Ce relation, adapted for protocols designed with bolus propofol administration, as G2. The new model B is found to exhibit similar performances in both protocols (G1 versus G2, p =0.145), and similar to that of the Hill and model A in protocol G2 (B versus Hill p =0.522, B versus A p =0.234). These results pointed out advantages of CSI model B over Hill model, evidencing that Hill model may not be suitable for non-bolus protocols, while model B exhibits a comparable response in different types of protocols. In the safer continuous infusion protocol (Bennett et al., 1998), model B is found to exhibit the lowest median modeling error in comparison with the other models (Table 4). In the surgical period, only models B and C achieved a better performance for protocol G2 than for G1 (Table 6). In both protocols, the propofol is administrated according to clinical necessity, but there are important differences in the experimental data, which may explain the better performance of the EMG based models in protocol G2. In fact, the dogs in protocol G1 received more propofol during the study period than those of protocol G2 and, therefore, it is expected that the EMG would be more suppressed in Surgery period for the dogs in protocol G1. The results indicated that the better performance of model B in protocol G2 than in G1, is significantly correlated with a decrease in the standard deviation of Ce and an increase in EMG standard deviation (Eq. (9)), G2 versus G1. In the surgical period, Ce is almost constant while EMG is more variable, once there is stimulus that affects the EMG activity. Therefore, EMG tends to provide more useful information to CSI model than Ce. The better performance of model B in comparison with Hill model is found to be directly related with the increase of EMG activity. However, the EMG may be suppressed during surgery, either spontaneously or by the administration of muscle relaxants. In such cases, our results indicated that model B maintains its performance comparing to the Hill model (Tables 5 and 6). The improved performance with model B is probably a consequence of the limitations associated to using a human DoA monitor in dogs. The CSI and EMG are calculated by band pass filtering of an electric activity signal, collected by sensors placed in the head. In the head, both muscular and cerebral electrical activities are present. However, dogs are expected to exhibit EEG activity of higher frequencies in comparison with humans (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007), which leads to a shift of EEG frequencies in dogs towards the EMG frequency band. This evidence suggests a more pronounced spectral overlap between EEG and EMG, and the possibility that the acquired “EMG” is in fact a mixture of high frequency EEG and electromyographic activity (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007; Ekman et al., 2007). In conclusion, this study suggests that the cutoff frequency to distinguish EEG and EMG set in the human CSM monitor may not be suitable for monitoring depth of anesthesia in dogs. The CSI performance in dogs can be improved by introducing the input EMG to the CSI model. These improvements are related to the changes in muscular activity induced by propofol, which can be quantified by a measure of EMG dispersion, such as std40, associated to a probable more pronounced spectral overlap between EEG and EMG in dogs. Overall, this work shows that the CSI modeling in dogs can be improved using the current human anesthesia set-up, once the EMG signal is acquired simultaneously with the CSI index. However, it does not invalidate the search of new indices more suitable to use in dog’s anesthesia.

The results indicate that fuzzy models exhibit a similar performance in both conditions, and their performance is significantly higher with real data than with surrogate data.

However, associated with this devices and long-term signal, are artefacts that conduce to misleading interpretations and diagnosis. So, new developments over automatic ECG classification are needed for a reliable interpretation. The feasibility of the cardiac systems is one of the main concerns, once they are currently used as diagnosis or help systems. In this project, an artefact detection algorithm is developed, dividing the time-series in intervals of signal and artefact. The algorithm is based on the assumption that, if the analysed frame is signal, there is not an abrupt alteration over consecutive short windows. So, the time-series is divided in consecutive nonoverlapped short windows. Over these windows, it is calculated the time-series standard deviation, the maximum and minimum slope. A threshold-based rule is applied, and the algorithm reveals that, in mean, it is verified a 99.29% of correctly classified signal and only 0.71% of signal erroneously classified. Over the results obtained, the algorithm seems to present good results, however it is needed its validation in a wider and representative sample with segments marked as artefact by multiple specialists.",

Study design Prospective clinical study. Animals Fourteen mixed breed dogs, weighing 24.5±4.7kg, scheduled to undergo neutering procedures. Methods Dogs were premedicated with 0.05mgkg-1 acepromazine intramuscularly. The CSM and cardiovascular monitoring equipment were attached. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol using a target controlled infusion (TCI) to varying plasma propofol targets (PropCp). Following endotracheal intubation the dogs were ventilated with oxygen. Anaesthetic maintenance was with propofol by TCI. A PropCp of 3μgdL-1 was set initially, then PropCps were increased in 1μgdL-1 steps to 7, 9 and then 11μgdL-1. Each PropCp was held constant for a 5minute period, at the end of which depth of anaesthesia was classified using a previously evaluated scale of 'planes' based on palpebral and corneal reflexes and eye position. Cerebral state index (CSI), burst suppression (BSR) and electromyogram were measured at these time points. The prediction probability (PK) of these variables, or of the PropCp in predicting depth of anaesthesia was calculated. Results The PKs for predicting anaesthetic planes were 0.74, 0.91, 0.76 and 0.78 for CSI, BSR, EMG and PropCp, respectively. The PKs for PropCp to predict CSI, BSR and EMG were 0.65, 0.71 and 0.65 respectively. Conclusion and clinical relevance The Cerebral State Monitor was able to detect very deep planes of anaesthesia when BSR occurs, but was not able to distinguish between the intermediate anaesthetic planes likely to be used in clinical anaesthesia. © 2011 The Authors.

        "doc_abstract": "Cerebral State Index (CSI) is a measure of depth of anesthesia (DoA) developed for humans, which is traditionally modeled with the Hill equation and the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce). The CSI has been studied in dogs and showed several limitations related to the interpretation of EEG data. Nevertheless, the CSI has a lot of potential for DoA monitoring in dogs, it just needs to be adjusted for this species. In this work, an adapted CSI model is presented for dogs considering a) both Ce and EMG as inputs and b) a fuzzy logic structure with parameters optimized using the ANFIS method. The new model is compared with traditional Hill model using data from dogs in routine surgery. The results showed no significant impact in the model performance with the change of model structure (Fuzzy instead of Hill). The residuals of the Hill model were significantly correlated with the EMG, indicating that the latter should be considered in the model. In fact, the EMG introduction in CSI model significantly decreased the modeling error: 11.8 [8.6; 15.2] (fuzzy logic) versus 20.9 [16.4; 29.0] (Hill). This work shows that CSI modeling in dogs can be improved using the current human anesthesia set-up, once the EMG signal is acquired simultaneously with the CSI index. However, it does not invalidate the search of new DoA indices more adjusted to use in dog's anesthesia. © 2011 IEEE.",

The objective of this study was to analyse the correlation between ocular reflexes, CSI and estimated propofol plasma concentrations (PropCP) in dogs during induction of anaesthesia with propofol. Fourteen dogs were premedicated with acepromazine 0.05 mg kg-1 IM. Anaesthesia was induced with a 200 ml h-1 propofol 1% constant infusion rate until loss of corneal reflex using RugLoop II software with Beths' pharmacokinetic model to estimate PropCp. Palpebral reflex (PR) and the corneal reflex (CR) were tested every 30 s and classified as present (+) or absent (-), and eyeball position was registered as rotated ventromedialy (ERV) or centred (EC). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CSI values were analyzed from baseline before the beginning of propofol infusion (T0) until loss of CR; CSI and PropCp, CSI and anaesthetic planes, and PropCp and anaesthetic planes were compared using correlation analysis. PropCp reached 7.65 ± 2.1 μg ml-1 at the end of the study. CSI values at T0 were 89.2 ± 3.8. Based on the observation of ocular reflexes and eyeball position, it was possible to define five anaesthetic planes: A (superficial) to E (deep), being A (PR+/CR+/EC), B (PR+/ERV/CR+), C (PR-/ERV/CR+), D (PR-/EC/CR+) and E (PR-/EC/CR-). There was a significant correlation between PropCp and the anaesthetic planes (R = 0,861; P < 0.01). No significant correlation was observed between CSI and the anaesthetic planes or between CSI and PropCp. MAP decreased significantly from T0 until loss of corneal reflex (from 98 ± 14 mmHg to 82 ± 12 mmHg); HR did not change significantly (from 101 ± 30 bpm to 113 ± 16 bpm). The CSI monitoring was not consistent with the clinical observations observed in the different stages of depth anaesthesia. This could limit the use of CSI for monitoring depth of anaesthesia with propofol. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Tel.: +351228348170; fax: +351228348171. The cerebral state index (CSI) is used for monitoring EEG and depth of anaesthesia. The objective of this study was to analyse the correlation between ocular reflexes, CSI and estimated propofol plasma concentrations (PropCP) in dogs during induction of anaesthesia with propofol. Fourteen dogs were premedicated with acepromazine 0.05mgkg−1 IM. Anaesthesia was induced with a 200mlh−1 propofol 1% constant infusion rate until loss of corneal reflex using RugLoop II software with Beths’ pharmacokinetic model to estimate PropCp. Palpebral reflex (PR) and the corneal reflex (CR) were tested every 30s and classified as present (+) or absent (−), and eyeball position was registered as rotated ventromedialy (ERV) or centred (EC). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CSI values were analyzed from baseline before the beginning of propofol infusion (T0) until loss of CR; CSI and PropCp, CSI and anaesthetic planes, and PropCp and anaesthetic planes were compared using correlation analysis. PropCp reached 7.65±2.1μgml−1 at the end of the study. CSI values at T0 were 89.2±3.8. Based on the observation of ocular reflexes and eyeball position, it was possible to define five anaesthetic planes: A (superficial) to E (deep), being A (PR+/CR+/EC), B (PR+/ERV/CR+), C (PR−/ERV/CR+), D (PR−/EC/CR+) and E (PR−/EC/CR−). There was a significant correlation between PropCp and the anaesthetic planes (R =0,861; P <0.01). No significant correlation was observed between CSI and the anaesthetic planes or between CSI and PropCp. MAP decreased significantly from T0 until loss of corneal reflex (from 98±14mmHg to 82±12mmHg); HR did not change significantly (from 101±30bpm to 113±16bpm). The CSI monitoring was not consistent with the clinical observations observed in the different stages of depth anaesthesia. This could limit the use of CSI for monitoring depth of anaesthesia with propofol. Keywords CSI Cerebral state index TCI Propofol Brain monitoring Anaesthesia monitoring 1 Introduction The concept of depth anaesthesia is dimensionless. Without any objective monitoring, the subjective descriptions ‘too light’, ‘too deep’ or ‘enough’ are not helpful for a careful assessment of the adequate plane of anaesthesia (Pomfrett, 1999). The observation of physical signs, such as somatic muscle tone, respiratory patterns and ocular signs allowed assigning to a given stage of anaesthesia (Heiko, 2004). So far, only ether was used to define the clinical stages according to anaesthetic depth (Bhargava et al., 2004). The development of a brain monitor that can be used in dogs is a real necessity to monitor depth of anaesthesia more objectively. The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a direct measurement of the functional state of the brain which makes the monitoring of increasing anaesthetic depth and the detection of unnecessary depth of anaesthesia possible (Lunn et al., 1987). Different EEG patterns such as decreasing EEG frequency and increasing wave amplitude can be observed with increasing anaesthetic concentrations. These and other changes can be described and quantified statistically (Miller et al., 2004), and algorithms can be introduced in EEG monitoring devices and used to access the depth of anaesthesia. The cerebral state monitor (CSM), an EEG monitor, was recently introduced for monitoring the depth of anaesthesia in humans, proving to be a useful tool (Jensen et al., 2006). This monitor has not yet been validated in dogs but there is a possibility that the cerebral state index (CSI) displayed by the CSM could be used for EEG monitoring in dogs (Ribeiro et al., 2008). The objective of this study is to analyse the correlation between depth of anaesthesia by monitoring ocular reflexes, and CSI and estimated propofol plasma concentrations in dogs during induction of anaesthesia with propofol. 2 Methods 2.1 Patients and haemodynamic monitoring Fourteen healthy dogs undergoing scheduled routine surgical procedures were enrolled in this study. All dogs were premedicated with 0.05mgkg−1 Acepromazine IM (Calmivet®, Vetoquinol, France), thirty minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anaesthesia. A cannula was inserted in the cephalic vein for drug and fluid administration. A three way stopcock was used to connect the intravenous catheter to the propofol and sodium chloride 0.9% delivery lines. A Braun infusion pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was used for the administration of sodium chloride at a constant infusion rate of 10mlkg−1 hr−1 during the entire study period. An S/5 Datex monitor (Datex-Ohmeda; Helsinki, Finland) was used for monitoring the haemodynamic parameters. The blood pressure was measured non-invasively in the anterior carpus of the left hind leg using repeated measurements: each measurement was made immediately after the preceding one (Datex S/5 “STAT” mode). Heart rate was monitored by three ECG electrodes placed according to Academy of Veterinary Cardiology Committee. 2.2 Cerebral state index monitoring The CSI and frontal electromyographic activity (EMG) data were collected every five seconds from a cerebral state monitor (CSM) (Danmeter, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark) using three clamp, ECG electrodes (Seitsonen et al., 2000), placed in standard position in the midline of the head. The EEG waveform in our study was derived from the signal recorded between the frontopolar electrode (positive) represented by the white color and the occipital electrode (negative) represented by the black color, according to Pelegrino and colleagues’ studies (Pellegrino and Sica, 2004). The ground or the reference electrode was placed in the parietal position. The frequency of the waveform was between 2 and 35Hz and CSM monitor collected 2000 sampless−1 (14bits equivalent), with an update every one second. To calculate the CSI, frequencies outside the 6–42Hz range were filtered out (Danmeter, 2004). Impedances were kept low (within 1k and 3k) by using a special wax (Elefix, paste for EEG, Nihon Kohden Corporation) placed between the electrodes and the skin. The CSI is calculated using four sub-parameters of the electroencephalogram: β ratio, α ratio, β ratio–α ratio, and burst suppression. These sub-parameters are used to define two energy ratios called alpha (α) and beta (β). Both α and β show a shift in the energy content from the higher to the lower frequencies with deeper anaesthesia. This information can be used to achieve an index which varies from 0 to 100 (Jensen et al., 2006). The monitor also evaluates the amount of instantaneous burst suppression (BS) in each thirty-second period that quantifies the amount of isoelectric waves in the EEG. These EEG periods characterise the deepest levels of hypnosis. Signal quality index (SQI) was collected at a constant rate. The SQI is calculated using the quality of the acquired EEG signal and on the signal artefacts during the previous one minute period. The electrode-to-skin impedance is included in the SQI calculation. The SQI is displayed numerically as percentage units (0–100%, 100% equals best signal quality). Electrode-to-skin impedances at 1kΩ result in a SQI of 100. If the impedance of the white or black sensors exceeds 1kΩ, the SQI will gradually decrease (Danmeter, 2004). When excessive noise is detected, the SQI is also diminished reflecting the disturbance (Danmeter, 2004). If the sensor impedance is >5kΩ the CSI, BS and EMG will be blank (“- -“ displayed). 2.3 Anaesthetic protocol RugLoop II® software (developed by Tom DeSmet (Demed Engineering, Temse, Belgium) and Michel Struys (Ghent University, Gent, Belgium)) running on a personal computer was used to drive the propofol syringe pump. The pharmacokinetic model for propofol from Beths and colleagues (Beths et al., 2001) was incorporated in the RugLoop II® software and was used to estimate the propofol plasma concentrations (PropCp). RugLoop II® was also used to store the pharmacokinetic, haemodynamic and electroencephalographic data every five seconds. Anaesthesia was induced using a constant infusion rate of 200mlh−1 of propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi®; Bad Homburg, Germany). Throughout this period, the animals were breathing 100% oxygen through a face mask. The end point of the propofol administration was the moment when the dogs lost their corneal reflex. However if the dogs became apnoeic (did not breathe for more than 15s) or hypotensive (meaning their arterial blood pressure dropped below 60mmHg) the propofol administration was stopped. After the end of the study the dog was intubated and prepared for the scheduled surgery. No stimuli were applied at any time to the dogs other than testing reflexes. 2.4 Clinical observation of the depth of anaesthesia Before the induction of anaesthesia and after premedication, the dogs were placed in sternal recumbency. The first reflexes were tested when the dogs changed to a lateral recumbence without a cervical tonus after the beginning of the propofol infusion. The palpebral and corneal reflexes were tested every 30s with a swab moistened with serum. The palpebral reflex was tested gently at the lateral canthus of the eye, and corneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the cornea. Each reflex was tested three times and considered negative if there was no response to the three taps with the swab. The eyeball position was also observed at each test. Thus, palpebral reflex (PR) and corneal reflex (CR) were classified as present (+) or absent (−); the position of the eyeball was described as eyeball rotated ventormedially (ERV) if the pupil was looking towards the middle eye corner, or centred (EC) if the pupil was centred between the superior and inferior palpebral. The tests were performed by the same operator for all of the dogs. 2.5 Data and statistical analysis The results obtained from testing the reflexes were analyzed and grouped according to the propofol concentrations and, consequently, with anaesthetic depth. A letter representing a different plane of anaesthesia was given to each group of reflexes. Data was tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro Wilk test. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and CSI values were analyzed from baseline values before the beginning of propofol infusion (T0) until the loss of corneal reflex using the Wilcoxon. The Spearman Rank correlation analysis was used to compare CSI and PropCp, CSI and anaesthetic planes, and anaesthetic planes and PropCp. A delay of 50s in CSI data was taken into account when analyzing CSI data (Pilge et al., 2006). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.13.0 for Windows. Data was expressed in mean±sd; |R|>0.5 and P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3 Results Fourteen mixed breed dogs aged 2.6±0.9years, including 8 females, weighing 25.3±5.28kg were analysed. The results from prospectively analyzing the ocular reflexes indicated five levels of anaesthetic depth (A–E) (Table 1 ). CSI decreased from baseline to plane E (Table 2 ) but no significant correlation was observed between CSI and these anaesthetic planes (R =0.26; Fig. 1 ), or between CSI and PropCp) (R =0.478). Nevertheless, a strong correlation was observed between PropCp and the anaesthetic planes (R =0.887; P <0.01). In plane E, all dogs lost their palpebral and corneal reflex, and were intubated with laryngeal reflex absent. At this time point lower EMG values associated with lower CSI values were observed. Four dogs showed high EMG values in this plane associated with high CSI values. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 16% from the baseline to plane E (P <0.05). Heart rate did not change significantly during the study (Table 2). 4 Discussion This study analysed the effect of propofol on CSI, ocular reflexes, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure during the induction of anaesthesia with propofol in dogs. Five different anaesthetic planes based on the analysis of ocular reflexes were identified in dogs under propofol anaesthesia. In fact PropCp showed a strong correlation with these anaesthetic planes and so, different PropCp intervals are proposed in order to achieve a desired depth of anaesthesia. On the other hand, CSI decreased with increasing propofol concentrations but there was no correlation between CSI and the depth of anaesthesia provided by the anaesthetic planes in this study. Thus, CSI does not seem to provide trustworthy clinical information for monitoring the depth of anaesthesia in dogs during the induction of anaesthesia with propofol. The haemodynamic parameters monitored in this study provided very little information about the depth of anaesthesia when using propofol as hypnotic agent. In fact only mean arterial pressure decreased by about 16% from baseline to plane E, which is of limited clinical use when monitoring depth of anaesthesia. The development of a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model for propofol for dogs (Beths et al., 2001) allowed the use of TCI in veterinary anaesthesia practice. The concentrations obtained with the propofol constant rate infusion of 200mlh−1 were based on Beths pharmacokinetic model (Beths et al., 2001). Although in our study no blood analyses were performed to measure the real propofol concentration in the blood, there are studies showing that TCI using this pharmacokinetic model in dogs allows a better propofol titration with improved control of anaesthetic depth (Beths et al., 2001) and less undesired side effects (Musk et al., 2005) when compared to manual infusion. The effects of propofol on the EEG are well described in humans (Sleigh et al., 2001). The administration of low doses of propofol increases the amplitude and the EEG alpha wave rhythm, followed by a shift to EEG gamma and theta frequency. Higher doses produce burst suppression and decrease in the EEG amplitude (Jensen et al., 2006). A good monitor of depth of anaesthesia should accurately distinguish these EEG changes and correlate them with different anaesthetic depth. The most studied monitor in veterinary science is the bispectral index monitor BIS (March and Muir, 2005). This monitor seems to have some limitations when used in animals, especially when burst suppression is observed after the administration of large anaesthetic doses (March and Muir, 2005). In these studies, the hypnotic agents were essentially halogenated and the results showed limited BIS usefulness for monitoring the degree of central nervous system (CNS) depression (Greene et al., 2004; Martin-Cancho et al., 2006). Increased concentrations of anaesthetic agents decreased BIS but could not accurately estimate the BIS interval where it is safe to anaesthetise veterinary patients (Lamont et al., 2005; March and Muir, 2005). For example, in pigs BIS seems to interpret the burst suppression in the EEG as an indicator of awakening, showing high BIS values even during a steady state of anaesthesia (Greene et al., 2004). In humans, CSI monitoring has recently been introduced to monitor the hypnotic state of patients during anaesthetic procedures, but demonstrates more variability in the baseline when compared with BIS. However, both monitors have a high probability of predicting loss of consciousness, loss of reflexes and good correlations with the Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAAS) (Zhong et al., 2005). Jensen and colleagues concluded that the CSI could be a reasonable alternative to the BIS monitor. In a previous study, our group proposed the CSI as a possible satisfactory alternative to BIS for monitoring depth of anaesthesia in dogs (Ribeiro et al., 2008). This study showed that the cerebral electrical changes induced by a 6mgkg−1 bolus dose of propofol was detected by the CSI monitoring of dogs during induction of anaesthesia. The negative correlation between CSI and PropCp suggested that the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in dogs. However, results from this study indicate that when anaesthesia is induced using a propofol constant infusion rate, CSI correlation is lower than the previous study (Ribeiro et al., 2008). A possible reason for such differences may be related to the time needed to transfer the drug to the effect site. The concentration at the brain in the case of hypnotics depends on the concentration gradient (Musk et al., 2005). When a bolus of 6mgkg−1 of propofol is administered, the time lag needed for the propofol plasma and effect-site concentrations to reach the equilibrium is small. Thus, the CSI rapidly reflects the propofol concentrations in the brain by showing lower CSI values. In a constant rate of propofol infusion, the propofol plasma concentration increases more slowly. Thus, the gradient of concentration of propofol between the plasma and the effect-site is lower, and the time to transfer the drug to the effect site is longer. Furthermore, this study showed a higher standard deviation at the maximum estimated propofol plasma concentration (7.65±2.16μgml−1) when compared with the bolus study (7.18±0.39μgml−1). This may be explained by the fact that in this study propofol infusion was stopped based on clinical assessments. According to the CSI manufacturer, CSI values in humans higher than 90 indicate an “awake” brain, between 80 and 70 indicate deep sedation, between 60 and 40 indicate general anaesthesia and below 40 indicate excessive anaesthesia (Danmeter, 2004). As we can see in Table 2, the CSI values are far from correlating with these intervals. Furthermore CSI had no correlation with propofol-estimated plasma concentrations and no correlation with the clinical signs of the anaesthetic planes referred in this study. It is known that EMG activity is the most significant source of EEG artefact. Despite the fact that the CSI algorithm also incorporates an EMG filter that removes most of the potential interfering EMG activity, the EMG still has a significant influence on the CSI value (Jensen et al., 2006). The influence of EMG in dogs may be particularly important due to the amount of muscles in the head compared with humans. In an attempt to diminish the influence from EMG produced by temporal muscles electrodes were placed in the mid-line. The influence of EMG on the CSI values was a constant observation in our study and it seems to be the main reason for the high standard deviation observed in the CSI values during the anaesthetic planes C, D and E (Table 2). Isoelectric EEG periods interrupted by brief periods of high amplitude EEG activity indicates a non-specific reduction in cerebral metabolic activity known as burst suppression (Rampil 1998). Onset of burst suppression has historically been associated with a surgical plane of anaesthesia (stage III, planes 2 and 3) (March and Muir, 2005). In our study, the BS was observed in three out of the four dogs that had values of CSI below 40 and happened more consistently in plane E of anaesthesia where all dogs lost their corneal reflex. Another important parameter to take into account when using CSI monitoring is the SQI. The SQI represents the quality of the received EEG signal. The calculation of SQI is based on a series of artefacts that occur during each one-minute period. The SQI is also influenced by the impedance of the electrodes in the skin. Impedances of the black and white electrodes superior to 3kΩ will negatively influence SQI and thus affect CSI monitoring (Danmeter, 2004). During the entire study period, impedances were kept low (within 1kΩ and 3kΩ) by using wax placed between electrodes and the skin. Propofol decreases the arterial blood pressure by central depression of sympathetic neural output, which results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and potential hypotension (Clayes et al., 1988). Studies in sheep show that rapid injection of propofol for the induction of anaesthesia produces more effects on cardiovascular systems than a slower infusion rate (Zheng et al., 1998). In our study, no hypotensive episodes were observed and mean arterial blood pressure showed an average maximum decrease of 16% from “awake” values to the deepest anaesthetic stage observed (plane E). Heart rate was also within physiologic normal range during the entire study. The slow rate of propofol infusion (a constant infusion of 200mlmin−1) and the dogs’ weight of over 20kg may help to explain the haemodynamic stability. In conclusion, this study proposes five anaesthetic planes based on objective eyeball position and reflex observations during induction of anaesthesia with propofol. The performance of CSM was not consistent with the clinical observations on the different planes of depth of anaesthesia. This may limit its use during the induction of veterinary routine anaesthesia. The good haemodynamic stability provided by some hypnotic agents even at higher concentrations, as seems to occur with propofol, provides little clinical information for monitoring depth of anaesthesia and strengthens the need for an EEG based monitor for veterinary use. Until then, it seems that clinical reflexes still provide useful information that cannot be minimized. Nevertheless, these reflexes are of limited clinical value when using myorelaxant drugs during general anaesthesia. References Beths et al., 2001 T. Beths J.B.

        "doc_abstract": "Target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia using target effect-site concentration rather than plasma concentration provides less drug consumption, safer anesthesia, less undesired side effects and improved animal welfare. The aim of this study was to calculate the constant that converts propofol plasma into effect-site concentration (ke0) in dogs, and to implement it in a TCI system and compare it with the effect on the central nervous system (CNS). All dogs were subjected to general anesthesia using propofol. Fourteen dogs were used as the pilot group to calculate ke0, using the t peak method. Fourteen dogs were used as the test group to test and validate the model. Rugloop ii® software was used to drive the propofol syringe pump and to collect data from S/5 Datex monitor and cerebral state monitor. The calculated ke0 was incorporated in an existing pharmacokinetic model (Beths Model). The relationship between propofol effect site concentrations and anesthetic planes, and propofol plasma and effect-site concentrations was compared using Pearson's correlation analysis. Average t peak was 3.1 min resulting in a ke0 of 0.7230 min -1. The test group showed a positive correlation between anesthetic planes and propofol effect-site concentration (R = 0.69; P < 0.0001). This study proposes a ke0 for propofol with results that demonstrated a good adequacy for the pharmacokinetic model and the measured effect. The use of this ke0 will allow an easier propofol titration according to the anesthetic depth, which may lead to a reduction in propofol consumption and less undesired side effects usually associated to high propofol concentrations in dogs. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",

INTRODUCTION Anaesthesia can be defined as the lack of response and recall to noxious stimuli, involving the use of three drugs, a muscle relaxant, an anaesthetic (hypnotic) and an analgesic. The analgesic drug is of great importance since it affects the pharmacodynamics of the anaesthetic drug and there is no clear indicator of the degree of pain. The analgesic and anaesthetic drugs are interconnected, since they interact with each other so as to achieve an adequate level of depth of anaesthesia (DOA) and analgesia (Vuyk, 1999). The possibility of consciousness during surgery is a factor that affects 1 clinicians and patients. The brain signals (e.g. electroencephalogram EEG) are used to indicate the level of DOA, measuring the depression in the central nervous system. But, haemodynamic signals indicate the level of analgesia and stability (McGregor et al., 1998)(O'Hare et al., 1999). The heart rate (HR) (i.e. the number of heart beats per unit of time) is an haemodynamic signal, which as normal values around 72 beat/min. Overall, general anaesthesia consists of both loss of consciousness through the acting of the anaesthetic drugs, and the inhibition of noxious stimuli reaching the brain through the acting of the analgesics. The intravenous anaesthetic drug propofol is used in combination with the analgesic remifentanil. Propofol and remifentanil have a synergistic relationship. The effect of the combination of these two drugs is greater than that expected as based on the concentration-effect relationships of the in- Corresponding author: Dr. Catarina S. Nunes, Departamento de Matem´tica Aplicada, FCUP, Rua do Campo a Alegre 687, 4169-007 Porto, Portugal (ccnunes@fc.up.pt) Financial support: Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology POSC/EEA-SRI/57607/2004. dividual agents (Vuyk et al., 1997). The properties of remifentanil make it a suitable analgesic for use with propofol, and adequate for control in anaesthesia. A model for heart rate can be very useful to understand the effect of different drugs and drugs' interactions. This model could have in consideration only the effect of remifentanil or remifentanil and propofol. Since remifentanil has a stronger effect than propofol on the haemodynamic signals (McAtamney et al., 1998)(Prakash et al., 2001). However, drug interactions can influence HR. The aim of this study is to develop a model that can describe the characteristics and trend of patient HR under general anaesthesia. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model structure was used, since it is a good model for processes without seasonality and with high variability. Heart rate variability increases in the presence of pain (Toweill et al., 2003). In this work, a comparative study will be performed on a wide group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of GARCH models with different input variables (effect concentration of remifentanil or remifentanil and propofol). The clinical data are presented in section 2. Section 3 describes the model that was applied to the clinical data, for the concentration-effect relationship on HR. The results are presented in section 4. And sections 5 and 6 present the discussion and conclusions. Fig. 1. 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The plasma concentration is defined as the concentration in compartment 1. Fig. 2. Effect compartment model 2.1 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Models The PK models of the two drugs use a 3compartment model (figure 1). For propofol, the PK parameters from Schnider (Schnider et al., 1998) were used, whereas for remifentanil, the parameters from Minto (Minto et al., 1997a) were used. The PK models have its parameters adjusted to age, gender, weight and height of the patients. 2.2 Effect Compartment The effect compartment is a hypothetical compartment describing the delay between the plasma concentration and the effect concentration. Figure 2 shows the diagram of the effect compartment relationship. The pharmacodynamic parameters ke0 used were described by Schnider (Schnider et al., 1999) for propofol, and for remifentanil by Minto (Minto et al., 1997b). 2. CLINICAL DATA Data collected during 16 neurosurgical interventions were used in this study. All 16 patients were subject to general anaesthesia using the anaesthetic drug propofol and the analgesic drug remifentanil. The level of unconsciousness (DOA) was manually controlled by the anaesthetist using as reference the patient's vital signs and the bispectral index of the EEG (BIS) monitor. The following clinical signs were recorded during the surgery every 5 seconds: BIS, infusion rate of propofol and remifentanil, haemodynamic parameters. The infusion rates were used to calculate the plasma and effect concentration of both drugs, as described in the following subsections. The 16 patients studied were Glasgow 15, ASA 1/2, 46.3±15 years, 64±14 kg, 164±8 cm, 10 female. Anaesthesia started with a constant infusion 200 ml/hr of propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC), thereafter propofol was changed according to the BIS value. The remifentanil infusion started at LOC. The mean duration of surgery was 482.2±195.4 minutes (245.0 - 972.2). 2.3 Average Patient The data of an average patient was constructed using the average values of all 16 patients (i.e. their signals, figure 3). This average patient was used to determine the fixed structure of the model for HR. 3. GARCH MODEL Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the HR model. The objective is to describe the relationship between the drugs effect concentrations and its effect. Fig. 4. Block diagram of the HR model. 3.2 Implementation To develop a model it is necessary to specify inputs and outputs, estimation parameters with any optimization technique, evaluate errors and validate the model. Each patient reacts to pain in a different way. Two GARCH models were implemented: GARCH Model 1 using just the effect concentration of remifentanil; and GARCH Model 2 using the effect concentrations of remifentanil and propofol. A basic fixed structure (equation 4) given by the average patient data was used for the GARCH models. yt = 70.12 + ut 2 2 t = 0.2059 + 0.66922t-1 + 0.30416u2 t-1 (4) Fig. 3. Average patient mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and effect concentrations of propofol and remifentanil. 3.1 Model Structure The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) is a model that predicts the data (time series) and its variance. The change in variability is very important when describing the HR signal. A variance that changes with time has implications in the validity and efficiency of the statistical inference of the parameters that describe HR (yt ) (Hamilton et al., 1994). A process ut , that satisfies equation 1 is described by an ARCH(q) model. u2 = + 1 u2 + 2 u2 + ... + m u2 + t (1) t t-1 t-2 t-q A generalized model GARCH(p,q) is: ut = t vt (2) The HR signal was initially filtered with a moving average filter (6 samples) to remove outliers and then filtered with a lowpass second order Butterworth filter, so as to remove the electrical interference. The parameters of the GARCH models were individually adjusted to each patient data, so as to capture the interindividual variability. A loglikelihood objective function was used to optimize the parameters, using the software MATLAB 6.5.1 4. RESULTS The two models (GARCH model 1 using just the effect concentration of remifentanil and GARCH model 2 using the effect concentrations of remifentanil and propofol) were fitted to the data of the 16 patients. The mean absolute errors were calculated for the results of the two models and for each of the 16 patients. where vt is an independent random sequence with 2 zero mean and unit variance.

This constant error, or shift in scale could be the influence of the other drug (i.e. propofol), for which this model does not account for. The mean absolute error of GARCH Model 1 for the 16 patients was 10.9±9.3. The individual mean absolute errors of the model in all 16 patients are presented in table 1. results of GARCH Model 1 are not present when using GARCH Model 2. The mean absolute error of GARCH Model 2 for the 16 patients was 11.2±9. The individual mean absolute errors of the model in all 16 patients are presented in table 2. 5. DISCUSSION Analyzing the figures, the results of GARCH Model 2 do not have any scale shift from the real data. However, the mean absolute error shows that on average a smaller error is associated with GARCH Model 1, which only takes into consideration the effect concentration of remifentanil. Remifentanil is a drug that directly affects the haemodynamic signals (Vuyk, 1999). 4.2 Results with the GARCH Model 2 The results of GARCH Model 2 are good, following the HR trend in all patients. Figures 7 and 8 show the model results for patient PA13 and PA12. The amplitude shift that was present in the 6. CONCLUSIONS 130 PA12 Heart rate Heart rate model 120 110 100 beat/min 90 80 70 The heamodynamic stability under surgery depends on the patient's individual response to the drugs. The degree of sensitivity/resistance of the patient to the drugs has a great influence on the amount of drugs necessary during surgery, to maintain an adequate level of unconsciousness and analgesia. Information extracted from models can be used to adapt the infusion rates of both drugs, avoiding cases of overdosage or pain. The control system parameters could be adjusted or adapted to individual patient requirements. The two GARCH models tested in this study proved to be efficient in modeling the HR variation according to the concentrations of the anaesthetic drugs. These models can be used in the operating theatre to predict the HR trend according to the drug concentrations used by the anaesthesiologist, i.e. as an advisor system. Haemodynamic stability as measured by the HR its clinically important, specially under surgery. HR variations are associated with the level of pain, and depend on the individual patient. In the future, this model can be automatically adjusted to the patient, identify the degree of pain and subsequently help to adjust the dose of the analgesic, improving the patients' comfort and safety 60 50 0 50 100 150 minutes 200 250 300 350 Fig. 8.

A Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model was used to model HR considering the effect concentrations of the anaesthetic propofol and the analgesic remifentanil, using the clinical data of 16 patients. The model was able to capture the HR trend in all 16 patients with very small errors throughout the surgical time. A correlation was found between the GARCH parameters and patient baseline characteristics, leading to the possibility a patient adjusted adaptive model.
