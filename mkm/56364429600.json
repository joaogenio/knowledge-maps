        "doc_abstract": "© 2022 The Society of Manufacturing EngineersThe current need to develop Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes capable of producing defect-free, fully-dense functional ceramics could benefit from the knowledge consolidated throughout the years in conventional processing. This review provides an up-to-date status of AM fabrication of dense alumina, zirconia and their composites, in comparison with reference values published during 20 years of research on powder pressing and colloidal-based technologies. A systematic literature search on conventional methods and AM selected 1706 papers and, after screening, 344 papers included 1313 different experiments reporting relative density and mechanical properties (flexural strength, elastic modulus, hardness and fracture toughness) of the final ceramics. The associations between experimental processing conditions, densification and, subsequently, mechanical performance were evaluated in powder- and suspension-based technologies. The research evolution in the fabrication of these ceramics over the last two decades is also summarized, highlighting the most used AM technologies for each material and the place of functional ceramics in recent and future market perspectives. Furthermore, future insights in the fabrication of functional ceramics are identified, to guide researchers and commercial players in drawing scientific and industrial novelties for developing new business strategies, key decision-making and road mapping to make the AM market of functional ceramics a reality.",

The current need to develop Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes capable of producing defect-free, fully-dense functional ceramics could benefit from the knowledge consolidated throughout the years in conventional processing. This review provides an up-to-date status of AM fabrication of dense alumina, zirconia and their composites, in comparison with reference values published during 20 years of research on powder pressing and colloidal-based technologies. A systematic literature search on conventional methods and AM selected 1706 papers and, after screening, 344 papers included 1313 different experiments reporting relative density and mechanical properties (flexural strength, elastic modulus, hardness and fracture toughness) of the final ceramics. The associations between experimental processing conditions, densification and, subsequently, mechanical performance were evaluated in powder- and suspension-based technologies. The research evolution in the fabrication of these ceramics over the last two decades is also summarized, highlighting the most used AM technologies for each material and the place of functional ceramics in recent and future market perspectives. Furthermore, future insights in the fabrication of functional ceramics are identified, to guide researchers and commercial players in drawing scientific and industrial novelties for developing new business strategies, key decision-making and road mapping to make the AM market of functional ceramics a reality.

Among others, alumina (Al2O3) [2,3] zirconia [4] (ZrO2, mainly yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal, Y-TZP), and their composites, namely zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) and alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ) [5], are common technical ceramics used in several industrial applications. The excellent thermal, mechanical, electrical and optical properties make them suitable materials to be applied in several domains including aeronautics, energy and refractories industry (such as burners, filters, engine blades, as support for electrical microdevices and chips, capacitors, varistors and semiconductors), as well as in biomaterials field, e.g. prostheses or dentistry materials [1–5]. These functionalities require parts with complex architectures and tight limits in dimensions and properties, thus demanding a high-quality control by the manufacturing companies. Nowadays, at the industrial level, alumina- and zirconia-based ceramics for technical applications are produced by conventional technologies, including powder pressing or colloidal-based ones [3]. Powder pressing and/or distinct sintering processes, such as Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), result in reduced or negligible porosities, desired to achieve advanced performance. However, complex shapes are only possible through the use of time-consuming machining with inherent significant increases in wastes and production costs, resultant to the use of diamond cutting and grinding tools (estimated to account for more than 70 % of the total manufacturing costs) [6,7]. Overcoming these disadvantages, colloidal-based techniques, also known as near-net-shape technologies, have made possible the production of ceramic parts close to the final shape, requiring minimal (or even non-existent) machining and finishing processes [8]. While highly advantageous for complex shapes, disadvantages related to the mould production and casting difficulties can be appointed to these techniques, more pronounced for small geometries and parts. According to the size and geometry of the piece, the drying process in these technologies could also be a critical step, where several microcracks can be formed, weakening the properties of the final material. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies appear as promising alternatives to fabricate ceramic components with complex design and high controlled shape, geometry and size [9]. The ability to produce prototypes, customized parts and low-volume productions without the use of costly mould tooling are strong advantages for the use of AM in the ceramic industry. In the last years, AM of polymeric and metallic materials experienced a great development with several companies investing in these technologies to complement and/or replace conventional processes [10,11], and yet the scenario is different for ceramics. Several obstacles related to ceramics’ specificities, namely processing conditions (including the need for thermal treatment to achieve desired structural properties, high melting points, brittle nature and low ductility), could explain the high difficulties to elevate AM of ceramics to the same progress level as AM of polymers and metals. There is a clear need to develop further materials and reliable technologies for functional ceramics, reflected in the growing interest of research and industrial communities to design AM processes capable of producing defect-free and fully dense ceramic components. In the literature, this is supported by several published review manuscripts related to AM of ceramics, with high incidence in the last 3 years [12–15]. In 2014, Deckers et al. [12] provided a survey of AM methods to shape ceramic parts, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of the single-step (direct) and multi-step (indirect) AM processes. After that, other general reviews related to AM of ceramics have been published mainly focused on the subject status, pairing the most appropriated methods for certain materials and applications, and summarizing the main associated challenges [10,13–16]. On the other hand, review papers more dedicated to the state of a specific AM technology for ceramic materials such as Inkjet Printing [17], Selective Laser Sintering [18,19], Laser Engineering Net-Shaped (LENS) [20] and Robocasting [21] have also been published, including specific requirements, achievements, potential and future developments of these particular technologies for ceramics. The literature also presents review papers focused on certain ceramic applications where AM already holds relevant advancements, e.g. AM of bioceramics for biomedical applications [22–25]. Two review papers published in 2020, concerning the state-of-the-art of AM of zirconia ceramics for dental applications, emphasize the importance of AM in the production of this kind of ceramics [23,24]. Zhang et al. 2020 [24] wrap up the main technologies used for the production of zirconia ceramics, the difficulties in preparing raw materials and the deficiencies and limitations in the existing AM processes. The authors state that zirconia ceramic AM processes are not very mature, and many challenges still need to be addressed mainly concerning the quality of raw materials, process control and the development of ceramic printers. Additionally, modelling and simulation were also referred to as strong tools (that need further development and implementation) to support the selection of materials and processing parameters. As an instance of that, Baltazar et al. 2021 [26] recently evaluated the influence of the in-fill orientation of filaments of alumina ceramics printed by robocasting, through the results of laboratory experiments, modelling and simulation. Finally, Lakhdar et al. 2021 [27] provide a recent and extensive revision regarding the AM progress in advanced ceramic materials, with a focus on the evaluation of the capabilities of each AM technology applied to several functional ceramics, emphasizing the reported results in terms of density, surface finish and mechanical properties. Opportunities, issues, advantages and limitations arising in the ceramics production within each technology, were also discussed. The current literature sustains that AM is becoming a feasible way to produce ceramic complex geometries and shapes, being well-established for porous ceramic parts fabrication at competitive costs. However, a lack of structural quality control is noticed when high-density ceramics are targeted, associated with several defects derived from the conditions of the printing process, nature of feedstock material and post-processes, namely particle size and size distribution of raw powders, solids loading in suspensions (when applicable), amount of organic additives, de-binding procedure, sintering temperature, among others. These factors have also been identified as key parameters in conventional ceramic manufacturing. The knowledge acquired throughout the years in the conventional AM processing of ceramic materials thus can be a strong background from which ceramic AM could absorb, benefit and evolve. Franks et al. [8] defended this idea, highlighting the relevance of the research efforts made in colloidal processing of ceramics for the advanced manufacturing of functional ceramics. The authors claim that the historical development and background knowledge in traditional colloidal shaping techniques, particle surfaces interactions in colloidal media and control of rheological properties of suspensions could be used as strong assistance for AM of ceramics. Therefore, to produce high-density ceramics for functional applications via AM, the interdependencies between the properties of the printed parts and the production settings need to be well understood. The characterization of the current status of AM technologies in the production of dense ceramics (and its comparison to that of conventional technologies) is simultaneously a challenge and a need. The goal of this paper is then to add up the current knowledge on production technologies with quantitative information to support an overview of 20 years of activity and to identify future trends and needs of research. Furthermore, this paper also aims to provide reference values for comparison in future experiments, based on literature related to the production of alumina- and zirconia-based dense ceramics. An exhaustive literature screening on conventional methods (dry pressing and colloidal) and AM processing identified 1706 research papers, from which 344 papers included quantitative information concerning, at least, one experiment. In total, 1313 experiments were identified and, for each experiment, the experimental conditions and corresponding measured properties (relative density and mechanical properties) were registered. This paper presents a detailed description of the screening process in Section 2, including the reference to the automatic search terms, the layout of the manual screening procedure, the description of the collected variables and overall counts. Section 3 provides an overview of the reported structural and mechanical properties for alumina, zirconia and alumina/zirconia composites produced by all processes. Section 4 presents the interdependencies between manufacturing techniques and mechanical performance in alumina- and zirconia-based ceramics, including an overview of the Conventional Powder Pressing (CPP), Conventional Colloidal Techniques (CCT) and AM processes together with a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the results of the systematic review (on the last 20 years of research in this field) are disaggregated to allow the comparison between different production processes, processing conditions and compositions (alumina, zirconia and mixtures of both). Section 5 presents the challenges and future perspectives in this research field, whereas Section 6 is devoted to conclusions and summarizes the main results and future perspectives in AM of technical ceramics. 2 Screening process and data analysis Scheme 1 presents the overall view of the stages implemented in this review. The screening process followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and stages (identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion/exclusion criteria) [28]. Literature papers were screened through an automatic search on SCOPUS database, yielding 1706 initial papers. The title and the abstract of each paper was manually screened, looking for quantitative results on relative density and mechanical properties. Papers not presenting quantitative results were excluded. This process resulted in 344 relevant papers and the full texts were reviewed to identify reported laboratory experiments. For each of the 1313 identified experiments, the quantitative data was recorded in a database organized for the analysis. The following sections present the details of the screening process used in this paper. 2.1 Automatic search for publications The literature selection was conducted through an automatic search for publications in one of the most extensive abstract and citation databases of peer-reviewed literature (Scopus®, followed by a manual screening process based on the content of each publication. The search procedure was designed to return all articles and reviews published in peer-reviewed journals between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2020, written in English and including specific search terms (in the title, abstract or keywords field) addressing three dimensions: “materials”, “production processes” and “mechanical properties”. The “materials” dimension included the search terms “alumina”, “Al2O3”, “zirconia” and “ZrO2”, while “production processes” included search terms related to the target fabrication processes, namely CPP, CCT and AM. Finally, the dimension “mechanical properties” considered several search terms, e.g. “Vickers hardness”, “Young modulus” and “fracture toughness”. The literature selection was conducted separately for each production process through the following general full script. TITLE-ABS-KEY ((alumina OR al2o3 OR zirconia OR zro2) AND PROCESS AND (mechanical-properties OR structural-properties OR density OR vickers-hardness OR young-modulus OR fracture-toughness OR bending OR flexural OR \"coefficient of thermal expansion\" OR thermal-conductivity OR weibull OR \"elastic modulus\" OR \"modulus of elasticity\")) AND DOCTYPE (ar OR re) AND SRCTYPE (j) AND LANGUAGE (english) AND PUBYEAR > 1999 AND PUBYEAR < 2021 The variable PROCESS was replaced by search terms associated with each production process, according to Table 1 . The literature search was narrowed to “uniaxial pressing” and “isostatic pressing” for the CPP processes, and to “slip casting” and “gel casting” for the CCT processes. The AM literature search was organized into AM categories, with search terms including full designation and initials aiming powder- and suspension-based AM processes, namely Binder Jetting (BJ), Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), Direct Energy Deposition (DED) as mainly powder-based categories and Material Jetting (MJ), Vat Photopolymerization (VP), Material Extrusion (ME) and Sheet Lamination (SL) as mainly suspension-based categories. A general AM search (G) with the broad term “Additive Manufacturing” was also conducted as, currently, this designation is more established, although “Additive Manufacturing” and “3D printing” are still used interchangeably in many publications. Finally, the broad terms “alumina toughened zirconia” or “zirconia toughened alumina” were also considered to ensure that literature referring to ATZ or ZTA and no other manufacturing process was included. Table 1 also shows the number of publications resulting from the automatic search per production process and category. 2.2 Manual selection of publications The initial 1706 papers were manually screened in two consecutive steps: title/abstract evaluation and full-text reading. The screening process aimed at the selection of publications focusing on the analysis of dense ceramics, produced from materials solely based on alumina, zirconia and/or their mixtures, and including quantitative results on the mechanical properties of the produced ceramics. In the first step, the title/abstract content of each publication was analyzed independently by more than one reviewer (in most cases 3). A publication was excluded when all reviewers agreed that it did not attend, at least, one of the above-mentioned criteria. Most of the publications excluded by title/abstract were either i) studies not including any quantitative results on mechanical properties, ii) rheological studies of suspensions without characterization of ceramic sintered parts, iii) analyses of porous structures or core ceramics, iv) analyses focusing solely composites between alumina and/or zirconia with other materials (e.g. carbon nanotubes, titanium oxide, among others). The latter cases were considered for full-text reading whenever abstract gave evidence that composites were compared with pure ceramics (Al2O3, ZrO2, ZTA or ATZ). In the second step, all papers selected by title/abstract were accessed to exhaustive full-text reading and selected, if attending all the inclusion criteria. At the end of the screening process, 344 publications were selected to feed the database that supported the quantitative analyses presented in this paper (see Table 1 for the distribution among production process and category). Each experiment was organized as an independent entry in the database, even if reported in the same publication. All experiments were introduced by one reviewer and double-checked by another, to ensure the fidelity of the reported data. The database compiled a total of 1313 experiments/entries that were classified according to CPP, CCT and AM manufacturing processes and corresponding categories. As presented in Table 2 , the number of entries in each process sums up 455, 499 and 359, respectively for CPP, CCT and AM. For CPP, Uniaxial Pressing (UP) contributes with more entries than Cold Isostatic Pressing (CIP) and many entries are associated with processes combining UP and CIP (UP + CIP). For CCT, the number of Slip Casting (SC) entries is higher than that of Gel Casting (GC) entries, although coming from a similar number of papers. Finally, the AM categories contributing with most entries are VP, ME and PBF, and AM suspension-based processes (MJ, VP, ME and SL) have more entries than AM powder-based (BJ, PBF and DED). 2.3 Data retrieval The experimental conditions and the corresponding measured properties were registered for each identified experiment. The variables characterizing the conditions included particle size of the raw material (PS, alumina and/or zirconia, μm), sintering temperature (ST, °C), sintering holding time (t, h), ZrO2 and Al2O3 volume ratios in the mixtures (respectively ZrO2% and Al2O3%, vol%) which sums 100 % for each experiment, as well as the amounts of yttria or other stabilizing agents used in the raw zirconia powder (being the most common zirconia doped with 3 mol% yttria). For CPP techniques that used granules instead of powders, the PS recorded referred to the particle size of the raw material used for granule fabrication and not the size of the granules. For CPP and CCT processes, the additional use of specific processing conditions, e.g. Cold Isostatic Pressing (CIP), Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) and Microwave Sintering (MwS) was also recorded. The conditions “ST” and “time” respected HIP, when it was used instead (or after) conventional sintering step. Specific experimental conditions for each process were also included, such as the solids loading in suspensions (sloading, vol%) for CCT and some AM techniques, the pressure applied (Pressure, MPa) in UP, CIP and HIP and the nozzle diameter (ND, mm) used in AM processes. When applicable, organic additives used in the processing (Additives) were also reported for gel casting and AM technologies. The properties of the produced ceramics were registered through the mean, the standard deviation and the number of repetitions (sample size) to measure the property when the information was available and clear in the screened publication. The quantitative performance of materials included relative density (RD, %), linear shrinkage (LS, %), volume shrinkage (VS, %), grain size (Gr, μm) as well as mechanical properties, e.g. Young’s modulus (E, GPa), flexural strength (FS, MPa), fracture toughness (KIc, MPa.m1/2) and hardness (H, GPa). This work used the designation KIc for fracture toughness, instead of K1c [29], as KIc was more often referred among the entries of the final database. The quantification method was also registered for each property, e.g. for flexural strength (3-point or 4-point testing [30], respectively 3pt and 4pt) and Young’s modulus (Impulse Excitation Technique, IET, Berkovich indenter and others [31–33]). Concerning hardness, the method (Vickers and others [34,35]) and indentation load (IL, N) were registered, being Vickers the method most used to access this property (in 610 entries out of the 642 reporting H). It is worthwhile to mention that experimental conditions and properties are reported in different ways all over the literature (e.g. mixture ratio either in weight % or volume %), if not incomplete, which difficult the comparison between results from different publications. In this paper, the variable values of many entries (if reported in the screened publication) were converted into the above-mentioned physical units. E.g. ZrO2 and Al2O3 mixture ratio values reported in weight were converted to volume percentage (vol%) by using 6.05 g.cm-3 and 3.95 g.cm-3 as the theoretical density for zirconia (usually stabilized with 3 mol% of yttria) and alumina, respectively. The same theoretical density values were used to calculate the relative density (RD, %) in the sintered alumina, zirconia or alumina/zirconia materials when the data given in the paper was only bulk density (g.cm-3) measured by Archimedes’ method. 2.4 Visualization and data analysis The data were visualized through boxplots, showing the minimum/maximum values and the first/third data quartiles (in the extremities of the central box), and the median of the data (solid black line inside the central box). The width of the central box corresponds to the interquartile range (i.e. the difference between the third and the first quartile) and is a measure of dispersion based on the 50 % most central values. Outliers were identified as observations more extreme than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the first/third quartiles and represented as isolated black dots. This rule fairly identifies the points more extreme than 3 times the standard deviation from the mean, assuming a Normal distribution for the data being represented. When the sample size is ≤5, the boxplot is omitted and the median is displayed instead, to avoid misleading interpretations. Along with the text, the results are presented in terms of mean ± standard deviation (s.d.) and sample size (n), either reported in one research paper or obtained by aggregating several database entries. Dedicated visualization tools and all statistical analyses were implemented in MATLAB (version R2020a, © 1994-2020 The MathWorks, Inc.) and in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 27, © IBM Corporation). 3 Structural performance of alumina/zirconia dense ceramics: overall literature results Fig. 1 displays the distributions of the values that allow the characterization of the materials produced in the 1313 database experiments. This representation includes several properties, namely relative density (RD), flexural strength (FS), fracture toughness (KIc), hardness (H) and Young’s modulus (E), as well as the grain size (Gr) as a microstructural feature. The values are shown as a function of the volume proportion of alumina (0 % ZrO2) and zirconia (100 % ZrO2) in the mixture, regardless of the manufacturing technique and other processing conditions (e.g. amount of stabilizing agent in zirconia, raw particle size, sintering temperature and time). From a general perspective, and considering only the median values, the results are in good agreement with several literature statements for these oxide ceramics. Although showing similar median RD values, alumina (0 % ZrO2 vol%) exceeds zirconia (100% ZrO2 vol%) ceramics in terms of hardness (H) and Young’s modulus (E). There is also a higher variability in these values for alumina when compared to those for zirconia. Both properties (H and E) are highly dependent on the final microstructural features, including grain size (Gr) that also presents a high range of values for alumina ceramics in comparison to zirconia, being alumina Gr usually higher than zirconia (Fig. 1). The small grain sizes in zirconia-based ceramics are strongly associated with their importance in stabilizing the tetragonal phase, improving toughness and flexural strength [36]. Additionally, the variability observed for all mechanical properties for all materials can also be explained by the high inconsistency of processing conditions used in the different literature reports dealing with different shaping techniques, namely particle sizes of raw materials, sintering temperatures and holding time; these influences will be detailed in the next section. Zirconia is a high crack-resistant material, i.e. with high fracture toughness (KIc), presenting typically higher median FS values when compared to alumina (Fig. 1). These excellent properties are a characteristic of ZrO2 tetragonal polycrystal and are due to the transformation toughening, where crack propagation is inhibited by a stress-induced tetragonal-to-monoclinic (t → m) phase transformation accompanied by an expansion of unit cell volume of approximately 4-5 % [29,30]. In recent years, many efforts have been made to improve the toughness of ZrO2 ceramics [37] due to its growing interest in dentistry applications [38,39]. Pure zirconia presents a monoclinic (m) crystal structure thermodynamically stable at room temperature and pressure. Increasing temperature, the material transforms to tetragonal (t) structure by approximately 1170 °C and cubic (c) around 2370 °C [29]. These lattice transformations are martensitic involving a shape deformation, i.e. volume changes on cooling enough to make the pure material unsuitable for applications that require an intact solid structure [40]. So, among the three ZrO2 polymorphs, tetragonal (t-ZrO2) and cubic (c-ZrO2) zirconia have more relevant applications than monoclinic (m-ZrO2), being the tetragonal one categorized by its high fracture toughness and the cubic one by its ionic conductivity [41]. To retain tetragonal and cubic phases at room temperature, lower valence oxides (also known as stabilizing agents or dopants, such as CaO, MgO, CeO2 or Y2O3) have been explored [4,36,42–44]These tetragonal and cubic phases are characterized by the replacement of some of the Zr4+ ions in the crystal lattice of zirconia by the slightly larger ions of the dopants presenting also a fraction of oxygen sites vacant to retain charge neutrality stabilization [40]. Due to its excellent performance, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is the most extensively used in the literature reports [4,23,41,42,45–164]. Therefore, the features of YSZ strongly depend on structural and phase changes with respect to the Y3+ addition amounts, being corroborated by Y2O3–ZrO2 phase diagrams that tetragonal zirconia is stabilized for low contents of Y2O3, whereas excess Y2O3 additions yield tetragonal and/or cubic ZrO2 mixtures at elevated temperatures [36,41]. The amount of Y2O3 dopant required for full cubic stabilization (also known as full stabilized zirconia, FSZ) is around 8 mol%, with one oxygen vacancy created for every two yttrium ions, while partial stabilization of tetragonal zirconia (partially stabilized zirconia, PSZ) can occur at dopant concentrations around 2-5 mol%, depending on the grain size [40]. Stabilized tetragonal ZrO2 polycrystal with 3 mol% Y2O3 (3Y-TZP), which could contain up to 98 % of the metastable tetragonal phase after sintering and grain sizes lower than 0.3 μm, is the most extensively commercialized powder and consequently the highest explored in zirconia-related research. This fact is corroborated by the information in the database. Out of the 404 zirconia entries, 356 report the amount of zirconia dopant and 3 mol% Y2O3 is used in 231 entries [23,42,45,46,51–63,67,70–77,79,80,83–96,98–115,118,119,121–123,126,130,131,133,142–151,153,154,156,162]. In fact, 3Y-TZP presents a unique combination of Young’s modulus, hardness, flexural strength and fracture toughness, resulting in a ceramic with outstanding mechanical strength (aka ceramic steel) able to compete with titanium alloys in certain applications [4,41]. Moreover, 22 entries consider < 3 mol% [125,127,159–162,164,165], 47 are in the ]3,5] mol% interval [48,49,63,82,93,116,117,129] and 56 entries make use of a dopant amount > 5 mol% [110,124,137] up to exactly 8 mol% (49 entries) [68,120,130,132,139,140,145,152,155,157–159]. Although, fully stabilized cubic zirconia with 8 mol% yttria (8YSZ) combines a set of good properties (e.g. high ionic conductivity, high thermal and mechanical stability) that makes it an interesting material to be used as a solid electrolyte in fuel cells (Solid Oxide Full cells, SOFC), its poorer mechanical properties, mainly fracture toughness, limit its application in in-service situations where high mechanical stresses are applied [120,132,152,158]. All the above-discussed specificities for zirconia ceramics help to explain the high variability of the literature results displayed in Fig. 1, concerning e.g. FS (3pt and 4pt) as well as KIc for zirconia (100 ZrO2 vol%), as the results are here represented regardless of the type and the amount of dopant, if used. The mechanical performance of every single material, alumina or zirconia, could be improved through the formation of composites containing both materials in proper ratios, as supported by the results displayed in Fig. 1. Two composite materials inside the ZrO2-Al2O3 system have been studied, namely, zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) and alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ), for which fracture toughness is expected to increase in comparison with that of the pure materials, alumina or zirconia [149,166]. The combination of a hard ceramic material, such as Al2O3 with a high toughness ZrO2 matrix (ATZ, 80 ≤ ZrO2 < 100 vol%), can produce a reinforced composite with distinctive enhancement in KIc, H and E (see Fig. 1). Oppositely, the addition of zirconia as a reinforcement material in an alumina matrix (ZTA, 0 < ZrO2 ≤ 20 vol%) could result in dissimilar improvements in KIc and FS (see Fig. 1). Other composites containing zirconia proportions of 20 < ZrO2 < 80 vol% have also been analyzed in the literature, generally addressed as ZTA when alumina is in the highest amount when compared to zirconia, and ATZ in the reverse situation. As illustrated in Fig. 1, these Al2O3-ZrO2 compositions (]20,80[ ZrO2 vol%) present increased median values of H and E when compared to zirconia (100 ZrO2 vol%), while median FS is significantly increased when compared to alumina (0 ZrO2 vol%). Therefore, the amount of zirconia and alumina to be added to the composites depends on the target property. There is no optimum combination: small amounts of zirconia should be added if a maximal hardness is required while, on the contrary, a higher concentration of zirconia should be used if maximal bending strength and a high threshold for fatigue crack propagation are required [167–169]. The database reports a total of 249 entries related to ZTA experiments (0 < ZrO2 ≤ 20 vol%) obtained from 65 research papers [51,52,54,55,66,69,72,74,87,99,122,126,147–149,154,168–213], 47 entries related to ATZ experiments (80 ≤ ZrO2 < 100 vol%) obtained from 18 manuscripts [43,60,61,67,70,74,86,87,92,122,147,149,165,168,214–217] and 147 entries associated with composites in the range of 20 < ZrO2 < 80 vol%, obtained from 46 literature papers [51,53,57,60,61,67,72,74,85,87,92,104,122,126,148,149,154,165,168,169,171,192,193,196,206,212,218–236], where the most common mixture considered 72 vol% of ZrO2 (36 entries out of 147). Almost all entries reported RD in the final material characterization, as corroborated by the similarity between the number of entries reported in Fig. 1 and the total number of entries, for each composition. Two basic concepts are mentioned in the literature to attain improved mechanical properties in alumina/zirconia composites [166,212,237,238]. One is related to regulating particle size, particle morphology and location between zirconia and alumina grains in the microstructure, which induces microcracks during cooling and thus increases the material toughness [41,212]. This is highly explored in ZTA ceramics, where the stability of the tetragonal phase when alumina is mixed with zirconia does not primarily involve the use of dopants but instead is controlled by the particle size [41]. Some authors mention that in ZTA ceramics containing up to 10 vol% of zirconia, the effect of the alumina matrix is sufficient to keep zirconia grains tetragonal if zirconia is homogeneously dispersed and does not exceed the critical size of ∼0.5 μm [212]. However, since it improves essentially toughness, using only the particle-size-related concept is not enough when flexural strength is also an important property for the required application. Bending strength and fracture toughness in zirconia/alumina composites can also be enhanced by dispersing small metastable tetragonal zirconia particles that can be transformed to the monoclinic phase in front of advancing cracks, impeding crack growth when exposed to stress. Both volume expansion and shear strain, associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation, result in various toughening mechanisms in these composites (including stress-induced transformation toughening, microcracking toughening, compressive surface stresses and crack deflection) [41,166,237–239]. Furthermore, resultant microstructures influence significantly the mechanical properties of the composites, being possible to observe from Fig. 1 that, in general, alumina exhibits higher grain sizes than zirconia. Alumina grain size tends to be reduced in the presence of zirconia for all alumina/zirconia ratios since it is well-known that zirconia controls grain growth of alumina [168,170,174]. Owing to their properties, ZTA ceramics are suitable for a variety of highly demanding applications including dental screws, cutting blades, electrosurgical insulators, valve seals, body armour, pump components, oxygen sensors, dies, and prosthesis components such as hip joints [240]. Regarding ATZ composites (zirconia matrix with alumina particles, i.e. [80,100[ ZrO2 vol% class), alumina provides high hardness, while tetragonal zirconia also applies a toughening impact, on account of its controlled change into the monoclinic phase. Despite the t → m phase transformation around the crack formation as the primary toughening impact, other systems can also contribute to improve this property, such as microcracking, crack deflection and bridging in a good similarity of ZTA ceramics [57,67,149,166,171]. Microcracking is favoured in ATZ due to the zirconia expansion during cooling, leaving a system of micro-cracks in the alumina network, which empowers high strength [57,67,174,237,241]. ATZ is highly used in structural ceramic applications (e.g. wear parts and cutting tools), being also progressively selected for biomedical applications (namely femoral heads), since its quality and toughness, tribological properties and biocompatibility are favouring implants’ lifetime [57,149]. Once again, stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal with 3 mol% of Y2O3 (3Y-TZP) is extensively used in both ZTA and ATZ ceramic composites (~60 % of the database entries associated with mixtures), although some authors report that optimal properties are observed for zirconia doped with 1 and 2 mol% of yttria [164,167,168,198,207,212,232,235,239]. Besides the composition and features of raw materials, also processing conditions influence the densification behaviour of the ceramic material in straight connection with microstructure (grain shape, size and distribution) and inherent impact on the final structural and mechanical performance. The fundamental studies for alumina and zirconia presented in the literature deal with samples synthesized at a laboratory scale, which show different results according to process conditions, i.e. powder-based or suspension-based shaping processes that strongly influence powder packing and, thus, final part density. Additionally, several sintering conditions have been explored with a strong impact on the microstructure and ceramics densification. The situation is even worse in the case of ZTA and ATZ ceramics, where the structural and mechanical properties of these composites are strongly dependent on the zirconia/alumina particles’ homogeneity, particle size, microstructure, grain size, sintering aids/stabilizers, different fabrication routes and sintering conditions [67,149]. The following two sections present the results and main concerns found in the manufacture of dense alumina, zirconia or mixtures of both ceramics by conventional processing techniques (CPP and CCT) and AM. 4 Interdependencies between manufacturing techniques and mechanical performance in alumina/zirconia dense ceramics Regardless of the final application, ceramic components need to be shaped by a processing methodology. These methodologies can be classified into dry or wet shaping technologies, even though both started from an initial ceramic powder. The goal of the shaping process is to obtain a green ceramic powder compact that is then sintered to achieve the desired final material. Up until now, shaping processes have been developed and optimized aiming to be cost-effective, reproducible, with tight tolerances and able to produce ceramic components without any defects. Moreover, the best-suited production technology selected for a certain product depends on the required functional properties for the target application, including shape, geometry and size of the part, if bulk or hollow, porous or dense, among other factors. In the present review, three main ceramic shaping routes have been considered as the most representative in the literature to produce dense alumina and zirconia ceramics, namely (i) Conventional Powder Pressing (CPP) including uniaxial and isostatic pressing as dry-based manufacturing technologies; (ii) Conventional Colloidal Technologies (CCT) including slip casting and gel casting as wet-based methods and (iii) Additive Manufacturing (AM) enclosing powder- and suspension-based categories. To access the current R&D status of AM processes concerning the fabrication of ceramics based on alumina, zirconia or their composites (while highlighting their strengths and present weaknesses), it is mandatory to provide an overall picture of the most established shaping routes first – the conventional ones. The following section presents the results collected from the literature for conventional dry- and wet-based processing techniques. 4.1 Conventional processing techniques This section presents an overview of the conventional (more established in literature) fabrication processes in technical ceramics based on alumina, zirconia and their composites. The discussion is supported by the database information concerning the processing conditions and the resulting properties of the produced materials. 4.1.1 Conventional Powder Pressing (CPP) Powder pressing is a conventional forming technique in which dry powders are compacted (usually in metallic moulds to form simple shapes) and the resulting shape is then submitted to a sintering step (with proper conditions of heating rate and maximum temperature depending on the material). The CPP techniques are considered the easiest procedures in ceramic production and thus are widely used to produce simple geometries. In this process, powder processing settings (milling, particle size distribution, homogeneity, applied pressure), composition and sintering schedule are parameters that should be kept into consideration to produce defects-free ceramic parts [242]. The CPP process is also known as dry pressing to emphasize that the powders are in the “dry” state, although a small amount of moisture or binder addition is usually added to help the compaction of the powders (typically 1 to 5 wt%, based on powders amount). Alternatively, powders granulation before pressing is also used to improve powders’ handling, flowability, homogeneity of all constituents (binders, sintering aids, particle sizes) and, consequently, to enhance compaction and pressing performance. Several types of pressing processes can be distinguished based on how the load is applied to the powder/granules; examples of those are uniaxial pressing and isostatic pressing. Uniaxial pressing (UP) is usually the first step that involves filling the die cavity with powder, followed by load application in one direction. Cold Isostatic pressing (CIP) is usually used after UP to improve the consistency of the material, by applying uniformly the pressure in the powder compact via a liquid that surrounds the deformable mould. Both UP and CIP are often combined with a subsequent green machining process to achieve the required complex geometry. Because of that, the remarkable disadvantages of this shaping method are related to its limitation for simple shapes, as well as the wastage of valuable material, as high amounts of material must be removed to achieve the desired shape [7,124,218,243]. To ensure the proper structural properties of the final ceramic parts obtained by dry-powder pressing, additional high-tech sintering procedures, such as Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) and Microwave Sintering (MwS) can be used. These procedures have been highly applied in alumina, zirconia or alumina/zirconia composites [42,64,91,120,131,148,164,165,173,197,198,211,212,229,231,235,239,242,244–249]. Since sintering is a highly energy-consuming step and a huge determinant of the final ceramic properties, research has tried to find the best trade-off between sintering conditions and final properties [36]. 4.1.2 Conventional Colloidal-based techniques (CCT) The colloidal processing routes enable good particles’ packing ability, enhancing the sintering ability at lower temperatures, avoiding coarsening of the sintered microstructure and thus improving the material performance reliability [250,251]. In these processing methods, the ceramic powders are suspended in a liquid solution (usually an aqueous medium), to generate a stable and deagglomerated suspension to cast in a mould. The preparation of suspensions is the starting point of several colloidal-based processes, such as Slip Casting (SC) and Gel Casting (GC). In SC, the suspension is poured in a typical porous plaster mould, where a particle’s layer on the inner walls of the mould is formed due to their water suction capacity. This suction causes movements of ceramic particles inside the liquid medium, usually causing particles’ segregation during layer deposition. Contrarily, in GC, the suspension is cast into a non-porous mould with a subsequent formation of a tri-dimensional network promoted by a gel system, i.e. the dispersing medium is solidified via a gelation system (chemically- or thermally-induced) according to the gel former [252]. In this way, the ceramic particles are entrapped, and both the homogeneity and the quality of the suspensions are preserved in the green piece. Acrylamide-based systems have been the most explored solutions as gel formers (n=112 database entries) [95,117,126,127,130,151,177,187,188,194,213,226,236,253–265], although epoxy-based systems (n=14) [59,266–268], natural polymers such as polysaccharides (n=37 entries) [84,150,269–276] and other thickening agents, including IsobamTM (Isobutylene polymer, Kuraray, Japan) have also been considered (n=58) [265,277–288]. Find non-toxic gelling agents that could reach the same casting behaviour and final properties of the ceramic parts have been the main driving force to go for natural materials. Although GC already achieved research feasibility at the technology readiness level, its use in the ceramics industry is not highly explored. The toxic nature of most of the gel formers (acrylamide-based, epoxy-based), casting operations, drying, storing conditions and associated process costs are some parameters that could explain the difficulties in the scalability of this technique to the industry. 4.1.3 CPP vs CCT Table 3 resumes the mean and standard deviation values obtained from all the database entries regarding experimental conditions and material properties (relative density and mechanical), distinguishing CPP and CCT shaping procedures that use conventional sintering and excluding those applying HIP. Note that the CPP and CCT related entries are respectively 335 and 492 (Table 3), which supports the research trend in conventional fabrication by colloidal-based techniques with a good trade-off between shape feasibility and complexity with concurrent proper mechanical properties. The most studied materials have been pure alumina (0 ZrO2 vol%, n=293 entries) [51–53,72,74,85,87,99,122,126,148,149,154,169,172,176,182,192,193,200,202,205,206,242,244–249,253–262,265–286,288–320] and pure zirconia (100 ZrO2 vol%, 268 entries) [42,52–56,58–61,64,67,69,72–94,99,117,120,122–131,133,137,147–165,216,264,321,322] in comparison to their composites (in a total of n=393 entries for all classes) [43,51,52,54,55,57,60,67,72,74,85–87,99,147–149,154,165,168–179,188–209,211,212,214–216,218,226,229–236,239,253,271,319], with the following number of entries per material and technology group: alumina (103 CPP and 190 CCT), zirconia (134 CPP and 134 CCT) and alumina-zirconia composites (218 CPP and 175 CCT). Regarding the Al2O3-ZrO2 composites (see ]0,20]; ]20,80];]80,100] ZrO2 vol% classes in Table 3), UP, UP + CIP, and SC have been the highly explored techniques, whereas there were no results reported for the ]20,80] class produced by GC. The relative density is the property mostly reported in the literature for alumina- and zirconia-based materials produced by CPP and CCT conventional techniques, with a total of 817 entries out of 827 (approx. 99 % reporting). Concerning the mechanical performance of the sintered materials, flexural strength (3pt or 4pt), hardness and fracture toughness are the most reported properties, while Young’s modulus is only reported in just a few entries/papers. Processing conditions According to Table 3, mean RD values for zirconia ceramics obtained by CPP vary between 93.8 and 98.6 % while, for CCT, mean RD values vary between 94.9 and 97.1 %. Regarding alumina ceramics, the mean RD range is 93.6-97.8 % and 96-96.4 %, respectively for CPP and CCT procedures. These results highlight RD differences among the different processes as well as a large RD variability among the database entries. Subsequently, RD impacts the mechanical performance of the resultant materials, being both are directly related to the processing conditions, namely particle size of raw materials (PS). According to the database, zirconia PS between 0.003 and 2.25 μm have been used for CPP processing (n=151 entries), with 26 entries showing PS > 0.5 μm [61,133,142,150,186,187,190,194,214,225] while, for CCT processing, zirconia PS varied between 0.006 and 5 μm (n=269 entries), with 14 entries reporting zirconia PS ≥ 1 μm [54,91,248,259]. Regarding alumina, CCT experiments were based on PS varying between 0.044 and 7.530 μm (n=327), where most of the experiments considered PS in the [0.3,0.6] μm interval (n=213, Table 3). The mean PS and high standard deviation presented in Table 3 for alumina powders used in UP process results to the literature work from Alias et al 2019 [248], where the authors studied the influence of using different PS (namely 25.0, 45.0, 63.0 and 90.0 μm) in the final microstructure of the sintered samples. To have a more accurate comparison between the processing variables used in CPP and CCT for alumina, zirconia and their mixtures, Fig. 2 shows the distribution of PS for alumina and zirconia raw powders in the different compositions, sintering temperature (ST) and holding time (t), considering only the entries with a relative density of the final ceramics above 98 %. Concerning PS, the literature highlights that zirconia often presents values in nanometric range and alumina in micrometric size. This is clearly shown in Fig. 2 by comparing the PS Al2O3 and PS ZrO2 boxplots, for a given composition, and observing that the median PS values tend to be much smaller for ZrO2 than for Al2O3. However, the pairwise comparison between CPP and CCT boxplots, for a given ZrO2 (vol%) content, shows different patterns both in PS ZrO2 and PS Al2O3. Distributions of the PS Al2O3 values are similar in CPP and CCT, except for pure Alumina (0 ZrO2 vol%), for which the CPP distribution exhibits a higher median and a higher variability than that for CCT. Concerning PS ZrO2, the CCT medians tend to be higher than the CPP medians for the mixtures with ZrO2 > 20 %. Note that, for these mixtures, the CCT medians for PS ZrO2 and PS Al2O3 are similar, whereas the CPP medians in PS ZrO2 are lower than those in PS Al2O3. For the pure materials (alumina or zirconia), the PS ZrO2 median is fairly lower than the PS Al2O3 median for the CPP processes whereas, on the contrary, the PS ZrO2 median is slightly higher than the PS Al2O3 one for the CCT processes. Besides the PS of the raw materials, other variables related to the processing conditions, such as load pressure, maximum temperature, atmosphere and time in the sintering step can determine the RD values. Fig. 2 shows that sintering temperature and holding time are experimental parameters more dependent on the material rather than the consolidation technique, being ST generally higher for alumina, and for composites rich in alumina (1500-1600 °C) than for zirconia (1400-1550 °C). Fig. 2 also shows that the sintering time of 2 hours corresponds to the median value among all ceramic materials (alumina, zirconia, or their composites). For example, in alumina ceramics produced by CPP, only 20 % of the database entries (15 out of 76) used temperatures ≤ 1500 °C [149,169,200,242,245,298–300], being the average holding time between 2-3 h, while only 1 database entry reported 9 h [200]. In zirconia produced by CPP, out of 100 entries, 81 % used sintering temperatures ≤ 1500 °C [50,52–54,60,61,64,81,89,91,93,94,120,129,131,133,137,147,149,156–163,184,323], whereas the remaining 19 % used ST > 1500 °C [51,55,61,67,72,76,79,85,92,99], with average holding time of 2 h. The quite large variability in sintering conditions for zirconia experiments produced by CPP or even CCT could be associated with the amount and nature of stabilizing agents used in these ceramics. In fact, several manuscripts studied the optimal conditions to attain high densities [51,64,81,89,94,149,157,159,163,180,189,191,199,200,203,204,234,245,248,300,308], whereas other studies have been focused on decreasing the sintering temperature of a certain material or optimizing several parameters in the powders compaction [129,204,230,308]. As an example, Fu et al. 2014 [300] varied UP and CIP pressures load and sintering temperatures in the fabrication of alumina by CPP and analyzed the final properties. The RD was 81 % when using UP and CIP pressures load, respectively, of 50 MPa and 150 MPa, and 1500 °C as ST. Increasing UP to 100 MPa and ST into the range 1560-1580 °C (maintaining CIP pressure load at 150 MPa), the RD increased to 98 % [300]. Schaffoner et al. 2018 [308] investigated, for the first time, the use of cycling CIP to fabricate coarse-grained alumina refractories by applying either an increase in the pressure cycle or constant cycling at maximum pressure. Although the RD values were not higher than 80 % (an expected result due to the large size of the raw alumina particles), the authors concluded that cyclic pressure slightly increases apparent density, while cycling at maximum pressure decreases the average pore size. On the other hand, the authors showed that an optimized particle size distribution results in less porosity and in a decrease in pore sizes, which increased Young’s modulus. More recently, Drazin et al. 2020 [129] demonstrated the possibility to produce zirconia dense ceramics stabilized with 4 mol% yttria (4YSZ) via dry CIP at lower sintering temperatures and using particles with nanometre size. The authors showed that the use of CIP pressures higher than 500 MPa effectively removed pores larger than 100 nm and that the pressureless sintering can occur at lower temperatures (1100-1200 °C). 4YSZ samples with an RD of 94.5 % were attained for 4 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (4YSZ) when sintered only at 1100 °C during 2 h. By keeping the sintering temperature at 1100 °C and increasing time up to 4 h or increasing the temperature to 1200 °C and shortening time down to 0.2 h resulted in ceramics with RD around 97 % and 96 %, respectively, with grain sizes in the order of 30-34 nm [129]. Similarly, Freitas et al. 2020 [230] developed an ATZ composite from nano-scale powder mixtures using low-sintering temperatures with a 2 h holding time. The conventional powder mixture achieved densification at 1600 °C while the nano-sized powder allowed to attain full dense samples at 1400 °C. 4.1.3.1 Mechanical Properties Fig. 3 presents the boxplots for several materials properties, namely flexural strength (FS, 3pt), Young’s modulus (E), hardness (H), fracture toughness (KIc), as well as alumina and zirconia grain sizes (Gr) as a microstructural feature, as a function of the ZrO2 (vol%) content in the mixture, considering also the database entries with relative density above 98 %. Although it was expected that CCT techniques resulted in enhanced packing density and, consequently, in better mechanical properties, when compared to CPP for the same ceramic material, this is not clear for any of the properties reported in Fig. 3. Instead, CPP technologies seem to be those achieving better properties, although showing high variability, in particular for FS. According to Fig. 3, zirconia database entries (100 ZrO2 vol%) with RD ≥ 98 % present median FS values around 750 and 1000 MPa (3pt for CPP and CCT), Young modulus around 200 and 220 GPa and median KIc around 5 and 10 MPa.m1/2, respectively for CPP and CCT processes. Hardness values are very similar for both processes with median values around 13 GPa. Considering alumina database entries (0 ZrO2 vol%) with RD ≥ 98 %, median values of FS are ≈ 500 MPa and 300 MPa, Young’s modulus ≈ 380 GPa and 350 GPa and hardness ≈ 18 and 16 GPa, when CPP and CCT have been used, respectively. Furthermore, for alumina, KIc median values exhibit a small difference between processes, being in the 4-5 MPa.m1/2 range. Regardless of the process, compared to pure alumina, FS and KIc are the mechanical properties that highly benefit from the addition of zirconia (]0,20[ and ]20, 80] ZrO2 vol% composition classes), while Young’s modulus (E) and hardness (H) improve when alumina is added to pure zirconia. These statements are also in good agreement with the results presented in Fig. 1. In fact, CPP technologies have progressed over time by using homogeneous powder mixtures in granule shape before pressing [51,52], usually attained by granulation technologies that benefit from the liquid dispersion of the powders. This fact supports the similarity or even the better properties attained by CPP in comparison with CCT and, simultaneously, highlights the importance of powders packing and the homogeneity in the final properties of the sintered ceramics. As an example, Ganesh et al. 2011 [51] prepared alumina-zirconia composites with relative densities in the range of 96-98 % by UP of freeze-dried granules, being the granules obtained from a well-dispersed and stabilized suspension containing 35 vol% of the solid’s mixture. Besides freeze granulation, spray drying is another way to obtain feedstock for CPP processes [99,168]. Recently, Hohne et al. 2020 [52] reported ultrasound atomization as an advanced spray granulation process to obtain alumina, zirconia and ZTA granules with proper properties for pressing (size distribution, homogeneity, flowability). Using 100 MPa as uniaxial pressure, RD values of 98.9 % and 99.8 % were obtained for alumina and ZTA composites sintered at 1580 °C for 1 h, respectively and RD of 99.1 % for zirconia sintered at 1500 °C for 0.5 h. Additionally, grain size, grain size distribution and size homogeneity are microstructural features that can influence the mechanical performance of the final materials. As observed in Fig. 3, for a given composition, the median grain size is similar for the different processing methods (CPP and CCT). For all compositions and processing methods, the variability on grain size among entries is small, except for the size of alumina grains in pure alumina ceramics (0 ZrO2 vol%) for both CPP and CCT methods. Comparing the grain size of alumina and zirconia, the results are consistent with the particle size of raw materials, i.e., smaller median grain sizes are observed for zirconia. Median Gr values of alumina are in the range of 0.5-1.8 μm for all compositions, while median Gr values of zirconia are around 0.5 μm. 4.1.3.2 Slip casting and gel casting Comparing slip casting (SC) and gel casting (GC) from CCT techniques for a given material, similar final mechanical properties have been reported in the literature since both techniques can benefit from the use of high-concentrated colloidal-based suspensions. Both techniques have RD values exhibiting lower dispersion (i.e. generally lower standard deviations, Table 3) when compared to the CPP processes. For all SC studies, PS of alumina and zirconia raw powders was lower than 1 μm, and only 3 entries reported particles with a size in the range 1-1.4 μm (one alumina entry in the work by Cho et al. 2020 [311] and two zirconia entries with particle sizes in the range 1-1.9 μm reported by Hassanin et al. 2013 [78]). For all GC studies, 10 entries reported the use of alumina raw powders with a size larger than 1 μm (in the range 1-7.5 μm) [187,253,254,258], while 12 entries used zirconia particles in the range 1-5 μm [117,253,324]. The literature supports that, in both SC and GC processes, proper particle packing combined with high stability of the suspension throughout time is extremely important to avoid particle segregations and consequently cracks occurring during the drying step [75,250,325]. Stability and high solids loading in suspensions are also crucial to achieve high structural performance after sintering, usually obtained by the addition of dispersants [75,250,325]. From the database and for all materials (alumina, zirconia and composites), 157 entries used suspensions with solids loading ≥ 50 vol% in GC [121,126,130,187,188,194,213,226,253,254,257–264,266–269,271–288,306,307,309,310], while only 16 entries with solids loading ≥ 50 vol% were found in SC [78,218,289,291,293,295,312,315]. Suspensions with solids loading ≤ 30 vol% (79 database entries for SC and GC, all compositions) are usually associated to nanometric particle sizes, since it is more difficult to disperse powders with high surface area, turning to high shrinkage values [74–77,79–84,88,123,125,127,128,150,174,178,290,304,312,315,317,321,326]. Although SC could benefit from the absence of organic additives during the sintering step when compared to GC, the green packing homogeneity preserved in GC could be a distinctive gain. This advantage can be particularly valuable in the processing of powder mixtures, such as ZTA or ATZ composites. As an example, Olhero et al. 2009 [218] prepared two different zirconia-alumina composites (70 wt% Al2O3 + 30 wt% ZrO2 and 40 wt% Al2O3 + 60 wt% ZrO2) by different techniques including SC and GC. For the same ZTA composition, the samples consolidated by GC and sintered for 1 h at 1600 °C had their alumina and zirconia grains uniformly distributed over the composite, which improved the mechanical properties in particular flexural strength, in comparison with those consolidated by SC. Likewise, Zhang et al. 2012 [208] obtained ZTA ceramics with a mass ratio of 3:1 (Al2O3:ZrO2) by acrylamide-based GC. The sintered samples (at 1600 °C for 2 h) presented an RD around 98.5 %, 643.3 ± 75 MPa as bending strength and 6.3 ± 0.3 MPa.m1/2 of fracture toughness. Abbas et al. 2015 [177] prepared ZTA samples (around 83 vol% and 17 vol% as alumina and YSZ proportions) reaching maximum RD around 99.1 %, maximum hardness 1902 HV, fracture toughness 5.43 MPa.m1/2 and flexural strength around 618 MPa when sintered at 1650 °C for 2 h. Osmotic drying and high solids loading in suspensions (62 vol%) were highlighted as the main benefits to achieve such properties. Disadvantages resultant from the binder burnout of organic additives in GC are also pointed out to explain the deterioration of the final structural properties of alumina- and zirconia-based ceramics. As an example, Liu et al. 2014 [59] prepared zirconia samples by GC using an epoxy resin and hardener as gel-forming agents. The zirconia solids content and epoxy resin varied between 30 to 45 vol% and 15 to 30 wt%, respectively. After sintering at 1550 °C for 2 h, RD was not higher than 90 %, which could be attributed to defects generated during the drying step and difficult burnout, due to the presence of organic compounds. The use of natural polymers as gelling agents, such as polysaccharides (agarose, carrageenan, arabic gum) rather than acrylamide-based and epoxy-based systems also started to be explored in the early 2000s. Santacruz et al. 2005 [273] used agarose as gel former (natural gel casting) to prepare high concentrated alumina suspensions (50, 55 and 57 vol%) leading to RD values higher than 99 % when sintered at 1500 °C for 2 h [273]. Zhang et al. 2014 [271] prepared alumina suspensions containing 55 vol% solids loading with optimized amounts of gellan gum and achieved sintered bodies (1550 °C for 2 h) with RD around 98 % and bending strength of approximately 330 MPa. Zhang et al. 2014 [271] prepared alumina suspensions containing 55 vol% solids loading with optimized amounts of gellan gum and achieved sintered bodies (1550 °C for 2 h) with RD around 98 % and bending strength of approximately 330 MPa. As in CPP processing, several reports also evaluate the effect of sintering temperature and time in the final density of ceramics obtained by CCT, which explains the high standard deviations in ST presented in Table 3, for alumina (0 ZrO2 vol%) and zirconia (100 ZrO2 vol%) made-up by SC. As an example, Abi et al. 2013 [176] dispersed alumina in an aqueous medium using HCl to stabilize a suspension with 43 vol% of solids. When the slip casting samples were sintered at 1400 °C for 2 h, only 90 % of RD was attained, while increasing sintering temperature to 1600 °C, RD increased up to 95 %. Ramesh et al. 2000 [87] prepared alumina-zirconia ceramics by slip casting using suspensions with 45 vol% solid content and 0.1-0.2 wt% (related to solid content) of polyacrylate as the dispersant. Three sintering temperatures were tested (1450, 1500 and 1550 °C), and the lowest RD values (81-89 %) were found for samples rich in alumina and sintered at 1450 °C. By increasing ST to 1500 and 1550 °C in similar samples, RD enhanced to values in the range of 94-100 %. 4.1.3.3 Influence of HIP Finally, Table 4 presents the same results as in Table 3 for the database entries that used HIP as the additional high-tech sintering procedure. As expected, there is a much lower number of entries reporting the use of HIP when compared to conventional sintering (CS), in a total of 127 entries (Table 4) against 827 entries for CS (Table 3). Being a time-consuming and expensive process, HIP is not extensively applied. Literature revision brings evidence that the use of HIP is more common in CPP technologies (total of 120 entries) than in CCT (total of 7 entries in SC and no entries in GC). For CPP, 27 entries have been collected for alumina, 34 for zirconia and 59 for composites, where most of the composites are processed solely by HIP (“Others” class in CPP). For a given material, sintering temperature in HIP processes (Table 4) tends to be lower than in CS (Table 3), although the material is commonly subjected to two sintering steps, one as CS at a higher temperature and a lower holding time and then the HIP step conditions. PS of zirconia raw powders are in the range [0.01,0.07] μm (n=57) in both processes CCT (n=3) and CPP (n=54), while alumina PS are in the interval [0.1,12.73] μm (n=113, with n=7 for CCT). The 9 database entries presenting PS > 1 μm [247,248], explains the high mean and s.d. values for 100 % alumina (0 vol% ZrO2) obtained by UP + HIP (Table 4). According to the results presented in Table 4, regardless of the shaping technology, the use of HIP in sintering leads to RD values higher than 99 %, with consequent improvements in mechanical properties. Flexural strength and fracture toughness are the structural properties where high improvements are noticeable for zirconia and composites rich in zirconia ([80,100[ ZrO2 vol%). Zirconia ceramics obtained by CPP techniques present mean FS around 850 MPa (Table 3) while FS values higher than 1300 MPa can be obtained with HIP (Table 4). As an example, Hu et al. 2018 [64] attained 3pt FS of 1780 MPa for zirconia stabilized with 3 mol% Y2O3, in a sample with 99 % of RD and 0.138 μm of average grain size in the final microstructure, by pre-sintering the samples in an oxygen atmosphere at 1275 °C for 2 h and HIP at 1450 °C for 4 h under an argon pressure of 200 MPa. Fracture toughness of zirconia could be improved from mean values around 7 MPa.m1/2 (Table 3) up to 10 MPa.m1/2 (Table 4, [165]). For alumina (0 ZrO2 vol%) and composites rich in alumina (]0,20] ZrO2 vol%), the reported average values for H in CPP samples are in the range 15-17 GPa (Table 3) and increase to the order of 19 GPa when HIP is used (Table 4, [212,239]). The same trend is noticeable for SC samples when HIP is applied after shaping, even if for a small number of entries [86,305,313]. Although enhancements were also expected in Young’s modulus, this property was reported only in one paper that used CIP combined with HIP in alumina, leading to an average of 398.0 ± 4.1 GPa (n=4) (Table 4, [246]). However, this value is larger than that obtained for the 3 alumina database entries using CIP and not HIP showing an E of 360.7 ± 8.1 GPa (n=3) (Table 3, [294]), thus supporting the expected trend on Young’s modulus. 4.2 Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques According to the current ISO standard, AM comprises seven categories based on feedstock state (powder, liquid, suspension or sheets) and the deposition method [327,328]. Table 5 presents a general overview and classification of these AM categories, including BJ (a liquid bonding agent that is selectively deposited to join the powders), PBF (thermal energy selectively fuses regions of a powder bed), DED (focused thermal energy is used to fuse materials by melting), MJ (droplets of build material are selectively deposited), VP (liquid photopolymer in a vat is selectively cured by light-activated polymerization), ME (material is selectively dispensed through a nozzle or orifice) and SL (sheets of material are bonded together to form a 3D object). Table 5 includes the reference to the technologies highly used in ceramic materials, within each AM category, arranged into powder- and suspension-based technologies (according to the form of feedstock material). In this topic, it is worthwhile to mention that the categories initially developed aiming solely at powder processing, namely BJ and PBF, have now been opened to include suspension-based procedures in their processing routes, such as Layer-wise Slurry Deposition (LSD) and Suspension-based Selective Laser Sintering (S-SLS, or Suspension-based indirect Laser Sintering, S-iLS) [329,330], trying to mimic the good properties of the final materials produced by suspension-based technologies. Table 5 also resumes some of the advantages and disadvantages of each AM category, based on key features such as the ability to produce complex parts, mechanical properties of the final material, surface finishing, manufacturing costs and amount of material waste. The success of these AM techniques to produce ceramic materials is based on the feedstock material form, energy source and material deposition process, which are factors that highly influence the surface finishing, printing resolution and resultant mechanical properties of the final parts. On the other hand, in the ceramic parts construction via AM techniques, an anisotropic behaviour is implicit and, sometimes, the complexity of physical phenomena involved can limit the potential to produce high strength materials, being necessary to control and optimize patterns, properties’ variation, and the in-service behaviour of the produced components. The AM categories presented in Table 5 can also be classified into direct, including DED and a direct PBF technique, Selective Laser Melting (SLM), or indirect processing (including BJ, indirect PBF, MJ, VP, ME and SL) [27], depending on if a single-step or a multi-step procedure is involved to obtain the final component. Indirect processing is the most used since most of the AM techniques use a sacrificial binder material to shape the part and require post-processing steps such as de-binding and sintering. As all categories and technologies have been deeply discussed in previous review papers [12,15,16,27], this paper presents just a brief description of the technologies highly prone to dense ceramics fabrication. Binder Jetting (BJ), initially named 3D printing and now aka powder-based BJ, was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 80s. In this process, 3D structures are constructed by droplets deposition of a liquid binding agent onto a powder bed of a ceramic powder, usually with coarse particle size [332]. The binder penetrates the powder bed by capillarity joining the ceramic particles and, in this way, forming a pattern with the required shape. BJ has been highly explored for plaster material as moulds or parts, often requiring post-processing to improve the desired strength or final characteristics [254,333]. The slurry-based BJ appears to introduce the advantages of colloidal ceramic processing into the technology [27,331]. Layer-wise slurry deposition (LSD) is a suspension-based BJ technology developed by a research group at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) in Germany [329], which is based on the spreading of a ceramic slurry employing a doctor blade instead of using a dry powder. The ceramic slurry contains small amounts of alginic acid sodium salt that is crosslinked by jetting a binder solution consisting of copper sulfate pentahydrate dissolved in ethylene glycol. Less porosity and, consequently, better mechanical properties have been appointed as the main advantages of LSD when compared to powder-based BJ [329]. Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) encompasses indirect powder-based Selective Laser Sintering (P-SLS, also known as P-iLS) technology and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) as single-step or direct powder bed fusion technology [27,331]. In P-SLS, the ceramic powder is mixed with a low melting point binder phase (polymeric or inorganic) and a local sintering of the mix is performed through melting of the binder by the laser beam. The binder provides a solid matrix upon re-densification of ceramic powder, ensuring the layer-by-layer formation of a green body that needs to be subsequently sintered. In the case of SLM, a laser selectively scans a powder bed layer-by-layer to fuse the material, to obtain sintered ceramic parts in a single step. Here, it is the ceramic material itself rather than a low melting point binder that is sintered/melted by the laser beam. The surface roughness of the ceramic parts, the high energy-consuming and the thermal stresses caused by the deposition of the cold layers of powder on top of the preheated powders have been appointed as the main weaknesses of these technologies. Suspension-based indirect laser sintering (S-SLS or S-iLS) includes the Ceramic Laser Sintering (CLS) technology developed by Tang et al. 2006 [334]. This technique uses a paving device that enables the deposition of a slurry containing finer ceramic particles suspended in a liquid carrier. It was first developed to build ultra-thin layers from aqueous-based colloidal suspensions containing silica, silica sol, and volcanic clay as an inorganic binder (low melting point). Later on, Tang et al. 2011 adapted this technology to produce dense alumina ceramics [330]. Since P-SLS is more explored than S-SLS in ceramics, it is common to use only the SLS terminology, which is usually associated with powder-based selective laser sintering. The main technology used in ceramics from Direct Energy Deposition (DED) category is Laser Engineering Net Shaping (LENS), a single-step AM technology [335]. In the LENS process, the powder is supplied coaxially to the focus of a high-power laser beam, where a molten pool is subsequently formed on the substrate. Fast deposition and required minimal materials pre-processing are appointed as the main advantages. As in SLM, high thermal gradients and extremely fast cooling rates result in the development of thermal stresses, which usually induce delamination and cracking in ceramic materials. Material Jetting (MJ) is a suspension-based AM category where Inkjet Printing (IJP, also referred to as Direct Inject Printing, DIP) is the widespread technology for ceramics, namely prototypes, providing an excellent level of details, high accuracy and smooth surface finish in the parts. IJP disposes of two liquids, i.e. the ceramic particles with the photopolymer liquid and the support liquid, being the ceramic part constructed by thin layers of droplets cured by UV light [336]. Due to the very small volume of the feedstock material (ink/suspension) used in the current commercial printers, this technique is limited to print miniaturized ceramic parts, being mostly explored for porous alumina ceramics [16] with just a few results for high-density structural ceramics [337,338]. Another technology belonging to the MJ category is Pressurized Spray Deposition (PSD) developed by HotEnd Works LLC (Ohio, USA), where the slurry formulation is heated and pressurized for spraying deposition and the binder co-deposited from a second nozzle as the support material [27,339]. Vat Photopolymerization (VP) is another AM suspension-based category highly used in ceramics, invented in the early 1980s by Japanese and French researchers [340–342]. Current VP technologies highly used in ceramics include Stereolithography (SLA) and Digital Light Processing (DLP) [343], both relying on a similar operation principle, i.e. use of light, typically in the UV region of the spectrum, to cure a photosensitive viscous resin loaded with ceramic particles. The main SLA and DLP differences count on the printer’s design and light projection. While SLA makes use of a laser to deliver a concentrated amount of light in each spot of the resin’s monomers to induce photopolymerization, DLP is not restricted to a single spot and the entire layer is formed at once. Beyond SLA and DLP, different names and abbreviations are used for VP technologies in ceramic materials, including the Lithography-based Ceramic Manufacturing (LCM) introduced by Schwentenwein and Homa 2015 [344], a commercial DLP technology developed by Lithoz GmbH [27,345]. The great benefits of these technologies are the high printing resolution and excellent surface finishing, imperative for the fine details in ceramic parts. In Material Extrusion (ME) category, the 3D parts are constructed layer-by-layer from continuous material extrusion, which is selectively dispensed in the specific and desired coordinates through a nozzle or an orifice. Extrusion-based methods are known for their simplicity and low-cost fabrication. The processing simplicity and low manufacturing costs together with small amounts of organics needed and reduced material wasted during the processing are the key features of its popularity. The ME category includes Fused Deposition of Ceramics (FDC), also known as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), where the ceramic particles are dispersed into a thermoplastic (or wax) material to form a filament. Layer by layer, the flexible filament is partially melted and extruded through a moving deposition head onto a static worktable. Another extrusion method highly popular in ceramics is the Robocasting (RC) (aka Direct Write Assembly, DWA or Direct Ink Writing, DIW), patented by Dr. Cesarano and Prof. Calvert in 2000 [346]. It is based on the printing of slurry-based inks or pastes, typically containing high loads of ceramic particles dispersed in liquid medium (usually aqueous) with low-binder contents when compared to FFF or even SLA/DLP techniques. The ceramic inks should present specific rheological properties, namely shear-thinning behaviour to guarantee a continuous flow through the nozzle and viscoelastic properties to assure weight support of filaments during printing. Upon deposition, the ink should present excellent shape recovery capacity, retaining the extruded shape meaning a typical solid-like behaviour with high elastic/storage modulus [347]. Polymeric and thermo-curable additives are usually used to attain this proper rheological behaviour during printing and to avoid deformations throughout the ME process. More recently, other variants of extrusion-based techniques have been developed based on an intermediate step of layer consolidation, such as the Ceramic On-Demand Extrusion (CODE) [143]. In this technique, the ink is extruded on a tank with paraffin/oil to preclude undesirable water evaporation in the printed part, and the oil level is controlled during the printing process to reach just the top surface of the last deposited layer. Then, infrared radiation is applied to dry the last layer uniformly, repeating the process until print the full piece, followed by a drying step at controlled conditions and finishing with a sintering step. The advantages of this technique are shared with Robocasting, namely (i) the possibility to use fine ceramic powders that facilitates the sintering process, (ii) high solids loading paste resulting in a dense green body, (iii) printing at room temperature, and (iv) partial drying during the printing process, precluding cracks formation and enabling strong bonding between layers [12,27,110]. Oppositely, two main limitations have been recognized in both Robocasting and CODE techniques, namely significant staircase effect and difficulty in fabricating fine features in complex parts. Finally, Sheet Lamination (SL) encompasses Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) technology, developed in the 1980s by Helisys Corporation. This technology allows the production of objects from sheets as feedstock, usually green tapes produced by tape casting, in the case of ceramics. Ceramics LOM works by sequentially stacking, cutting and bonding these tapes to form the required shape. Although it is a very low-cost process with little post-processing and no support structures being required, SL is limited in the production of complex overhangs structures, where high amounts of wastes not reusable/recyclable are produced from the material that is removed in each layer during fabrication [348,349]. On the other hand, the main downside of SL is the presence of interfacial discontinuity and defects leading to delamination, differential shrinkage and interfacial porosity, which preclude the choice of this technology to attain high-density ceramics [27]. In the fabrication of dense bulk alumina- and zirconia-based ceramics, all categories have been studied with high emphasis for the powder-based category PBF and suspension-based categories VP and ME (recall the number of database entries per AM categories presented in Table 2). As evidenced by the literature search supporting this paper, SL is not a popular AM technology to produce alumina- or zirconia-based dense ceramic materials (only 1 entry in the database in 2001) due to the above-mentioned reasons. 4.2.1 Mechanical performance by powder- and suspension-based AM technologies Similar to the conventional consolidation techniques, AM technologies can be divided into powder- and suspension-based, by taking into consideration the form of the feedstock material (see Table 5). The bulk solid-based methods as FFF were included in the suspension-based group, since the fabrication of the filament (feedstock) involves dispersing the powders in a polymeric dispersion medium, namely a wax-based system. Similarly, the SL category is here considered as suspension-based since the green sheets as feedstock (fabricated by tape casting) are usually prepared in a liquid binder carrier. Following the results already presented for CPP and CCT, Table 6 shows the overall properties of the final materials produced by AM taking into account the reported experimental conditions, distinguishing the powder- from the suspension-based entries of the database. There is a total of 359 AM entries, from which 2 are associated with AM fabrication combined with HIP. For the non-HIP entries, Table 6a reveals that AM suspension-based techniques, highly comprised in VP and ME categories, have been vastly studied in the fabrication of dense alumina, zirconia, or even ZTA/ATZ composites fabrication. There is a total of 240 suspension-based entries [45,56,62,96,97,100–104,106–108,110,132,143,294,344,347,349–358], 229 of which report RD, 122 report FS (3 or 4 pt), 111 report H and 73 KIc. For the same materials, AM powder-based technologies collected a total of 117 entries [63,70,113,114,116,136,140,141,184,210,220–225,227,324,333,359–374], associated with experimentation in BJ, PBF and DED categories. From this total number of entries, 99 reported RD, while only 32, 36 and 23 entries have reported FS, H and KIc, respectively. These numbers are following represented in Fig. 4 . Similar to CPP and CCT techniques, Young’s modulus is the mechanical property fewer times reported in AM manuscripts. The previous numbers evidence that slurry-based AM technologies have been preferred to powder-based AM in the fabrication of technical ceramics. As a matter of fact, the AM fabrication of ceramic parts using powders as feedstock typically results in less dense ceramics, explaining the choice for other alternatives when the production target is functional ceramics, where high density and enhanced final properties are crucial. This is highlighted with the median RD values presented in Fig. 5 , for the comparison between powder-based (blue colour) and suspension-based (pink) AM technologies with the corresponding conventional processes (CPP and CCT). The RD differences among AM and conventional processes are highly pronounced for alumina or zirconia ceramics, rather than for the composites (for which fewer results are presented in literature). Mean RD for alumina and for zirconia obtained by AM powder-based is, respectively, 70.3 ± 19.6 % (n=59) and 74.6 ± 19.6 % (n=34) while, for AM suspension-based, the corresponding values are 90.6 ± 13.4 % (n=110) and 96.0 ± 5.8 % (n=96). Concerning alumina/zirconia composites, both powder- and suspension-based AM presented high RD values with low standard deviations estimated from a much lower number of experiments (total of 31 entries for all mixtures). As previously mentioned and, in good agreement with the literature results for CPP and CCT technologies, densification behaviour is related to the sintering conditions as well as to the PS of raw materials. According to Table 6a, the average PS of raw powders used in powder-based AM technologies is, in general, expressively higher than those used in suspension-based AM, for a given composition, which explains the lower average values of RD, FS and KIc obtained for powder-based AM materials. It should be noted, however, that the standard deviation of PS is particularly large for powder-based AM techniques (ranging from 16.77 to 33.37, Table 6a) evidencing the existence of experiments using atypical PS values. Given the (larger) sample size, the attention in the PS analysis is focused on PS used in pure alumina and zirconia experiments. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the PS values per process and per mixture, in a PS axis that is zoomed in the [0,5] μm interval. Regarding the powder-based AM processes, there are 13 entries (n=58) with PS Al2O3 values between 8 and 74 μm [333,359,369,372,374,375] and 17 entries (n=33) with PS ZrO2 values between 14 and 60 μm [116,136,140,256], not shown in Fig. 6. These atypical values impact differently in the PS Al2O3 and PS ZrO2 distributions for the pure materials produced by powder-based AM technologies. In particular, the average and the median differ substantially for PS Al2O3 while, for PS ZrO2, they are similar. Thus, even if the standard deviation is high for both PS Al2O3 and PS ZrO2 (Table 6a), the interquartile range (a measure of dispersion based on the 50 % most central data) is much smaller for PS Al2O3 and as large as for PS ZrO2 (Fig. 6) than the corresponding standard deviations. Finally, when compared to CPP, the PS Al2O3 (PS ZrO2) values tend to be lower (much higher) for the pure materials produced by powder-based AM technologies (Fig. 6). Regarding the suspension-based AM technologies, both PS Al2O3 and PS ZrO2 show typically lower averages and lower standard deviations across compositions when comparing to powder-based AM entries (Table 6a). Also, these descriptive measures are more in accordance with, respectively, the medians and interquartile ranges (Fig. 6). This concordance is due to the lower number of entries with atypical PS values, exhibiting lower (discrepant) values. As an instance of that, and focusing on the pure materials, there are 7 entries (n=94) with PS Al2O3 values between 6 and 11 μm [343,376–378] and solely one entry (n=56) with PS ZrO2 equal to 44 μm [379]. Finally, when compared with CCT, the PS Al2O3 (PS ZrO2) values tend to be higher (lower) for the pure materials produced by suspension-based AM technologies (Fig. 6). Considering temperature and time conditions, in general, mean values are similar to those used in CCT and CPP (Table 3) and likewise more dependent on the material composition than on the AM processing methodology used. Also, for a given composition, mechanical properties attained by suspension-based AM are closer to the mean values reported for CCT techniques (Table 3), even if exhibiting high variability (which is deeply discussed in Section 4.2.2). Fig. 7 compares the flexural strength (the most reported mechanical property in AM) obtained in powder-based and suspension-based AM ceramics with the conventional processes (CPP and CCT). As expected, FS values are lower for powder-based than for CPP, even if just a few powder-based AM papers report FS for alumina or zirconia. There were no FS values in powder-based AM entries for the alumina/zirconia mixtures. The scenario is different when comparing the FS values obtained from suspension-based AM and CCT processes. Besides being more times reported (in comparison with powder-based processes), the FS values attained for AM-suspension are closer to those obtained for CCT, for a given material. The highest suspension-based AM and CCT difference is observed for pure zirconia ceramics, also exhibiting a high variability in the observed FS values. These results can be driven by the nature and the amount of stabilizing agents used in the processing. As above-mentioned, cubic zirconia stabilized with 8 mol% Y2O3 (8YSZ) usually presents lower FS and KIc values, when compared to partially stabilized tetragonal zirconia. To corroborate this decrease in performance with the database, some of the results presented in Table 3 and Table 6a were recalculated by ignoring the 8YSZ entries (49 out of 1313 entries). These entries correspond to the production of 100 % ZrO2 ceramics and not applying HIP in the production process: 8 entries in CPP [120,157,159], 27 in CCT [120,130,152,155] and 14 in AM [68,132,139,140,145]. When removing the 8YSZ entries, FS (4pt) changed from 553.2 ± 221.4 (n=8) to 652.7 ± 144.7 MPa (n=6) and KIc changed from 4.3 ± 1.0 (n=33) to 4.5 ± 1.0 MPa.m1/2 (n=27) in the suspension-based AM entries (Table 6a). Despite the small number of 8YSZ AM entries, the 8YSZ impact is clear for AM processes as for both FS and KIc, the average increased while the variability decreased for FS. The same trend is observed for the conventional processing techniques (Table 3) e.g. where KIc changes from 5.4 ± 2.4 (n=9) to 6.8 ± 1.5 MPa.m1/2 (n=6) in CPP/UP and from 12.2 ± 7.5 (n=28) to 13.7 ± 7.0 MPa.m1/2 (n=24) in CCT/GC (Table 3). 4.2.1.1 Influence of HIP As previously referred and showed in Table 6b, the use of HIP was identified in two of the AM selected papers [370,380], one in powder-based AM (referred to alumina samples printed by SLS) and another in suspension-based AM (referred to Robocasting in alumina ceramics) (Table 6b). Liu et al. 2013 [370,380] introduced CIP and HIP in alumina parts produced by indirect SLS to improve final density. The authors prepared a granulated powder by spray drying using Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and epoxy resin as a binder phase for the SLS process. After printing, alumina samples (green parts) presented 32 % of relative density that increased to 52.4 % after CIP and, finally, attained 96 % after conventional sintering and HIP. This density value is the highest of the database for samples obtained by the indirect powder-based SLS technique. Mamatha et al. 2018 [380] produced alumina by Robocasting using methylcellulose and Poliethyleglycol (PEG) as thickening agents to prepare the extrudable paste. Pressureless sintered samples at 1650 °C for 1 h presented maximum RD of 98 % and 15 GPa of H, while HIPed samples exhibited RD around 99.7 % and 18 GPa of H, even at low temperature (1350 °C). Fine-grained microstructure, due to the enhanced diffusion caused by the pressure during HIP even at low sintering temperature and the flaws elimination have been appointed as the main reasons for the superior density and mechanical properties in printed samples by Robocasting using HIP in the sintering process. 4.2.2 Mechanical performance by AM categories and technologies The comparison between AM categories starts by exploring the values of the most reported variable among literature experiments, i.e. the RD of the final materials. Fig. 8 displays the RD values obtained for alumina, zirconia and their composites produced from several AM technologies. There are 172 and 136 database entries, respectively for dense alumina and dense zirconia ceramics, in which 168 and 130 report the RD values. Overall, Fig. 8 shows that zirconia ceramics exhibit a higher median RD value than alumina ceramics for all categories. Concerning the different AM categories, BJ and PBF exhibit the lowest median RD values while DED, VP and ME exhibit the highest, for both materials. Also, the RD distribution for BJ, PBF and MJ-based experiments exhibits the highest variability for alumina when compared to zirconia. Finally, there are 50 entries concerning alumina and zirconia mixtures, 31 of which report RD values for PBF, DED, VP and ME-based experiments. Alumina/zirconia composites are less studied in AM, without entries for BJ or MJ. The sample median RD values are above 95 %, except for the single entry in ME for which the RD was 85 % (mixture in ]20,80[ ZrO2 vol%, see Table 7 ). Complementary to the previous representations, Table 7 resumes the experimental conditions (PS of raw materials, ST and t) as well as the relative density and mechanical properties for the database entries for the different AM categories and technologies. The mean PS of raw materials used in BJ, PBF and DED categories (predominantly powder-based) is larger than that used for the remaining AM categories (most suspension-based), which is in good agreement with the powder versus suspension comparison presented in Table 6. Regarding ST, AM processes use higher temperatures for alumina (or compositions rich in alumina) than for zirconia, similarly to the CCT and CPP trends (Table 3), emphasizing that AM is following the knowledge acquired in the conventional processing related to the sintering ability of alumina- and zirconia-based materials. BJ and PBF are also the AM categories where the mechanical characterization of the printed samples is highly scarce. This scenario is analogous for all other AM categories (see Table 7), being FS the highest reported mechanical property (153 out of 358 AM entries) with a high number of entries in VP (76 out of 140 VP entries) and ME (35 out of 72 ME entries) for all studied materials. As for CPP and CCT entries, Young’s modulus (E) is the least reported property in AM studies (34 out of 358 AM entries). To examine the reported results and related strategies that have been used to improve the performance of final AM ceramics, a more detailed description by category and respective technologies, supported by the results presented in Fig. 8 and Table 7, is following presented. 4.2.2.1 Binder Jetting Concerning the BJ category, the 29 database entries are concentrated in single-component materials. In the 17 alumina entries only 3 reported FS, 2 reported H and 2 reported E, while 9 out of 12 entries in zirconia characterized FS of the final ceramics, without any entries for other properties (H, E and KIc). With respect to the number of entries per technology in the BJ category, 27/29 of the entries are related to the BJP technology [113,333,360–362,372] and only 2/29 are LSD based experiments [329], which results explain the higher variability in RD observed for alumina than for zirconia (Table 7). The larger RD dispersion observed for alumina (71.5 ± 18.6 %, n=17, Table 7) is due to a few experiments leading to very low RD values of the final materials (58.9 ± 6.5 %, n=4) when using large Al2O3 raw-particle sizes (40 μm) to form the main structural component [333]. When alumina nanoparticles (PS < 50 nm) suspended in the printing liquid medium were used to incorporate this component to fill the inter-particle pores, the RD values increased. However, RD was not higher than 66 % for the highest nanoparticle concentration tested (15 wt%) [333]. On the other hand, high RD values were obtained both from LSD, with the suspension-based BJ technology (99.1 ± 0.6 %, n=2) [329], and from BJP, with the powder-based BJ technology (achieving 94.5 % by using PS of 0.3 μm and 16 h of sintering holding time) [362]. The (small) variability of BJ experiments observed for zirconia is obtained from 12 zirconia BJ entries that come from one single paper [381], studying different sintering temperatures (1400, 1500, 1600 °C) and using different additives. In that paper, Huang et al. 2019 [381] developed a novel inorganic colloidal binder from zirconium basic carbonate, as it easily decomposes by heat to form zirconia particles. This approach was compared to the conventional Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) binder, which usually causes nozzle clogging problems. The results show that the final RD of the printed parts was not higher than 65 %, even when sintered at 1600 °C, although the average RD value was shown to be higher for the inorganic (56.9 ± 5.6 %, n=6) than for the PVP binder (51.4 ± 4.8 %, n=6) [381]. 4.2.2.2 Powder Bed Fusion For the PBF category, the results in Fig. 8 were already showing a quite large RD variability for the alumina experiments, which is partially explained by the variability observed among PBF technologies. As presented in Table 7, SLM and P-SLS technologies have been quite explored in ceramics (with, respectively, 18 and 42 entries out of the 61 PBF entries). As there is just 1 entry with an S-SLS experiment, the results of this PBF technology are not presented in Table 7. Concerning the mechanical characterization of alumina ceramic parts produced by PBF, 15 out of 37 entries reported FS and just one measured H. In zirconia, 4 out of 21 entries presented H, without reference to other mechanical properties. Since the powders are fully melted in SLM, superior mechanical properties are usually achieved with this technology when compared to SLS (see e.g. the H values for zirconia in SLM and P-SLS, Table 7). In accordance with this trend, SLM entries exhibit higher mean RD values in comparison with P-SLS experiments (Table 7), for alumina ceramics [141,324,364,365,367–371,382], zirconia ceramics [114,116,141,324] and mixtures of both [225]. Different strategies have been developed to attain complete powders melting in the SLM technique. Recently, Florio et al. 2019 [365] used SLM to produce alumina parts from alumina granules (as starting powder) doped with a small quantity of iron oxide (hematite), achieving RD values of 96.2 ± 0.5 % (n=18) and an average biaxial FS of 25 MPa with a maximum value of 38.1 MPa (n=8) (results on the biaxial flexural test are not presented in Table 7 due to the low number of database entries recorded for this property). On the other hand, Jan Wilkes et al. 2013 [225] developed alumina-zirconia ceramic parts (41.5 wt% zirconia and 58.5 wt% alumina, mixture ratio close to the eutectic point) from SLM (presented in [80, 100[ ZrO2 vol% class in Table 7), by melting completely the ceramic powders with the laser beam, attaining ~100 % for RD and 356 ± 182 MPa for biaxial FS (not shown in Table 7). This paper concluded that the use of a zirconia and alumina mixture has advantages when compared to the use of single-component materials, as a fine-grained eutectic microstructure can be obtained while preheating the powders to at least 1600 °C avoids crack formation [225]. Regarding P-SLS, organic and inorganic binder agents have been approved to form a liquid phase and to promote the diffusion and migration of ceramics, being the main concerns of high shrinkages and porosities on the final parts. Verga et al. 2020 [220] developed ATZ parts via P-SLS, where the powder was produced via a spray drying process and the laser-matter interaction was enhanced by binder pyrolysis. Relative densities around 90 % were achieved, although together with low FS values (31 MPa, n=1, 4pt bending test, [80,100[ vol% ZrO2 in Table 7). To overcome the low density and poor mechanical properties of ceramic components prepared by P-SLS (see Table 7 for details), post-processing methods (infiltration/isostatic pressing) have also been used. For example, Shahzad et al. 2014 [141] reported results on SLS of spherical polypropylene–zirconia composite powder using yttria-stabilized zirconia powder with nanometre size (30 nm). Homogeneous spherical composite powders in the form of microspheres with good flow characteristics were prepared, although the final sintered RD of the produced parts was around 36 % of the theoretical density. The RD increased to 54 % after infiltration of the previously printed samples with a zirconia-based aqueous suspension. Alternatively, Warm Isostatic pressing (aka WIP) was also applied to the printed samples without and with post-processing infiltration (with settings 135 °C and 64 MPa), allowing to increase RD after sintering to 92 % and 85 %, respectively [141]. The authors concluded that high-density samples presented cracks in the cross-section, while the combination of infiltration and WIP allowed producing crack-free samples, but with densities not higher than 85 %. As already mentioned in Section 4.2.1, the combination of CIP and HIP as post-processing methods was also explored in alumina parts printed by SLS, reaching 96 % of RD [370]. Finally, the suspension-based variation of SLS (S-SLS) (not displayed in Table 7) has shown the potential to produce high RD alumina ceramics (98.0 % for 1 entry) [330] by using submicron alumina powders (average size 0.5 μm) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as sacrificial polymer binder. Firstly, fully hydrolyzed water-insoluble PVA was coated onto alumina particles. A slurry containing the coated alumina particles, water-soluble PVA as the binder, ammonium polymethacrylate as a dispersant and deionized water as suspending medium was prepared and sequentially paved, dried and laser-scanned. Both types of PVA react with laser irradiation, forming a water-insoluble mixture that bound the alumina particles. After sintering at 1600 °C for 2 h, printed parts presented a mean FS of 363.5 MPa, comparable with FS values attained for alumina by CPP or CCT techniques [330]. 4.2.2.3 Direct Energy Deposition The DED category presents entries solely based on LENS technology experiments that lead to the highest RD values among all AM categories and materials [136,184,210,221–224,227,359,363,373,374,383]. For certain materials, the values obtained for H and KIc (see Table 7, DED category) are comparable with those obtained by CPP and CCT (Table 3), while the FS values are still lower. The first report on LENS related to functional ceramics was presented by Balla et al. 2008 [363], where alumina parts were produced with cylinders, cubes and gear shapes achieving 94 % RD after fabrication. RD increased up to 97 % and 98 % when the alumina components were then submitted to a post-processing heat treatment at 1100 °C and 1600 °C during 5 h holding time, respectively. This is the only report where heat treatment after sintering in a direct AM technique was used, corresponding to the values reported as 1300 °C mean ST in Table 7. Niu et al. 2018 [359] claimed for the first time the possibility to obtain large-sized Al2O3 ceramic components by LENS with relative densities around 99.5 % and average flexural strength of 210 MPa. Besides pure alumina, effects of doping agents, such as TiO2 to obtain Al2O3/Al2TiO5 composite ceramics or even zirconia to obtain ZTA ceramics, have been the recent trends in this technique [383]. Recently, Pappas et al. 2020 [184] studied the doping effects of zirconia on laser-direct-deposited alumina ceramics. The authors concluded that the increase in zirconia content follows a greatly reduced critical flaw size, improving substantially flexural strength from 58 MPa (for the pure alumina samples) to 208 MPa (for samples printed with 10 wt% zirconia), while RD is around 96 %. 4.2.2.4 Material Jetting The database entries for the MJ category are distributed among IJP [45,48,56,139,337,338,384,385] and PSD [339] technologies, respectively with 23 and 2 entries out of 25 (Table 7). RD values around 95-96 % have been reported for zirconia printed by IJP [45,56,139]. For alumina, the RD has a lower average and higher variability (76.3 ± 21 %, n=18, Table 7) since, in most alumina studies, RD values did not exceed 90 % [338,384]. In accordance, FS reported for zirconia presents comparable values with those in CPP and CCT (Table 3) while, for alumina, the average FS is quite lower. The research developed in this topic [45,56] advocates that the properties of the fluid, determined by solids loading and PS of the raw powders, and accurate drop placement are important requirements to successfully manufacture ceramic parts by IJP. Ebert et al. 2009 [45] demonstrated the possibility to fabricate zirconia (3Y-TZP) with high strength (763 MPa) and toughness (6.7 MPa.m1/2) for dental applications by using a zirconia-based ceramic suspension with 27 vol% solid content with 90 nm particle size and a modified drop-on-demand inkjet printer. The authors integrated a tailored cleaning unit into the printer, which allows for longer printing periods without nozzle clogging. However, the microstructures of the printed and sintered samples were not completely free of process-related defects, presenting RD values lower than 96.9 % [45]. Özkol et al. 2012 [56] applied the DIP/IJP to fabricate 3Y-TZP parts by an aqueous ink containing 40 vol% of particles with 0.63 μm mean size. Relative densities around 96 % and flexural strength ∼843 MPa were reported for the printed and sintered specimens. With respect to alumina, Muniz et al. 2019 [338] studied the effects of using different binders (namely polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and arabic gum) on the structural properties of IJP parts, reporting RD values lower than 50 % after sintering at 1500 °C for 1 h, explaining the high variability of RD values in Table 7. Although proper solids loading in suspensions have been attained (45 vol%), both the high average PS of the alumina powder (3.68 μm) and the low ST could justify the low RD values obtained after sintering [338]. To overcome these drawbacks, sintering additives and additional CIP after printing have been reported as helpful procedures to achieve higher RD ceramics by IJP. As an example, Huang et al. 2020 [337] used a two-step sintering method (pre-sintering at 1150 °C and sintering at 1600 °C) and a precursor liquid infiltration treatment after pre-sintering to improve the density of the alumina parts printed by IJP. These actions allowed to attain a maximum RD of 95.2 % using a raw alumina powder with 5 μm mean particle size. 4.2.2.5 Vat Photopolymerisation As shown in Table 7, the VP category is the AM processing route with highest number of experiments reported in literature, with an overall number of 140 entries distributed as 79 entries for SLA [15,23,66,69,71,97,112,118,183,186,263,277,294,343,358,377,378,386–401], 58 for DLP [46,49,62,68,70,100,102–104,106–109,111,135,137,145,146,185,354,356,357,402,403] and 3 entries for LCM [98,228,344]. Since LCM has the basic principles of DLP, the results for the first technology are included in DLP in Table 7. As can be seen from Table 7, RD and mechanical properties reported for both SLA and DLP technologies are comparable with those attained by CPP and CCT techniques (Table 3). Furthermore, there are no relevant differences in the mechanical performance between the parts printed by SLA and DLP, due to the high similarity in the printing processing systems used in both technologies. Variability of RD for alumina parts (Fig. 8 and Table 7) is also smaller in VP when compared to BJ, PBF and MJ. The ceramic suspensions as feedstock for these technologies should include the photoresponsive components (organic matrix/resin) as the base matrix, to be polymerized upon absorption of a UV photon [404]. The incorporation of ceramic particles in this matrix usually decreases the photopolymerization reaction by scattering the UV light, and this effect is minimized when the refractive index of the ceramic filler is almost equal to that of the organic background. When the refractive index of the ceramic filler is superior, the UV light will be absorbed by the ceramic filler, reducing the curing depth. Similarly, ceramic particles with lower sizes reduce the light-curing reaction, due to scattering effects. Alumina and zirconia photosensitive suspensions for SLA/DLP technologies are already commercially exploited by several companies in the market, such as 3DCERAM (Limoges, France) and Sirris (Belgium), and these are commonly used as raw materials in some literature research [343]. Moreover, these technologies are well known for their excellent surface finishing and printing resolution in ceramics, difficult to attain by other AM technologies, with outstanding results for small reticulated alumina/zirconia pieces (complete piece not fully occupied with dense material) [12]. The scenario is different for full dense and large ceramic components. Because of the large amounts of organics (resin as photopolymer matrix), the printed components need to go through a slow and long de-binding step (to burn out the polymeric part) followed by a sintering stage (to achieve a proper structural resistance). Although this de-binding process could be easier in small and reticulated structures, it is critical for full dense and large parts, resulting in high cracks formation and distortions in final shape dimensions. Azarmi et al. 2019 [343] fabricated alumina parts from a commercial feedstock (3DCeram©). The organic component of the printed parts was burnout during 70-90 h at 1000 °C with subsequent sintering at 1200–1700° C for approximately 20 h, depending on the thickness of the samples. The resulting RD values did not exceed 95 % and no other mechanical properties have been reported. To fabricate a zirconia-based crown bridge model of a single missing tooth by SLA, Lian et al. 2019 [97] used suspensions with 40 vol% and 200 nm as the average particle size of zirconia powders and established 100 h for de-binding temperature profile. RD around 99 % was achieved after sintering the samples at 1500 °C for 1 h. Similarly, Xing et al. 2017 [390] prepared zirconia bars by SLA using a photosensitive acrylic resin suspension containing 55 vol% of ZrO2 particles with ~200 nm in diameter. The De-binding step was evaluated at 500 °C for 18 h followed by sintering at 1450 °C for 2 h, and produced zirconia bars with 99.3 % as RD, 1154 ± 182 MPa as FS, 6.37 ± 0.25 MPa.m1/2 as KIc, and 13.90 ± 0.62 GPa as H. Besides the duration of the de-binding process, other parameters, such as particle size of the ceramic powders and their volume fraction in the resin matrix, have been shown to influence the final density of alumina and zirconia ceramics produced by VP [100,377]. Wu et al. 2016 [377] suggested that the combination of a powder with a bimodal particle size distribution with a vacuum de-binding process, instead of traditional de-binding, offers an effective way to fabricate alumina samples by SLA. Jang et al. 2019 [100] evaluated the effect of volume fraction of zirconia suspensions in the microstructure and final properties of parts printed by DLP. Volume fractions in the range of 48-58 vol% were considered, being concluded that 58 vol% was the maximum possible for printing since the cure depth decreased as the volume fraction of zirconia particles increased. On the other hand, the number of cracks increased as solids loading of zirconia decreased, being attained a maximum 3pt bending strength of 674.74 ± 32.35 MPa for suspensions with 58 vol%, while RD was not higher than 93 %. Recently, Zhang et al. 2020 [62] tried to produce strengthened zirconia ceramics by DLP by introducing t-ZrO2 into m-ZrO2 as raw materials. The highest RD and 3pt FS attained were 96.4 % and 306.53 ± 6.03 MPa, respectively, when the tetragonal 3Y-TZP concentration was 7.5 vol% [62]. As expected, the authors concluded that FS was strongly dependent on the transformed amounts of monoclinic ZrO2. Besides the optimization of photosensitive suspensions’ features (e.g. composition and curing behaviour) and of de-binding and sintering conditions, additional procedures have been used to accomplish high density and high strength in bulk alumina or zirconia ceramics produced by VP. Some of these examples are microwave sintering [294], CIP after the de-binding step [354], liquid precursor infiltration [70] and different printing directions and/or geometry [387]. Besides pure alumina or zirconia, literature on the fabrication of alumina-zirconia composite ceramics by VP category has recently emerged [66,69,70,104,183,185,186,228]. Likewise, most of the works have been dedicated to study the effect of the rheological properties of the photocurable composite suspensions with different ratios of alumina/zirconia [104,185,186], printing strategies [228], proper de-binding processes, sintering temperatures and holding time [69], as well as the effect of particle size distribution [66] on printable conditions and final performance of the ceramic parts. Wu et al. 2017 [183] fabricated ZTA ceramics (alumina/zirconia 4:1) by SLA using raw materials with nanometre size. After sintering at 1600 °C during 4 h, the samples presented RD values of 99.5 %, H of 17.76 GPa, FS of 530 MPa, and KIc of 5.72 MPa.m1/2, which are values comparable to those for ceramics obtained through conventional ceramic processing (see Table 3). More recently, the same authors [70] proposed an integrated approach combining SLA/DLP and a liquid precursor infiltration to prepare alumina toughened zirconia composites. The ATZ samples produced with infiltration and post-CIP sintered at 1550 °C during 2 h hold RD around 98 %, H of 12.65 ± 0.24 GPa and KIc of 6.42 ± 0.33 MPa m1/2. Wu et al. 2018 [186] fabricated defect-free alumina-zirconia composites using SLA technique, followed by the application of a liquid drying and a two-step de-binding process. Full dense materials were attained when sintered at 1600 °C during 1 h. In resume, the main current drawbacks in the fabrication of dense alumina, zirconia ceramics or their composites by VP technologies are mainly related to the cure efficiency of the suspensions and the de-binding conditions. As a consequence, current research is mainly focused on developing photosensitive alumina and zirconia suspensions by fine-tuning their cure behaviour [405–407]. 4.2.2.6 Material Extrusion The ME category presents a total of 72 entries distributed by Robocasting (41 entries), CODE (17 entries), FFF (9 entries) and RC associated with FFF technology (RC + FFF, 5 entries). Concerning Robocasting (RC), the most studied materials have been alumina (21 entries) and zirconia (19 entries) with only 1 entry for composites (]20,80[ ZrO2 vol%). From Table 7, average RD values in RC are all between 95-99 % for alumina and zirconia materials, although the mechanical properties, particularly FS, are less reported and exhibit high variability between different studies when compared to CPP and CCT (Table 3). Several issues related to surface finishing, printing resolution and porosity inter-filaments are still to be solved. Feilden et al. 2016 [408] used hydrogel-based alumina inks with 36 vol% of solids to print simple 3D parts by RC, reaching 97 % of RD and 230 MPa of FS. The authors concluded that the defects resulting from the printing process limit the mechanical strength in many cases, and it depends on the orientation of the part with respect to the printing direction [408]. The properties of the final parts are also highly dependent on the ink’s behaviour, explaining the existence of several papers aimed to develop and optimize appropriate inks for RC [347,409–412]. The most common studied additives (thickening agents) for inks preparation in ceramics include polyethyleneimine (PEI), hydrogel of pluronic F-127, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and natural-based polymers such as carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). Besides the nature and amounts of thickening agents used in inks, solids loading and particle size of raw powders are also important parameters in RC. As it can be seen in Table 7, PS for alumina powders used in RC is 0.53 ± 0.22 μm (n=19), in good agreement with the reported RD values. Regarding solids loading in suspensions, Rueschhoff et al. 2016 [351] optimized it to obtain near-net-shaped dense alumina ceramic components by RC. Alumina suspensions containing 53–56 vol% were found to produce the best printing performance and sintered parts (1600 °C for 1 h) with RD exceeding 98 %. The authors report FS values after sintering around 134 MPa and 157 MPa for suspensions with 53 and 55 vol%, respectively, being lower than expected and largely affected by the porosity introduced during the preparation of suspensions and not by the solids loading in suspensions. Jones et al. 2019 [302] showed the possibility to produce alumina armour targets via RC and compared them against a commercially available isostatically pressed (IP) armour formulation. The RC plates exhibited similar RD as the samples obtained by the traditional method (around 97 %) and exhibited increased H but lower FS when compared to the commercial IP material. High variability in FS results for RC samples was observed in this study, being reported an average 4pt bending strength around 234 MPa for RC samples against 267 MPa for IP [302]. Recently, Elizarova et al. 2020 [413] presented a novel paste composition (consisting in a solution of phenolic resin in methyl ethyl ketone and ceramic powders) that allows the shaping of the green bodies after printing. Robocasted alumina parts using this ink presented RD after sintering up to 95 %, likely due to binder burnout defects, and an FS value of 356 MPa (3-point bending strength) which is comparable with those of other techniques. Regarding zirconia fabrication by RC, Table 7 presents a quite high mean value for the raw-particle size, derived from one study (1 entry) where authors referred to 44 μm as the PS value of zirconia [379]. Removing this value, the average PS for zirconia raw powders was similar to that for alumina. As in alumina ceramics, the same constraints have been experienced in the ME processing of zirconia. Peng et al. 2018 [110] fabricated yttria-stabilized zirconia structures by RC using suspensions with 38 vol% as solids loading. Printed samples exhibited RD values higher than 94 %, hardness up to 13.29 GPa and flexural strengths up to 242.8 ± 11.4 MPa. High linear shrinkage values (33 %) were also reported, perhaps associated with the quite low solids concentration used in the pastes. Branco et al. 2020 [144] explored RC for the fabrication of zirconia-based pieces for dental applications and compared their performance with commercial zirconia samples processed by a traditional subtractive manufacturing method (as CPP, sintering and machining). AM zirconia samples obtained from an ink with 40 vol% of solids revealed to be less dense (around 98 % RD) than commercial samples, also showing lower hardness, toughness and wettability. While structural properties were still inferior to those of traditionally manufactured zirconia dental components, important advantages of RC have been highlighted, namely the processing easiness and the tribological performance. Yu et al. 2020 [101] used RC to print yttria-partially-stabilized zirconia with 60 vol% solids loading. After sintering at 1550 °C for 5 h, following a period at 1700 °C for 6 minutes, the FS, KIc and H of the parts produced were 488.96 ± 79.84 MPa (16 repetitions of the same experiment), 2.63 ± 0.2 MPa.m1/2 (n=16), and 11.52 ± 0.57 GPa (n=5), respectively. Shao et al. 2017 [119] proposed the production of zirconia parts by a new variant of the RC process, named 3D gel printing (included in RC, Table 7), by using 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as the gelation system. The catalyst and initiator were fed into the screw extruder along with the slurry containing the ceramic particles to adjust the gelation time. After sintering at 1520 °C for 2 h, the RD, hardness and transverse rupture strength of the sintered zirconia parts were 97.6 %, 14.4 GPa and 450 MPa, respectively. Similarly, using a gelling suspension, Shi et al. 2020 [96] fabricated zirconia implanted teeth by extrusion-based printing and attained 98.5 %, 14.4 ± 0.1 GPa and 520 ± 20 MPa for RD, H and FS, respectively, after sintering at 1500 °C for 4 h. Alternatively to several gelling systems, binders and thickening agents, some authors tried to develop suitable inks for RC free of organic additives [124,355]. Hensen et al. 2018 [355] employed direct coagulation of alumina nanopowder slurries with the polyvalent salt tri-ammonium citrate to promote the solidification of the paste. Although RD higher than 97 % was reached after sintering at 1550 °C for up to 2 h, thin-walled parts have been printed which could explain the high variability of flexural modulus and less FS presented when compared to the commercial samples. Recently, Rodrigues et al. 2020 [124] reported the possibility to print zirconia-based dental pieces from pastes with high solids concentration in the 80-90 wt% range, just by using the optimal amount of dispersant. The optimal results were achieved for the paste with 88 wt%, resulting in sintered parts with 97.1 ± 0.8 % of RD, H of 14.46 GPa and KIc of 4.11 ± 0.09 MPa.m1/2 (n=5) [124]. Rather than inks optimization, post-processing methods, such as vacuum sintering and HIP, have been considered to reach very high densities (> 99 %) [380,414]. Carloni et al. 2020 [414] used vacuum sintering to obtain transparent alumina ceramics printed by RC. Mamatha et al. 2018 [380] increased RD of alumina samples printed by RC from 98 % (when pressureless sintered at 1650 °C for 1 h) to 99.7 % (when HIPed at 1350 °C using 165 MPa pressure). While promising mechanical properties have been attained for ceramics printed by RC, this technique still does not provide complete freedom of achievable printing shapes. To overcome this limitation, RC has been associated with other operating principles used in other techniques where shape complexity is easier to accomplish, such as SLA/DLP and FFF. Faes et al. 2016 [142] extruded zirconia suspensions in thermoplastic carriers containing a binder and further cured the deposited paste by continuous UV-light polymerization. Scheithauer et al. 2015 [134] developed an AM process that combines RC and thermoplastic 3D Printing (FFF/FDM). They used a thermoplastic binder system (a mixture of paraffin and beeswax) at 100 °C to prepare alumina (67 vol% solids) and zirconia (45 vol% solids). Sintered samples (alumina at 1600 °C, zirconia at 1500 °C) with a density of about 99 % were obtained, although only single-wall pieces were produced. A similar procedure (a combination of RC and thermoplastic printing) has been used by Promakhov et al. 2018 [217] to fabricate 80 % zirconia and 20 % alumina composites (not specified if in vol% or wt%). This was the single report of the systematic review concerning the fabrication of alumina/zirconia composites by RC (see Table 7). The authors verified that the temperature of the hot zone in the printing process critically affects the wall thickness and the quality of the printed samples. After sintering at 1500 °C for 1 h, samples presented around 15 % porosity, a quite high value that markedly affects the mechanical performance of the samples (450 ± 70 MPa as 3pt bending strength and 14 GPa as microhardness, see Table 7). Some limitations in RC could be overcome, or at least weakened, by using finer extrusion nozzles, however at the expense of increasing the overall fabrication time. Concerning CODE technology, more entries are presented for zirconia than for alumina (Table 7). In comparison with RC, RD values for zirconia ceramics produced by CODE exhibit higher average and lower variability (Table 7). Mean FS values for zirconia produced by CODE are still far from those attained in CCT and CPP techniques (Table 3). Oppositely, FS, H, E and KIc for alumina (Table 7) present average values highly comparable with those of the conventional processing (Table 3). Ghazanfari et al. 2017 [352] used the CODE technique to obtain alumina specimens from suspensions containing 60 vol% of solids. In that paper, the samples were reported to exhibit an RD value of 98 %, E of 371 ± 14 GPa (n=20), 364 ± 50 MPa (n=24) of FS, KIc of 4.5 ± 0.1 MPa.m1/2 (n=6) and a H value of 19.8 ± 0.6 GPa (n=20), after sintering at 1550 °C during 1.5 h. A total volume shrinkage of around 42 % was also stated [352]. In another paper [132], the same authors also considered CODE technology to produce yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) from pastes with 50 vol% of solids. Sintering parts at 1550 °C for 0.5 h and 2.5 h presented similar RD values (around 98 %). H and FS were respectively 15.3 ± 0.4 GPa (n=5) and 232 ± 55 MPa when sintered at 1550 °C for 0.5 h, and 14.5 ± 0.4 GPa (n=5) and 278 ± 59 MPa when the holding time increased to 2.5 h [132]. Li et al. 2018 [143] also used CODE to developed 3Y-TZP test specimens using pastes with solids loading > 50 vol% and evaluated the effect of the sintering conditions in the printed parts. When sintered at 1550 °C for 1 h holding time, final components presented RD higher than 99 %, H of 13.1 GPa and 3pt FS of 715 MPa. To achieve highly complex parts, Li et al. 2020 [65] reported the possibility to print 3Y-TZP samples by CODE using support structures of sacrificial materials, namely polycaprolactone, silicone and petrolatum. Petrolatum was identified as the most feasible support material. The shrinkages of sintered zirconia pieces after sintering at 1550 °C for 1 h ranged between 21.9 % and 22.8 %, with no significant anisotropic behaviour [65]. As in other AM technologies, new modifications to CODE are also appearing to improve the printing process, including new inks’ composition with high solids loading to subsequently reduce high shrinkages and enhance mechanical properties. As an example, Yang et al. 2019 [415] used carrageenan polymer (0.4 wt%) that absorbs water under heat-inducing, promoting rapid curing of alumina suspensions. During the 3D printing process, a hot silicone oil bath (65 °C) heats the extruded paste uniformly to promote fast solidification avoiding the collapse of the printed part, resulting in a component free of defects or deformations. Thin-wall alumina ceramics have been printed by this process, however, there was no report on the mechanical properties of the sintered pieces. Finally, the FFF technology was represented in the database with much fewer entries (9 entries) and, although not shown in Table 7 as a single category, the literature results deserve a comment. The FFF entries come from 3 papers published in 2020 [138,416,417] dedicated to the fabrication of alumina or zirconia parts, and reporting the mechanical properties of the sintered parts or, at least, relative density. Orlovská et al. 2020 [416] studied the influence of the layer thickness on the final properties of alumina ceramics obtained by FFF from a composite filament containing 50 vol% of ceramic powder. Depending on the layer thickness, RD ranged between 80-89 % and FS between 200-300 MPa after sintering at 1600 °C during 1 h holding time. Gorjan et al. [417] considered the rheological properties and printability of thermoplastic Al2O3 filaments and evaluated the flow behaviour of this feedstock by printing a model piece with thin walls. Although the printed sample presented a quite high RD value (around 99 %), low mechanical strength (around 150 MPa) was reported, emphasizing that the high density attained derives from the easiness to remove binders in thin-walled parts. The printing defects were however referred to as the primary cause that determined the low strength of the sintered samples. Cano et al. [138] studied the influence of infill orientation on the properties of zirconia parts fabricated by FFF. Three common defects in FFF shaping have been acknowledged as the main determinant for different densities (95-98 %) and bending strengths (366-512 MPa) values, namely inter-filament holes, defects created by the material over extrusion and nozzle shearing in the deposited material. As future research aiming the minimization of printing defects, the authors suggest the use of filaments with tight dimensional tolerances, control the over extrusion and evaluate the influence of the ceramic powder content and the moisture on the degradation of the organic components. The high amounts of organics (used as the base matrix in the production of filaments) require long thermal cycles for de-binding processes in parts produced by FFF, leading to high shrinkages in sintered parts, which is also appointed as a limitation for ceramics fabrication by this technology [418]. This table is organized by category and its technologies, following the same colour scheme as in Fig. 7. The results for each category/technology include all database entries referring to it. Some technologies are not in this representation (BJP, LSD, S-SLS, IJP, PSD, LCM and RC + FFF). 5 Challenges and future perspectives in the fabrication of dense ceramics This section focuses on four main topics. The first topic includes a historical evolution of the production processes aiming at alumina/zirconia technical ceramics (CPP, CCT and AM), while the second topic details and discusses the results obtained for the several AM categories and technologies. The discussion is supported by the dataset information and intends to provide an overall picture of the research over the last two decades. The third topic presents and discusses AM market trends, based on the quantitative information available on AM of functional ceramics. The previous discussions culminate in the fourth topic, which presents future trends and needs in the development of AM as well as in its implementation as a consolidated industrial process. 5.1 Historical evolution of the research in alumina/zirconia ceramics The recent interest in AM of functional ceramics has driven the development of numerous feedstocks and procedures predominantly still in R&D phases. The historical research panorama throughout the last 20 years in the fabrication of alumina, zirconia, ATZ and ZTA composites by traditional production processes (CPP and CCT) and AM is presented in Fig. 9 . As expected, AM exploitation in these ceramics increased significantly in the last 5 years, with a remarkable higher number of published papers in 2015-2020 for AM when compared to CPP and CCT. Both conventional processes have been losing some attention in the research field, clearly due to their maturity in the production of functional ceramics. A similar trend is observed for the number of database entries collected for AM entries, although the relative difference between AM and CPP/CCT entries is not so accentuated. This lower relative difference (within entries) can be explained by the fact that papers reporting AM results (powder- or suspension-based) also include the comparison to the structural and mechanical results attained by the closest-fitting conventional technologies. This is a clear indication that conventional processes are being used as a reference (gold standard) for AM evolution. Furthermore, the data are in good agreement with the conclusions and perspectives outlined by Franks et al. 2017 [8], forecasting research at multiple fronts related to colloidal-based science to further advance the AM research field, namely suspension-based AM categories. Solely in 2020, more than 40 research papers were dedicated to AM of dense alumina, zirconia and respective composites including their structural and mechanical characterization. Following this trend, an exponential growth in R&D of dense functional ceramics by AM is expected in the next 5 years. Since alumina or zirconia ceramics are now highly explored in AM research field, further market exploitation will certainly occur for several applications, including biomedical ones. On the other hand, considering the few manuscripts devoted to AM of ZTA or ATZ ceramics published until now (see Table 6), a clear opportunity for R&D in these materials is identified. The AM scientific evolution throughout time illustrated in Fig. 9 agrees with the patenting scenario of ceramics AM recently reported by Mathews et al. 2020 [419]. The number of patent registrations from 2008 to 2014 has been slower and gradually increasing, with a sudden growth from 2015-2018 and the highest number of registrations being reached in 2017. According to the authors, the number of patents reported in 2018 underestimates its real number (as patents are only available in the public domain after their publication, on average, 18 months from the filing date) and continuous exponential growth is foreseen in the incoming years (data source PatSeer Pro™). The abrupt increasing trend of patent applications in the short-term is also supported by the data reported by the European Patent Office [420]. The patents on ceramics published between 2008 and 2018 reached the total number of 1110 [419,420], distributed among those aiming the development of material formulations for AM technologies (421 patents), focusing the novelties in processes (345), dedicated to the new applications for ceramic parts produced by AM (189) and dealing with equipment advances (155). Concerning applications, the healthcare sector was the largest one from a patent viewpoint, with other industries gaining some space, such as aerospace and automobiles, mechanical and metallurgical and electronics and electrical, from which zirconia, alumina and their composites will be strongly contributing [419,420]. Finally, in terms of geographic distribution, the Asian continent was identified as the leader in registering novelties in AM of ceramics, with China being the key player. This agrees with the distribution of the AM database entries by country displayed in Fig. 10 , showing that more than 50 % of the AM database entries (out of 359, Table 2) have the participation of, at least, one R&D institution from China. This number goes to 17 % (out of 954 entries, Table 2) for the database entries related to conventional technologies. 5.2 Selection criteria for AM technologies in their production Fig. 11 presents the distribution of AM database entries per category and technology distinguishing alumina, zirconia and their composites. As expected, VP is the AM category most explored for all materials, given the advantages outlined in Table 5 and market ranking for SLA/DLP and LCM technologies. Even if the higher amounts of resins could lead to cracks and deformations on the produced materials, the drawbacks of VP are overcome using slow rates and longer holding stages in the binder burnout step. Additionally, photopolymerizable resin-based alumina and zirconia suspensions are already available in the market (e.g. from Lithoz [345]) opening the possibility for the research community to be highly focused on the fine-tuning of the printing process and sintering conditions of the green ceramic parts to achieve optimal final properties. For alumina and zirconia dense ceramics, ME and PBF have been the second most explored categories (Fig. 11). The increased number of ME experiments (namely for RC and CODE) is explained by the fact that these suspension-based technologies make use of small amounts of organics when compared with VP, for example. Furthermore, since both alumina and zirconia ceramics were deeply studied in CCT, it is expected that, at least, part of the knowledge acquired in CCT could be directly applied to AM. As a matter of fact, RC is well-established in the literature to produce porous components and current R&D points out that RC is also well-suited to print dense bodies. The preference for the PBF category could be related to the easiness of use and process rate (powder-based SLS) and the possibility to print the final ceramic part in a single-step (SLM). Following the same principle (ease and speed of printing), BJ has also been applied to high-quality technical ceramics, even if showing a small number of database entries (around 10 % for alumina or zirconia and no entries for mixtures) perhaps related to the low density of the green parts produced by BJ technologies. Although much less explored than alumina or zirconia ceramics, the alumina-zirconia composites produced by AM technologies are becoming a vivid topic of research, based on the growing interest of these ceramics in the healthcare sector (dentistry and orthopaedics). The high applicability and acceptance of AM of zirconia in this sector also explain its higher maturity R&D level when compared to alumina, concerning final density and mechanical performance (see Fig. 8). Surprisingly, LENS from the DED category is the second most explored technology in the fabrication of composites, oppositely to alumina or zirconia (see Fig. 11). This could be explained by the existence of a eutectic mixture in the system alumina/zirconia arising the interest of the scientific community to explore these composite materials using direct technologies (single-step) such as LENS and SLM. 5.3 Market trends in AM of ceramics According to the Additive Manufacturing Landscape from the 2020 report published by AMFG/Autonomous manufacturing (www.amfg.ai), the most pronounced market categories are hardware, materials and services [421]. As illustrated in Fig. 12 , hardware represents 56 % of the total AM market and includes 3D printing machines (metal, polymer, ceramic, composite) as main segments, as well as desktop and electronic machines. Materials hold 20 % of the market share, divided between metals and polymers with no reference to ceramic materials (residual market share). The remaining 23 % of the market share includes AM services comprising software, research institutions and post-processing. Currently, metal and polymer 3D printing machines and corresponding materials are the largest market segments. Nevertheless, just a few practical full-scale applications for 3D-printed ceramics are available on the market, especially for structural applications. As an example, Tofail et al. 2028 [9] refer to key AM applications in several industries e.g. automobile, aerospace/aeronautics, medicine/pharmaceutical, sports and construction. The numbers presented in Fig. 12 give clear evidence that AM is not yet fully established in the production of ceramics at the industrial level which in turn could be understood as a strong opportunity for research, innovation and new business niche [9]. This market landscape is in agreement with the trend of patents for AM of ceramics [419,421]. As most of the patents in materials (2015-2017) are registered by R&D Institutions, the knowledge is currently protected and available to be either acquired by the AM industry or on the public domain, in the next few years [419]. The research to market time increases by the protection of the intellectual property and delays the market growth for the given period of the protection. Concordantly, the number of patent registrations on hardware (equipment and machinery) is lower than that on materials [421], which can explain why ceramic hardware currently holds a market share of 7 % against no market share reported for ceramic materials (Fig. 12). Certainly, the evolution of ceramic AM hardware and their fast introduction in the market roadmap leveraged from the previous (and already consolidated) knowledge acquired in the development of hardware for metals and polymers. Currently, the best-known companies that develop 3D printers to process ceramic materials include WASP (Italy), AIM3D (Germany) and Nanoe (France) for material extrusion, ADMATEC (Netherlands), Prodways (France), Steinbach AG (Germany), 3DCeram (France), Lithoz (Austria) for vat photopolymerization, ExOne (USA), XJet (Israel) and Voxeljet (Germany) for binder jetting and material jetting. However, as the demand for AM of ceramic components is growing, the development of new and/or updated hardware as well as adequate materials will inevitably become the future key segments in this area. The AM technology applied to ceramics is foreseen to reach maturity within the next five/six years when AM of advanced ceramics (like alumina, zirconia and their composites) are expected to drive the growth of the ceramic 3D printing market in the medium to long term [421]. In this market report, ME is established as a typical technology for clay-like materials, while VP, BJ and MJ are presented as more suitable for high-performance ceramic materials. However, the large number of published research papers/experiments in ME technologies in recent years (Fig. 9) supports a paradigm change in the near future, in which ME technologies could be industrialized for technical ceramics. Several economic reports on ceramics AM include projections of revenues for the AM technologies implemented in ceramics processing. As an example, recent SmarTech reports revealed that the revenues in AM of ceramics are in a fast-upward trend and are expected to generate a global market segment of approximately $3.8 billion in 2029 [422]. As illustrated in Fig. 13a, the market in 2020 totalizes $268 million and has its highest revenue on services and hardware (totalizing 2/3 of the total market, around 1/3 for each segment) followed by materials and parts segments (totalizing 1/3 of the total market, around 13 % and 20 % respectively for each segment). Until 2028, these market segments will grow consistently, although at different rhythms: i) the segment addressing the production of parts is expected to hold the largest development (around 34 times the 2020 market value), leveraged from the acquired experience of those working with AM techniques for metal and polymer materials; ii) materials and hardware segments are expected to uprise similarly and more moderately until 2028 (~10 times the 2020 market value); iii) services segment is foreseen in 2028 to hold the lowest market increase with respect to 2020 (~5 times the 2020 market value). Therefore, a clear market shift is foreseen for 2028, where the development of materials and parts will be the highest revenue segments (totalizing 60 % of the total market) against services and hardware (40 %). As a general overview over the incoming years, the logistic processes in the AM sector are expected to be converted in commercial manufacturing, in which both processes and materials will be more intensively and continuously explored, validated and implemented to accomplish the necessary improvements in the ceramic materials and parts produced by AM. That effect will be particularly visible after 2025, the changing point in the increasing trend of the forecasts when the major ceramics AM technologies are expected to be ready to support actual serial production [422]. Another report presents the revenue projections for the ceramic AM market (2019-2029), distinguishing different ceramic materials [423]. Fig. 13b shows an exponential increase in ceramic AM materials revenues predicted for the next decade. Furthermore, technical ceramics currently hold and will continue to hold, larger revenues in comparison with traditional ceramics (around 84 % of total revenues in 2020 and ~70 % of total revenues in 2029). Although exhibiting lower revenues, traditional materials (including sand, cement and glass) increase their revenue share in 2029 (16 % in 2020 against 30 % in 2029). These materials are known to be extremely versatile and affordable end-use materials, ideal for a wide range of utilitarian products as well as industrial moulds [423]. Among the technical ceramics, zirconia stands out as the leading in revenues, in 2020 and 2029, maintaining a 38 % share of the total revenues. Together, alumina- and zirconia-based materials will hold, in 2029, around 52 % of the revenues against other technical and traditional materials. These market perspectives are clearly supported by the current research activity and emphasis regarding alumina and zirconia ceramics (see Fig. 11). The current research efforts in AM of these materials will sustain the implementation of reliable technologies for dense functional ceramics that are expected, in a near future, to be translated to the market. Since the above-mentioned market reports have been released before the COVID-19 pandemic situation, significant changes are expected in the increasing trend of the market forecasts. For 2020, the global smart manufacturing market size (which may include AM of functional ceramics) is already estimated to decrease around 16 % when compared to the pre-COVID-19 evaluation [424]. Also, during several months in 2020 and 2021, manufacturing units were forced to close without the possibility to continue their production, which created a ripple effect throughout the world’s manufacturing facilities and, inclusive, ruptured the entire supply chain [424]. However, it should be highlighted that additive manufacturing also emerged in this pandemic period as a strong solution to fight the lack of several devices and support the shortage in personal protective equipment for the medical staff and general community [425,426]. Therefore, feed by the urgent need of the situation, a larger investment in production processes may take place with the aim to reduce the time-to-market of the critical devices and equipment to cope with COVID-19 impacts. The unexpected extra-investment may leverage further AM developments and will allow its materials and processes currently under R&D to escalate more rapidly to the industry. 5.4 Future research trends, industrialization and needs Additive manufacturing of functional ceramics still needs to overcome the limited performances of the printed parts, including density, mechanical properties, surface finish, geometrical complexity and scalability. Although significant research efforts have been made to attain dense alumina, zirconia and their composites, the widespread of this knowledge at the industrial level still demands additional experimental work and strong investments. Even if AM technologies are currently able to produce small alumina/zirconia components with acceptable properties, at a lab scale and even some at the industrial level, there is still no demonstration concerning the successful AM production of large bulk 3D-printed parts with high density and smooth surface. Therefore, the AM establishment in the industrial production of large bulk parts depends mostly on the development and the maturation of the AM processes to allow the production of AM parts and components with performance, at least, comparable to that of parts and components fabricated by conventional manufacturing (CPP and CCT). Based on the extensive knowledge already gathered with conventional processing of alumina or zirconia ceramics and, given the large impact of particle size distribution and particle packing in the final densities and structural performances of the ceramics, colloidal-based AM technologies stand out as the most promising for the production of these ceramics. The use of a liquid medium in colloidal processing allows a better dispersion and high homogeneity of submicron/nanopowders, resulting in a more effective packing density and higher sintering activity than coarser ceramic particles. The chance to use small-sized particles opens up the possibility of using lower tip sizes, e.g. in ME technologies, which enables the formation of thinner layers and improvements in surface roughness. The knowledge of colloidal processing will also help in the preparation of long-term stable inks/pastes to be stored, which will allow expanding the market of slurry-based technologies, especially those from the ME category. Regarding the materials and considering the current research and industrial status on VP, DED and PBF technologies for alumina or zirconia ceramics, it is foreseen that both ATZ and ZTA ceramic composites will be vastly explored in a near future and will soon appear in the market. This is in good agreement with Mathews et al. 2020 [419] when pointing out that innovations in ceramic-based composite materials suitable for AM are on the rise owing to their adaptability, suitability and mechanical properties. Therefore, a significant development in the AM ceramics sector is expected in the next few years, namely in processes, materials, and applications. The sintering process is identified as the largest obstacle in ceramic AM processing, stated in high thermal stresses generated (e.g. in direct technologies as LENS and SLM), high energy consumption, long heating cycles (de-binding and sintering) and environmental contaminations (high carbon footprint). The cold sintering process (CSP) has been suggested as an alternative solution that could reinvent the concept of sintering and, thus, shift the processing paradigm in ceramics [427,428]. Although highly explored in other technical ceramics, CSP has also been reported in the fabrication of zirconia stabilized with 8 mol% yttria [429] as a good mark for future progress. Therefore, it is expected that CSP could be integrated within existing AM technologies [430], including printing processes, providing a significant breakthrough in establishing greener manufacturing routes, and concomitantly opening the door for new materials and applications. Multi-material AM in the same piece could be a reality if the sintering process is simplified. Also, the consequences and impacts of adopting AM production on ceramics industrial sustainability (i.e. circular economy, recycling and life cycle assessment) are current concerns [431,432]. For some organizations, AM will be a direct replacement in the production chain while, for others, AM will be complementary to the existing conventional production. Other organizations will try to enter the market with small-scale customized products, produced and sold at a more competitive price since AM can decrease production costs. Concerning the type of materials and sustainability of the AM processes, ceramics are pointed out as the class of materials in need of more research (namely in energy and costs optimization, use of environmentally friendly materials and processes), as well as in need of increasing the potential for recycling. R&D priorities in line with sustainability requirements include automating and minimizing post-processing of ceramics after production, continuing to lower-cost equipment and materials, and increasing diversification of machine sizes, speeds and accuracies and reduce toxic additives in the feedstock. Five insights on the future of technical ceramics have also been captured at Ceramics Expo 2019 (a leading annual conference and forum for the advanced ceramics and glass industries held in Cleveland, Ohio, US), specifically: (1) the need for ceramics in 5G, (2) growing industry partnerships, (3) improving knowledge in AM, (4) need for speed in R&D and (5) ceramics customization allowable by AM. 5G antenna performance will require materials to handle thermal management of the complex operating environments associated with 5G infrastructure; in this context, technical ceramic materials have unparalleled properties. The demand for small ceramic parts with tight tolerances will drive the AM industry to fill this gap. The market trends will subsequently generate partnerships between industry and research institutions that, in turn, will speed up the R&D in this area. This trend is somewhat highly perceptible nowadays and is supported by the data collected in this paper (Fig. 9). Furthermore, it is worthwhile to refer that the ceramics AM industry faces hiring challenges, concerning AM specialized individuals that could help to drive the industry forward. Therefore, raising a talent pipeline of leaders, engineers and machine workers in AM of ceramics is a future need, in which educational institutions, and namely the universities, will contribute by offering specialized AM courses. When all these conditions are met, AM of ceramics will move from a research and prototyping attempt into full-scale design and manufacturing of customized components and composites. AM of alumina- and zirconia-based functional ceramics have the potential to revolutionize the industry with the possibility to decline traditional manufacturing for certain applications, even though the knowledge acquired in CPP and CCT technologies are still playing an important role during this changing stage. 6 Conclusions In the last 20 years of research, conventional powder pressing and colloidal-based technologies achieved a high degree of maturity in the knowhow of the interdependences between processing variables and final performance of functional ceramics, as those based on alumina, zirconia and their composites. Particles packing, particle size and size distribution, particles’ homogeneity, solids loading, suspensions stability, sintering temperature and time are examples of important factors that determine the final properties of the ceramics. Densification associated with geometric complexity fabrication is easier to accomplish in traditional colloidal-based than in powder-based technologies. The reasons for that are also feeding the suspension-based AM technologies (such as SLA/DLP/LCM, Robocasting, CODE, MJ) and driven the conception of new technologies (LSD as suspension-based BJ and S-iLS as suspension-based indirect laser sintering) from categories where the feedstock has been typically a powder. Also, the fabrication of high-density (pore-free) and cracks-free technical ceramic parts with high surface finishing by colloidal-based processes explains the research emphasis on research towards suspension-based AM technologies. Furthermore, the continuous proposal of new AM technologies for ceramic materials in recent years, or even variants of existing technologies well established for other materials (e.g. polymers or metals) has led to novel and diverse terminologies in the literature reports. Therefore, the standardization of the names (and definitions) in ceramic technologies with similar processing principles is identified as a need. Being AM well-suited to low-volume production and complex-shaped ceramic components, research in AM of technical ceramics has begun to replace traditional processing. Nevertheless, conventional processing will always prevail for mass production at lower manufacturing costs, regardless of the attained final properties. AM is showing a rapid increase in research literature reports in the last 3 years, being zirconia more studied than alumina (or the ZTA and ATZ composites). In fact, the strength and toughness improvements in zirconia-based ceramics are still current challenges in conventional processing and subsequently in additive manufacturing, since this property promotes significantly its industrial application. Zirconia phases composition and phase stabilizers, grain size and sintering methods are still current research topics in the search for the best performance of zirconia. The widespread use of zirconia AM parts in the healthcare market well justifies the higher maturity level found for this material. Nevertheless, mechanical properties comparable to those obtained by conventional processes have been reported in several AM studies, for all materials. The VP and ME technologies are those leading to better densification and consequently smaller standard deviations on the resulting structural performances among different reports. The results achieved by BJ, MJ and PBF are still far from the required for certain applications. The use of single-step technologies to produce defect-free and fully dense alumina or zirconia ceramic parts is not yet a reality and seems to be far from being achievable shortly, as just a few research studies have been reported on this topic. When compared to pure alumina or stabilized zirconia ceramics, Al2O3-ZrO2 composites are less studied in conventional processing as well as in AM. The eutectic composition in this Al2O3-ZrO2 system started to motivate the fabrication of these materials by direct consolidation techniques as LENS (DED) and SLM (PBF), oppositely to alumina or zirconia. So, the R&D in AM of these composite materials is still in its infancy which turns to be an opportunity to create business and expand the market in materials/processes in AM ceramics. The interest in AM of functional ceramics is growing rapidly while industrial adoption is not keeping this pace, but slowly increasing, being still required strong efforts to place new materials, processes and new machines in the market, that goes through more R&D, new applications for ceramics produced by AM, creation of industrial partnerships and improving knowledge in the employers of AM industries.

        "doc_abstract": "© 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.In 2021 the media reported multiple scenarios of devastation due to wildfires throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Wildfires have short- and long-term impacts on air quality due to the substantial release of air pollutants that can spread over large distances and may constitute a threat to human health. In this context, it is widely beneficial to develop suitable methods for continuous monitoring of air pollutants, able to produce quantitative time-variant snapshots of air quality. This work borrows some ideas of Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) based on Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (DPCA). Shortly, the multivariate collected data are condensed into time-variant evaluations of the Hotelling’s T2 and Q statistics, which allow the quantification of the deviance of the process with respect to a reference behavior. The aim of this method is the identification of temporal episodes of large deviations from typical (generally safe) levels of concentrations. The analysis focuses on hourly time series of CO and PM concentrations, collected during 2021 at a monitoring station located in the populated area of Athens (Greece). Despite some methodological limitations and the reduced sample size, DPCA based SPM provides a promising framework to identify temporal episodes of large deviations from typical levels of air pollutants.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2021 The Society of Manufacturing EngineersRobocasting is an extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) technique, highly explored in the fabrication of porous structures or thin-walled ceramics. Comparing to other slurry-based AM technologies, robocasting presents a high potential to produce dense bulk ceramics, thanks to the low organic binder contents and high solids loading used in the feedstock. Despite these benefits, the robocasting fabrication of ceramics with similar mechanical performance as those produced by traditional methods remains a challenge. The goal of this work is to fine-tune the robocasting printing process of dense alumina ceramics by evaluating the influence of in-fill filaments orientation and the medium where the deposition process occurs (air or paraffin bath), on defects and mechanical performance of the sintered parts. Relative density, shrinkage, three-point flexural strength, Young's modulus and hardness were analysed. The specimens with the highest performance were sintered at 1550 °C or 1600 °C temperatures for 2 h holding time and the results were compared with slip casting (SC) samples sintered in the same conditions. Alumina robocasting samples, printed longitudinally in air with controlled humidity and sintered at 1600 °C, exhibited relative density ≈99% with flexural strength (≈350 MPa), Young's modulus (≈366 GPa) and hardness (≈17 GPa) values comparable to those obtained for SC samples. Numerical modelling and simulation were used to analyse the experimental values and the anisotropic behaviour of the printed specimens. Experimental Young's modulus results were compared with the Voigt-Reuss bound and the Hashin-Shtrikman upper-bound, as well as the analytical predictions of a Mooney-type exponential relation.",

Robocasting is an extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) technique, highly explored in the fabrication of porous structures or thin-walled ceramics. Comparing to other slurry-based AM technologies, robocasting presents a high potential to produce dense bulk ceramics, thanks to the low organic binder contents and high solids loading used in the feedstock. Despite these benefits, the robocasting fabrication of ceramics with similar mechanical performance as those produced by traditional methods remains a challenge. The goal of this work is to fine-tune the robocasting printing process of dense alumina ceramics by evaluating the influence of in-fill filaments orientation and the medium where the deposition process occurs (air or paraffin bath), on defects and mechanical performance of the sintered parts. Relative density, shrinkage, three-point flexural strength, Young's modulus and hardness were analysed. The specimens with the highest performance were sintered at 1550 °C or 1600 °C temperatures for 2 h holding time and the results were compared with slip casting (SC) samples sintered in the same conditions. Alumina robocasting samples, printed longitudinally in air with controlled humidity and sintered at 1600 °C, exhibited relative density ≈99% with flexural strength (≈350 MPa), Young's modulus (≈366 GPa) and hardness (≈17 GPa) values comparable to those obtained for SC samples. Numerical modelling and simulation were used to analyse the experimental values and the anisotropic behaviour of the printed specimens. Experimental Young's modulus results were compared with the Voigt-Reuss bound and the Hashin-Shtrikman upper-bound, as well as the analytical predictions of a Mooney-type exponential relation. Keywords Robocasting Alumina Dense ceramics Mechanical properties Filaments patterning Finite element analysis Representative Unit-Cell Micromechanical models 1 Introduction The manufacturing industry has been moving towards customization instead of mass production of single-use products for several reasons: (i) the increase in economic competitiveness, (ii) the possibility to better meet individual customer needs and (iii) to reduce wastes and costs towards a more sustainable economy [1]. Additive Manufacturing (AM) plays an important role in this path, providing flexibility to produce complex designs, usually at a reduced cost (time and material) [2,3]. Although AM is well-established for polymers and metals, at scientific and industrial levels, AM of ceramics has been recently growing [4,5]. The inherent properties of ceramic materials and their processing conditions (high melting point and the need for thermal treatment for consolidation after shaping) might be some of the difficulties in the development of efficient AM processes for these materials. Therefore, the production of defect-free AM ceramic parts with proper mechanical performance is a current research challenge in the ceramics' field [5,6]. Alumina is a ceramic material widely used in the production of technical ceramics for high-performance applications (a.k.a. high-performance ceramics, HPC [6]), including supports for catalysts, and thermal or electrical insulators. The manufacture of these HPC components requires strict quality control, including high density (>99% of relative density) and tight limits in dimensions, structural and mechanical properties after sintering, being up to now widely fabricated by conventional ceramic shaping techniques, namely, powder (pressing) or colloidal-based (slip casting, gel casting, injection moulding) [7–11]. Although final ceramic parts with high structural performance can be produced by conventional methods, it is unlikely that these methods will be suitable for the fabrication of certain geometries to answer the up-to-date technological evolutions. In particular, the powder-based techniques, typically involving uniaxial pressing followed by cold isostatic pressing and singular sintering conditions (e.g., hot isostatic pressing) to attain high dense ceramics, are limited to simple geometries. The production of complex shapes by powder-based techniques demands hard machining to achieve the final shape, which is a high-cost and time-consuming process that discards valuable material and wears cutting tools [12]. Colloidal-based techniques, such as near-net-shape slip casting and gel casting, overcome some of these disadvantages and thus are highly recommended for complex ceramic architectures, even if requiring a master and respective mould forming [7,9,11]. Particles' segregation, moulds complexity and difficulties to achieve dense massive pieces are disadvantages of slip casting, while toxicity associated with organic gel precursors and porosity after sintering derived to their burn-out are weaknesses of gel casting. Thus, AM appeared as a potential alternative for HPC [4,5,13]. The AM techniques vastly proposed for ceramics, particularly for the production of alumina parts, include selective laser melting/sintering (SLM/SLS) [14,15], binder jetting [16,17], robocasting [18–23], fused filament fabrication (FFF) [24], stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP) [25,26]. Due to the nature of the process (mainly powder as feedstock material), SLS/SLM and binder jetting usually result in highly porous ceramic parts while suspension-based AM technologies from material extrusion (robocasting/Ceramic On-Demand Extrusion (CODE)) and vat photopolymerization (SLA/DLP) categories are more suitable for the production of dense ceramics [13,23,27]. Therefore, most of these suspension-based AM processes demand the addition of organic additives (binder, resins) as a base matrix for the ceramic particles, being compulsory the use of a binder burnout process and a sintering step to densify the final structure after printing. The content of these additives is particularly high in FFF, SLA and DLP, requiring extended thermal debinding to avoid cracks and high porosity levels, resulting in high shrinkage. Robocasting is a viable alternative that requires low organic binder contents when compared to FFF, SLA and DLP, being considered an affordable and reliable technique for ceramics fabrication [18]. Being an extrusion-based technique, it relies on a viscous paste with suitable rheological properties to flow from a small orifice, keeping its shape afterwards. Although robocasting is well established in the fabrication of porous structures for several ceramic materials and applications [4,5,27–31], it has just started to be explored for dense ceramic structures [32,33], showing just a few publications for alumina [27,34]. Feilden et al. [20] developed hydrogel-based alumina inks with 36 vol% of solids to print simple dense 3D parts by robocasting. The authors concluded that the mechanical strength is directly related to the defects resulting from the printing process, as well as to the orientation of the part concerning the printing direction. Low amounts of ceramic solids, which could lead to high shrinkage and fast and non-uniform drying during the printing process, were also identified to reduce ceramics structural performance [4,5]. Rueschhoff et al. [23] maximized solids' amount of alumina inks to 53–56 vol% and, although relative densities above 98% were obtained, the authors concluded that the flexural strength (ranging from 134 to 157 MPa) was not influenced by the solid loading (in the range considered). To avoid defects arising from the drying process, a new variant of robocasting referred to as CODE, has been developed [35]. In this technique, the ceramic paste is extruded inside a paraffin bath container, one layer is printed and infrared radiation is applied to dry it uniformly. Although fast water evaporation is prevented in the ceramic part during printing, other complications are envisioned during the sintering step due to the presence of the organic components (paraffin/oil bath), which can be minimized with the use of pastes/suspensions with high solids loading. As an example, Ghazanfari et al. [36] used CODE to obtain alumina specimens from suspensions holding 60 vol% of solids. The samples presented a relative density of 98% and an average flexural strength of 364 ± 50 MPa. In summary, even though a few recent strategies have been reported to reach high dense ceramics, the ability to also reach proper mechanical properties from high reproducibility methods remains a challenge and demands further scientific efforts to fine-tune materials and processes in the fabrication of high-performance ceramics. Aiming the definition of the optimal conditions to produce advanced alumina ceramics by robocasting, the present work evaluates the effect of printing strategies, namely infill orientation of filaments (different patterns), printing environment (paraffin bath or in air with controlled humidity) and sintering temperature on the structural and mechanical properties of dense alumina parts. Shrinkage, density, flexural strength, hardness and Young's modulus of sintered alumina samples were quantified and compared to those obtained in alumina samples fabricated by slip casting, a colloidal-based manufacturing technique. The quantitative experimental values of all alumina samples were analysed together with microstructure and compared with the numerical values obtained by finite element analyses. Both experimental and numerical results for Young's modulus were compared with the bound of Voigt-Reuss and the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman, as well as with the analytical predictions of a Mooney-type exponential relation. 2 Materials and methods This section describes the experimental procedure, including the samples preparation and their characterisation, as well as the methods used in numerical modelling and simulation. 2.1 Suspensions and inks preparation process and characterisation An aqueous suspension of a submicron Al2O3 powder (CT3000-SG, Amaltis GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany), with an average particle size of D50 = 0.35 μm and 50 vol% of solids, was initially prepared by dispersing the powder in deionized water in presence of 1 wt% (based on the alumina solids amount) of Dolapix CE64 (Zimmer and Schwartz, Germany) [11]. The suspension was deagglomerated in a ball milling with alumina spheres (spheres to powder ratio of 3:1) for 24 h. This feedstock suspension was directly used to prepare alumina samples by slip casting (for comparison purposes) or after fine-tuned to obtain a proper ink for robocasting. For the ink preparation, 0.5 wt% (based on alumina solids amount) of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, 250 000 Mw, Colorobbia, Portugal) were used as a thickening agent of the suspension. This binder-assisted suspension was homogenized for 5 min at 800 rpm in a planetary centrifugal mixer (ARE-250, Thinky Co., Tokyo, Japan). Finally, different amounts of polyethyleneimine solution (PEI, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, Mn ~1800 and Mw ~2000), namely 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 wt%, were added to obtain extrudable inks with adequate stiffness. The final paste was mixed and degassed using again the planetary centrifugal mixer for an additional 5 min at 1000 rpm velocity to ensure high homogeneity. Suspension and inks were characterized by rheological properties using a rotational rheometer (Kinexus Pro+, Malvern, UK) at 25 °C, holding a solvent trap to prevent samples drying during experiments. The shear viscosity was measured using a cone/plate system (4°/40 mm) with a gap of 150 μm in the shear rate range of 0.1 to 600 s−1. Final alumina-based inks were characterized by amplitude sweep measurements at 1 Hz frequency in oscillatory mode, using a plate sensor (Φ = 20 mm), with a 1 mm gap size. 2.2 Alumina samples preparation by robocasting and slip casting A robocasting system (Model EBRD-A32, 3D Inks, LLC, USA) was used to print prismatic alumina bars with the as-prepared ink as feedstock material. The ink was loaded into a 5 ml syringe (Nordson, USA) and extruded through a nozzle with an internal diameter of 0.41 mm with 10 mm/s printing speed. The alumina specimens were constructed on a smooth alumina substrate. Two different printing conditions were used, both at room temperature, to ensure uniform drying during printing: (i) immersed in a low viscosity liquid paraffin (Benzina Química Internacional, Portugal) and (ii) in air within a high humidity level (around 85% relative humidity, RH). After printing, the alumina structures were dried at room temperature with controlled humidity for 24 h and then at 100 °C in an oven for 24 h. 3D models with different printing filament orientations were designed in RoboCAD software and then exported to G-code format. Suitable dimensions were used in the CAD models to attain standardized testing bars after sintering for mechanical properties with approximately 45 × 4 × 3 mm3 (length × height × width) [37]. Fig. 1 shows the CAD model of the three different printing configurations used in the production of the rectangular samples. Solid cast bars were also obtained by conventional slip casting in suitable plaster moulds, using the as-prepared alumina slurries with 50 vol%. After the de-moulding step, the slip casting samples were dried following the same procedure used to dry the AM samples. 2.3 Sintering and characterisation of the alumina samples All prismatic Al2O3 bars were sintered at 1550 °C using the following schedule: 2 °C/min heating rate until 600 °C, with 1 h holding time at this temperature to burn out the organic components; 2 °C/min heating rate up to 1000 °C with 1 h holding time and finally, 5 °C/min from 1000 °C to final sintering temperature (1550 °C) with 2 h holding time, followed by cooling to room temperature. The alumina samples with configuration and printing environment condition that presented the best results when sintered at 1550 °C/2 h have been selected to be also tested at 1600 °C/2 h following the same heating schedule. For comparison, both sintering temperatures (1550 °C/2 h and 1600 °C/2 h) were also used in slip casting samples. Linear shrinkage was measured in green (after drying step) and sintered samples, while the bulk density of all sintered structures was measured by Archimedes immersion method and relative density calculated using 3.98 g·cm−3 as the reference value for alumina. The mechanical strength of the specimens was measured by three-point flexural tests in a universal testing machine (AG-IS 10 kN, Shimadzu Corpor., Kyoto, Japan) according to the ASTM C1161–18 standard [37]. Tests were carried out in the perpendicular direction to the printing plane of the 3D structures at a constant speed of 0.5 mm·min−1. At least 10 samples were tested for each composition and property (namely shrinkage, bulk density and flexural strength) to obtain more reliable results and to access the variability of the measurements. The Young's modulus was measured by the dynamic and non-destructive impulse excitation technique (IEP, Grindosonic MK5i system Belgium) from two replicas of each sample, on the top side of each sintered specimen. Vickers hardness of sintered alumina samples was measured using a small fragment that was mounted in epoxy and polished to an optical finish. At least 10 indentations were made in each sample with 2 kgf as indentation load using a microhardness tester (Wilson VH1102, BUEHLER) and DiaMet Template hardness testing software. Morphological features and microstructure of the samples' cross-section in the fracture surface were analysed by an optical microscope with a camera (LEICA EZ4HD, Germany) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4100, Hitachi High-Technologies Europe, GmbH, Germany). 2.4 Numerical modelling and simulation Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Engineering (CAE) strategies were applied to understand and discuss the mechanical performance shown by the different alumina samples printed by robocasting with different infill orientations (R-A1, R-A2 and R-A3), using SOLIDWORKS 2020. For all prismatic bars' design, the same basic parameters were used, namely filament diameter of 0.41 mm, horizontal spacing of 0.37 mm and vertical spacing of 0.37 mm. The external envelope was the same for all the samples (7.440 × 55.170 × 6.422 mm3). In sequence, CAD modelling was used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the material. Representative Unit-Cells (RUCs) were tested to obtain a numerical reference for the effective anisotropic behaviour while bending tests provided a glimpse of local effects in terms of stress levels and their influence in the performance evaluation of these brittle heterogeneous materials. These RUCs were tested using the Finite Element Method (FEM) from the properties of Alumina (Al2O3) considering linear elasticity, i.e., a base material with Young's modulus of 380 GPa and Poisson's coefficient of 0.22. Quadratic tetrahedral elements (10 nodes, 30 degrees of freedom) were used. Each configuration was evaluated with a tensile test for each one of the three axes, imposing a prescribed displacement on each direction. The remaining boundary conditions were the same for all tests, with symmetry conditions (sliders) over the three opposing planes to promote a result as close as possible to the uniaxial. Additionally, the experimental results obtained for Young's modulus of different alumina samples obtained by robocasting (R-A1, R-A2 and R-A3) and slip casting (SC), sintered at both temperatures (1550 °C and 1600 °C), were analysed using the bound of Voigt [38] and the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman [39,40]. Briefly, for a base material with Young's modulus E 0 and porosity ϕ, the (upper) bound of Voigt is given by [41]. (1) E V = E 0 1 − ϕ . The upper bounds of Hashin-Shtrikman for the shear modulus G and bulk modulus K are given from the correspondent properties of the base material, G 0 and K 0, and the porosity ϕ, respectively by [41]. (2) G H S + = G 0 + − 1 G 0 + 1 − ϕ 6 K 0 + 2 G 0 5 G 0 3 K 0 + 4 G 0 − 1 ϕ and (3) K HS + = K 0 + − 1 K 0 + 1 − ϕ 3 3 K 0 + 4 G 0 − 1 ϕ . Based on these relations, it is possible to obtain an approximation for the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman for Young's modulus as (4) E HS + = 9 K HS + G HS + 3 K HS + + G HS + . Finally, the Mooney-type exponential relation [42] defined as (5) E PG = E 0 exp − 2 ϕ 1 − ϕ , is another prediction model for the relation of Young's modulus with porosity which corresponds to a semiempirical extension of the dilute approximations and allows modelling the non-linear dependence between these variables. Further information and a critical assessment of the model relations describing the porosity dependence on Young's modulus can be consulted in [43]. 3 Results This section starts with the presentation of the experimental results, including the characterisation of the inks followed by the description of the structural properties of alumina bars. Finally, the experimental results are compared with those obtained by numerical modelling and simulation. 3.1 Inks characterisation Robocasting imposes stringent requirements on the rheological behaviour of the pastes, being mandatory a trade-off between an easy flow through a narrow nozzle (small opening) and shape retention immediately after printing. Different strategies can be used for tailoring this type of rheological behaviour in ceramic suspensions, including: (i) gelation/thickening mechanisms during/after printing or (ii) producing the inks with desirable rheological behaviour before printing [28,44]. In the present work, the second approach was used. Fig. 2 (a) presents flow curves of the alumina suspensions (AS) having 50 vol% of solids in the absence and presence of different amounts of processing additives, i.e., CMC and PEI as the thickening and coagulating agents, respectively [28,29]. All suspensions show shear-thinning behaviour where the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate, indicating the presence of well-stabilized suspensions/inks with required behaviour to go ahead with printing [29,30,44]. The addition of CMC and PEI increases the viscosity of the suspension, highly noticeable when PEI is added, as expected. This behaviour confirms the strong coagulation effect of PEI mentioned in the literature [18,22,29,30,45], which was explained by the interaction of the cationic secondary and tertiary amino groups existing in the PEI with negatively charged functional groups of dispersant adsorbed at alumina particles (Dolapix CE64), neutralizing the charges, and consequently promoting particles connection. This reaction is accompanied by the transformation of the system (aqueous media + alumina particles + dispersant + CMC) from a viscous-like to a solid-like behaviour, i.e., fluid suspensions to pastes/inks. The considered amounts of PEI do not significantly change the flow behaviour of the inks, even if small variances could be observed in the evaluation of viscoelastic properties. Fig. 2(b) presents elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G″) as a function of the complex shear stress. All inks present higher elastic modulus than the viscous modulus, revealing a gel-like system, as predictable. Independently of the amount of PEI, all the inks stay stable over a wide range of applied shear stress, meaning high linear viscoelastic region (LVR), a good indication that the deposited filaments will be mechanically stable during the printing process with sufficient mechanical strength to support the weight of the next layers [29,30,44]. Furthermore, all inks display elastic modulus in the range of ~106–107 Pa, which are indicative values for printable inks for robocasting. At a certain value of applied shear stress, G″ intersects G′. This is the yield stress point, from which the rupture of the network formed between the polymeric matrix and the Al2O3 ceramic particles occurred, i.e., a gel transition from solid-like to liquid-like behaviour is succeeded. This interception occurs at higher shear stress values as the amount of PEI increases, meaning that stronger gel is formed. According to M'Barki et al. [44], the inks to print dense ceramics should have rheological properties different from those used to produce porous structures. For the dense structures, the cylindrical filaments extruded from the nozzles should flow enough after deposition to fill the gaps between their rod-like shape and to avoid the collapse of the printed part. Having this in mind, 0.2 wt% was the amount of PEI selected to go ahead with printing experiments. 3.2 Structural properties of alumina bars Fig. 3 (a–e) present relative density, percentage of linear shrinkage (from dried to sintered samples), flexural strength, Young's modulus and hardness of the alumina structures printed by robocasting (R) with the three infill orientations (Fig. 1, R-A1, R-A2 and R-A3) inside paraffin (P) and then sintered at 1550 °C during 2 h holding time (R-A1-P-1550, R-A2-P-1550 and R-A3-P-1550). The same properties were evaluated for R-A3 configuration printed in air at room temperature with controlled humidity (R-A3-Air), sintered at both temperatures, 1550 °C and 1600 °C (R-A3-Air-1550 and R-A3-Air-1600), for the same holding time (2 h). For comparison, results for analogous structures (shape and size) obtained by slip casting (SC) from the alumina suspensions containing 50 vol% and sintered at both temperatures (SC-1550 and SC-1600) are also presented. Concerning the samples printed inside paraffin (P) and sintered at 1550 °C/2 h, Fig. 3(a) shows that R-A1-P-1550 and R-A3-P-1550 present similar mean relative densities (≈96.5%), while R-A2-P-1550 presents the lowest average value (≈95%). When the R-A3 configuration structure was printed in air with a controlled humidity rate, keeping the sintering temperature (R-A3-Air-1550), an increase in the mean relative density (≈98%) was noticed. Increasing the sintering temperature to 1600 °C, the mean relative density of this later R-A3 configuration also increases (R-A3-Air-1600), reaching values around 99%. The average relative densities of these samples (R-A3-Air-1550 and R-A3-Air-1600) are comparable with those attained for the slip casting ones (SC-1550 and SC-1600) as reference conventional production process. As shown in Fig. 3(b), average linear shrinkage values in the range of 17–20% are obtained for structures fabricated by robocasting, with negligible changes between different infill orientations and sintering temperatures, while values around 15% are detected for SC samples. The shrinkage differences in robocasting specimens, when compared to SC, could be attributed to the presence of organic components in the printable inks (and dried specimens), which are burned out during sintering, causing higher retraction [32,46,47]. Shrinkage results for slip casting samples are in good agreement with the literature results, for high concentrated alumina suspensions (> 45 vol%) and sintering temperatures in the range of 1550–1600 °C [48]. Besides relative density, flexural strength and Young's modulus (Fig. 3(c,d)) are mechanical properties reliant on the printing strategy (in-fill configuration of filaments) and printing environment (paraffin bath or in air). Regarding hardness (Fig. 3(e)), similar values are obtained for all analysed samples (≈16–17 GPa) as typical for alumina ceramics sintered at 1550–1600 °C [49], without relevant changes between robocasting and SC samples. Hardness values are usually dependent on both density and grain size, and smaller grain size could enhance hardness [50,51].The differences observed in the samples' relative density (Fig. 5a) did not affect significantly the hardness values, since a microindenter was used. Additionally, the small increase of 50 °C in the sintering temperature (from 1550 to 1600 °C) was not expressively changing the grain size (as following presented in Fig. 5) which could explain the similar hardness values attained for all samples sintered at both temperatures. Fig. 3(c,d) show that longitudinal configuration of filaments (R-A3-P-1550) in robocasting alumina samples printed inside paraffin is the printing strategy that results in higher flexural strength and higher Young's modulus, while the transversal one (R-A2-P-1550) is that presenting lower values (all sintered at 1550 °C). Printing in air with controlled humidity (R-A3-Air-1550), instead of paraffin bath (R-A3-P-1550), and increasing sintering temperature to 1600 °C (R-A3-Air-1600) improve both properties, where flexural strength and Young's modulus reach mean values around 340–350 MPa and 350–360 GPa, respectively. These results are also in good agreement with densification results (shown in Fig. 3(a)). Furthermore, for a given printing strategy and condition, flexural strength exhibits high variability among the results obtained for samples fabricated by robocasting (clearer for the samples printed inside paraffin bath), when compared to the traditional colloidal-based SC method. To understand these results, the inner macrostructure of the different printed prismatic models was analysed in the cross-section of the bars cut off in the orthogonal direction to the longitudinal axis (Ox, Fig. 1). Fig. 4 presents the cross-section images for the robocasting structures with different in-fill patterns, printed in paraffin bath or at air and sintered at both 1550 °C and 1600 °C temperatures. Comparing R-A1-P-1550, R-A2-P-1550 and R-A3-P-1550, three different macrostructural features can be observed. The R-A1-P-1550 sample presents a high amount of porosity near the side walls/bounding box perimeter of the bar. Oppositely, in the R-A2-P-1550 structure, macropores were not detected in this cutting direction, being instead highly visible the bonds between the different layers/filaments. Both macrostructural features noted in the above-mentioned ones were not visible in R-A3-P-1550 structure, even though porosity between filaments in the first printed layers was detected. Printing this last patterning in air, the porosity in the first layers disappeared, resulting in a highly homogeneous macrostructure, similar for both sintering temperatures (R-A3-Air-1550 and R-A3-Air-1600). These macrostructural features are shown with higher detail in the SEM images presented in Fig. 5 . For all different samples, the first images correlate well with the observations from Fig. 4. Looking in more detail at the porosity, it is possible to observe two types of pores (shape and size) depending on the in-fill orientation and patterning design used for alumina bars fabrication. As already mentioned, R-A1 printing patterning (constituted by two consecutive layers with printed filaments in two directions, 0 and 90°) results in a mixture of different pore sizes (voids) and shapes, highly visible between the perimeter filament of the bounding box and the contiguous inner region of the bar. Additionally, the poor connection between the filaments printed in different directions from the consecutive layers results in a pore with a triangular shape, due to the patterning formed by the filaments ordered in different directions and their respective rod-like shape. When all layers are printed with filaments in the Ox direction (0°, R-A3-P-1550), the pores presented a rhombus shape, resulting from the void space formed between the 4 rod-like filaments. No porosity is visible in the cross-section of the bars printed with R-A2 configuration (R-A2-P-1550), while if the sample was cut in the Ox printing direction a similar pore shape and size as that observed for the R-A3-P-1550 sample should be evident. Looking at the microstructure inside filaments (picture with high ampliation in Fig. 5) it is highly similar in the R-A1-P-1550, R-A2-P-1550 and R-A3-P-1550, as well as R-A3-Air-1550 samples, as expected. Increasing sintering temperature to 1600 °C (R-A3-Air-1600) the microstructure does not present significative changes in respect to the grain size, although microporosity may be lower according to the densification results (Fig. 3(a)). On the one hand, the low amounts of organic binders used in the paste preparation (CMC and PEI) could explain the absence of high perceptible porosity inside filaments. On the other hand, paraffin could be responsible for some bigger porosity (essentially the one observed in the first printed layers of R-A3-P-1550, Fig. 4), since it might fill some of the gaps between filaments during printing, getting imprisoned inside the green structure and consequently avoiding the filament's paste relaxation after printing to allow filling these voids. As an organic component, it can be burned out during the sintering step using a slower heating schedule, although it was not enough to eliminate high dimensional pores. For comparison purposes, and as expected, the samples obtained by slip casting sintered at 1550 °C and 1600 °C (SC-1550 and SC-1600) present a uniform macrostructure (Fig. 6 (a,c)). The microstructure for both samples (Fig. 6(b,d)) is similar to that observed for the robocasting samples (Fig. 5), both exhibiting small pores inside the grains and grain boundaries, in accordance with relative density values (Fig. 3(a)). Increasing temperature from 1550 °C to 1600 °C the grain growth is not highly perceptible as observed for R-A3-Air-1550 and R-A3-Air-1600 (Fig. 5). 3.3 Numerical evaluation of anisotropy Fig. 7 presents the SOLIDWORKS 2020 geometric approximations of the bars printed by robocasting, according to the different in-fill orientations (R-A1, R-A2 and R-A3). Volume fractions of material resulted in 0.9215 for the longitudinal arrangement (R-A3), 0.9241 for the transversal (R-A2) and 0.9488 for the alternating orthogonal one (R-A1). Two base RUC were extracted from these geometric approximations for simulation, as shown in Fig. 8 . The resulting volume fractions were now 0.9276 for the uniaxial arrangement (R-A2 and R-A3) and 0.9532 for the alternating orthogonal one (R-A1). These values are slightly higher than those presented for R-A1, R-A2 and R-A3 bars (Fig. 7) because of the outer layers of the latter. The analysis of average displacements and reaction loads/stresses provide information to evaluate not only the effective Young's modulus of the materials for the three orthogonal axes (Ox, Oy and Oz) but also to evaluate the Poisson coefficient for the respective planes. These are shown in Table 1 , where E ef is the effective Young's modulus, E fr the base material value scaled down to the volume fraction (theoretical maximum), and ν ij each of the Poisson's ratios. The first take from these values is the fact that these materials are effectively anisotropic. As expected, the stiffness for the unidirectional arrangement along the filament axis (R-A2 and R-A3) is equal to the theoretical maximum for a parallel arrangement (see Eq. (1)). For this RUC, it is also notable that, for the transversal directions, the more compact arrangement along the Oz axis leads to a higher stiffness when compared to the Oy axis. As for the alternating orthogonal arrangement (R-A1), it presents a stiffer behaviour in Oz when compared to the unidirectional due to the material continuity provided by the arrangement (according to Fig. 8). More interesting is the fact that it presents isotropic behaviour in the Oxy plane, which is shown both by Young's modulus and Poisson's coefficient values [52]. Fig. 9 shows the deformed shapes and (normalized) axial stress distributions for the components on the unidirectional (Ox) and bidirectional (Ox and Oy) printing. Isovalues show, as expected, a much more homogeneous response for the filaments aligned with the loading, following a parallel distribution and a stiffer behaviour. For the one-dimensional topology, this direction is much stiffer than the others, where the series arrangement provides a worse response. An intermediate case can be expected for the bidirectional arrangement (R-A1), where a behaviour close to transversally isotropic (tetragonal, in fact) is shown. For both arrangements, the direction orthogonal to the printing plane offers the worse stiffness results. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 10 , the filament interaction for the bidirectional arrangement (R-A1) is more three-dimensional, with a more consistent material distribution that provides a more continuous stress distribution and, as previously stated, a stiffer response. Considering the volume fractions of the material obtained from these geometric approximations, a theoretical porosity (assuming no filaments' deformation during printing and sintering processes) was calculated. Fig. 11 presents experimental versus theoretical porosity values for the alumina samples. For all robocasting specimens, the experimental values for porosity are lower than the theoretical ones (in particular for R-A3), as expected from the rheological behaviour of the inks (Fig. 2). After deposition, the ink filament can slightly flow, changing from a perfect cylindrical shape to a more elliptic one and, consequently, filling the void space between filaments and reducing porosity level. Also, R-A3 specimens present a relevant decrease in the experimental porosity when the sintering temperature increases from 1550 °C to 1600 °C. This result was expected, and it is in good agreement with the increased relative density values (Fig. 3) and observed microstructures (Fig. 5) for samples sintered at 1600 °C. Slip casting samples are considered as control bulk material and their relative density is expected to be 100% (i.e., theoretical porosity 0%). However, the existence of small defects (e.g., due to air bubbles in the suspension and/or poor particles' packing behaviour in some parts of the samples) are common in SC procedures [11,53], which could explain the existence of 1–2% of porosity in experimental samples (small pores, Fig. 6) and so, the presence of SC samples in the opposite way to robocasting in Fig. 11. 4 Discussion Printing defects as observed in the present work have been recently mentioned by M. Orlovská et al. [54] in alumina ceramics prepared by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). The authors mentioned that voids between filaments appeared for different reasons: (i) solid layers and bounding box of the structure (perimeters) encircle the inner structure, (ii) layer thickness and (iii) weak interfaces between adjacent paths. Although the authors used a different technique, where binder amounts are higher and binder burnout could also be responsible for the formation of defects, the reasons appointed for the macroporosity (porosity between filaments) could fit the results attained in the present work. Robocasting uses negligible amounts of binders when compared to FFF as an advantage to decrease defects, while the rheological behaviour of the ink could be fine-tuned to fill voids between filaments after printing, improving material packing and densification. In fact, the resultant macrostructure as a consequence of the different printing patterns and combination of layer paths has a straight connection with mechanical properties and have been also studied by other authors using other AM technologies and ceramic materials [55,56]. Regarding the variability of results on the flexural strength tests (Fig. 3(c)) for the calculation of effective properties such as stiffness, rendering them less reliable for ceramics – especially with heterogeneous topologies resulting from AM strategies – a numerical evaluation was performed to support this discussion. The modelled samples were simplified, using an adequate level of detail for this analysis. Accurate models have computational requirements that render them unfeasible for meshing and analysis, while not providing better information when compared with the reduced models presented here. Fig. 12 shows the geometries used for these studies, for bending over the Oy axis. Filament diameter and distribution parameters are the same as before, while the envelope dimensions are 1.75 × 17.7 × 1.89 mm3. Despite the same envelope, material volume fractions are different, with 0.89 for the longitudinal (Ox) layout and 0.92 for the transversal (Oy) one. These analyses are also undertaken within the bounds of linear elasticity. In this sense, the absolute levels of stress and the overall response are always proportional to the imposed state and absolute values ignored, taken in comparative form for the sake of the discussion. The isovalues of the von Mises stress distribution are shown in Fig. 12. The transversal arrangement showed a stiffer response than the longitudinal one, with the differences in stiffness much higher than the differences in volume fraction and more pronounced than for the RUC. This means that the influence of material distribution increases with the complexity of the loading and resulting stress states. One of the factors which can be verified is that the average cross-section is higher for the transversal one, a determining factor for the behaviour in bending. It also ends up having more material the farthest from the neutral plane, rendering a stiffer response. At the same time, partly connected to this, it tends to generate higher peak stresses. This is, in fact, the focus of this study. Not in terms of the value itself, albeit over 15% higher, but in the fact that these peaks appear not on the extremes of the cross-section, as shown for the more conventional response of the aligned longitudinal filaments, but as multiple localized peaks within the transitions between transversal filaments. This is compatible with phenomena of stress concentration [57], which, as expected, is shown to be much more critical for the transversal configuration, consistent also with the distributions seen on the RUC. The multiple transitions between filaments, dependant not only on the global topology but also on the local effects, created multiple nucleation places for stress concentration. This is made even more critical for inherently heterogeneous materials as ceramics, with the added impact of printing variability superimposed by heating and densification variability. This is part of the explanation for the variability of results for the experimental tests, especially for specimens with transversal filament deposition, where every small geometric and process deviation leads to stress peaks, which, for such fragile materials, lead to a premature failure. The variation of Young's modulus (for the different alumina samples printed by robocasting) can be analysed with respect to the porosity experimentally obtained and theoretically predicted (calculated in the geometric approximations, Fig. 7). For that, Fig. 13 (a) presents the experimental Young's modulus vs. experimental porosity obtained for the robocasting and SC samples, together with the analytical bound of Voigt and upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman for both sintering temperatures (1550 °C and 1600 °C). As expected, Young's moduli of the robocasting specimens are below the bounds obtained for the corresponding sintering temperatures. However, those of the slip casting specimens slightly surpass the bounds which can be explained by the slight overestimation of the corresponding experimental porosity. On the other hand, Fig. 13(a) also shows that Young's modulus values are close to the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman for the R-A3 specimens sintered at 1600 °C. Regarding the different robocasting specimens, Young's modulus is higher for the R-A3 specimens, which can be explained by the longitudinal nature of the filaments, while for both R-A1 and R-A2 specimens the experimental results are substantially lower, being this characteristic more relevant for the R-A2 specimen than for the R-A1 one. This can be explained by the existence of transversal filaments, which, in the presence of defects (e.g., weak interfilament bonding, air bubbles) leads to a strong degradation of the longitudinal stiffness of the specimens. Fig. 13(b) presents both experimental and numerical results for Young's modulus as a function of porosity, the analytical bound of Voigt and the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman (H-S UB), and the Mooney-type exponential relation (M-T ER) of Pabst-Gregorová for all samples sintered at 1550 °C. Note that the numerical results are obtained by finite element analyses and correspond to the stiffness values in the longitudinal direction of the specimens. Fig. 13(b) shows that the numerical and experimental values for Young's modulus are quite close, although the numerical values of the porosity are greater than those experimental. This difference between numerical and experimental porosity can be largely explained by the densification due to the flow of the material in real specimens. On the other hand, the numerical values for Young's modulus of the robocasting specimens are, as expected, below the corresponding bound of Voigt and the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman. The exception is the R-A3 specimen, whose result is above the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman, corresponding to the value given by the bound of Voigt. Finally, the experimental result for the R-A3 specimens and the numerical result for the R-A1 specimen are in good agreement with the analytical predictions of the Mooney-type exponential relation, being the R-A1 and R-A2 experimental results and the R-A2 numerical results below the analytical predictions. 5 Final remarks and conclusions Robocasting was successfully used to print dense alumina ceramics by fine-tuning the rheological properties of the inks, infill orientation of filaments and environment during the printing process. The CMC and PEI mixture (0.5 wt% and 0.2 wt%) in a 50 vol% solids suspension resulted in a feedstock with proper rheological behaviour during printing and with the ability to flow after deposition to fill the gaps in-between filaments. The in-fill orientation of the filaments influenced the mechanical properties of the sintered parts, namely flexural strength and Young's modulus, with optimal performance observed for specimens with longitudinal filament's printing in all consecutive layers. Printing environment (paraffin bath or air with controlled humidity) and sintering temperature (1550 °C or 1600 °C) also determined relative density and consequently, the mechanical properties. Alumina samples, printed with longitudinal configuration, in air with controlled humidity and sintered at 1600 °C for 2 h exhibited mean relative density around 99%. The values attained for mean flexural strength (≈350 MPa), Young's modulus (≈366 GPa) and hardness (≈17 GPa) were comparable to those obtained for slip casting samples produced with the same sintering conditions. The numerical results presented in this work were used to provide further insight into the anisotropic material behaviour of the printed alumina specimens. The different RUC arrangements showed the influence of the printing strategies on the stiffness of these materials, with values that range from the theoretical maximum obtained for the axial filament alignment to lower values that depend strongly on the printing parameters. Furthermore, bending tests with different orientation showed that, while in accordance with the microscale analysis, the overall response of printed parts is much more dependent on the material configuration as a whole and (macro)scale effects. Moreover, critical for ceramic materials, stress concentration proved to be a factor that might lead to a dispersion of results on experimental tests. Finally, the experimental results for Young's modulus were compared with the bound of Voigt-Reuss and the upper bound of Hashin-Shtrikman, as well as with the analytical predictions of a Mooney-type exponential relation, and were shown to be generally in accordance with the observed experimental facts.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Although regulatory improvements for air quality in the European Union have been made, air pollution is still a pressing problem and, its impact on health, both mortality and morbidity, is a topic of intense research nowadays. The main goal of this work is to assess the impact of the exposure to air pollutants on the number of daily hospital admissions due to respiratory causes in 58 spatial locations of Portugal mainland, during the period 2005-2017. To this end, INteger Generalised AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (INGARCH)based models are extensively used. This family of models has proven to be very useful in the analysis of serially dependent count data. Such models include information on the past history of the time series, as well as the effect of external covariates. In particular, daily hospitalisation counts, air quality and temperature data are endowed within INGARCH models of optimal orders, where the automatic inclusion of the most significant covariates is carried out through a new block-forward procedure. The INGARCH approach is adequate to model the outcome variable (respiratory hospital admissions) and the covariates, which advocates for the use of count time series approaches in this setting. Results show that the past history of the count process carries very relevant information and that temperature is the most determinant covariate, among the analysed, for daily hospital respiratory admissions. It is important to stress that, despite the small variability explained by air quality, all models include on average, approximately two air pollutants covariates besides temperature. Further analysis shows that the one-step-ahead forecasts distributions are well separated into two clusters: one cluster includes locations exclusively in the Lisbon area (exhibiting higher number of one-step-ahead hospital admissions forecasts), while the other contains the remaining locations. This results highlights that special attention must be given to air quality in Lisbon metropolitan area in order to decrease the number of hospital admissions.",

This split-mouth randomised controlled trial sequentially enrolled 12 patients with a 6-month follow-up. For each patient, a simultaneous randomised bilateral maxillary sinus lift was performed and filled with autologous bone from the mandible (control) or a porcine xenograft (test). A bone biopsy sample was collected during the implant placement for histological and histomorphometric analysis. CT scans were performed at the beginning and at the end of the trial to assess radiological evolution. A comparison of initial and six-month CT scans indicated statistically significant increases in bone level for both materials (7.8 ± 2.4 mm for autologous and 8.7 ± 2.2 mm for xenograft, p < 0.05), and there were no significant differences between the performance of the two materials over time (p = 0.26). The histological analysis showed various stages of the remodelling process and no cells or other signs of inflammation or infection were visible in both groups. The porcine xenografts presented similar results for the studied variables when compared to autologous bone, being a reasonable alternative for a sinus lift.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the direct and semi-direct aerosol effects on weather forecasting, focusing on the Iberian Peninsula (IP). To that end, two Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Chem simulations (with and without aerosol feedback) for an entire year (2015) were performed. The model setup includes two nested domains run in two-way mode, allowing the downscaling for the IP domain at a 5 × 5 km2 high-horizontal resolution. The results were explored through agreement of pairs of time series and their spatial variability in order to analyse the importance of including the online-coupled aerosol radiative effect on the meteorological variables: Shortwave (solar) radiation, air temperature and precipitation. Significant variations of agreement were found when capturing both temporal and spatial patterns of the analysed meteorological variables. While the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation is similar throughout the IP domain, with agreement values ranging from 0.87 up to 1.00, the solar radiation presents a distinct spatial pattern with lower agreement values (0.68–0.75) over ocean and higher agreement (0.75–0.98) over land regions. With regard to the spatial differences between simulations, the aerosol contributed to a considerable decrease in annual mean and maximum radiation (up to 20 and 40Wm-2, respectively), slightly impacting the temperature variation (up to 0.5°C). These results suggest that the aerosol feedback effects should be accounted when performing weather forecasts, and not only for purposes of air quality assessment.",

All rights reserved.Background:Induction of anesthesia and the knee-chest position are associated with hemodynamic changes that may impact patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess whether planned reductions in target-controlled infusion propofol concentrations attenuate the hemodynamic changes associated with anesthesia induction and knee-chest position.Materilas and Methods:A total of 20 patients scheduled for elective lumbar spinal surgery in the knee-chest position were included. In addition to standard anesthesia monitoring, bispectral index and noninvasive cardiac output (CO) monitoring were undertaken. The study was carried out in 2 parts. In phase 1, target-controlled infusion propofol anesthesia was adjusted to maintain BIS 40 to 60. In phase 2, there were 2 planned reductions in propofol target concentration: (1) immediately after loss of consciousness - reduction calculated using a predefined formula, and (2) before positioning - reduction equal to the average percentage decrease in CO after knee-chest position in phase 1. Changes from baseline in CO and other hemodynamic variables following induction of anesthesia and knee-chest positioning were compared.Results:Induction of anesthesia led to decreases of 25.6% and 19.8% in CO from baseline in phases 1 and 2, respectively (P<0.01). Knee-chest positioning resulted in a further decrease such that the total in CO reduction from baseline to 10 minutes after positioning was 38.4% and 46.9% in phases 1 and 2, respectively (P<0.01). There was no difference in CO changes between phases 1 and 2, despite the planned reductions in propofol during phase 2. There was no significant correlation between changes in CO and mean arterial pressure.Conclusions:Planned reductions in propofol concentration do not attenuate anesthesia induction and knee-chest position-related decreases in CO. The knee-chest position is an independent risk factor for decrease in CO. Minimally invasive CO monitors may aid in the detection of clinically relevant hemodynamic changes and guide management in anesthetized patients in the knee-chest position.",

The goal of this work is to analyse the agreement between projections of the CLMCOM-CCLM4-8-17 (CLMCOM) and SMHI-RCA4 (SMHI) models across Europe. The variables temperature, precipitation and solar radiation were considered for a historical period (1971–2005) and for a future scenario (2006–2040). The overall agreement (A) is defined as the normalised area of the magnitude-squared coherence function over the frequency range (averaged over time), being 0 for no agreement and 1 for total agreement between models. The relative mean difference (M) and difference between the coefficients of variation (V) are also explored, since coherence analysis cannot evaluate differences in mean and variability. Agreement values ranging from 0.32 to 0.74, 0.28 to 0.69 and 0.32 to 0.58 were found for temperature, precipitation and solar radiation, respectively, for the historical period. In all cases, the results show better agreement for lower than higher frequencies. Overall, the time series from both models behave fairly similarly for lower frequencies (i.e. the trend of the time series), while for higher frequencies (i.e. rapid changes in the time series), the similarities between the models are less consistent. For temperature, the M and V values are smaller than 2.5%, while for precipitation and solar radiation they can exceed 50% and 35%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that the contribution of winter and summer differs considerably for M and V values. In conclusion, it seems that such models can provide fairly similar results when considering long periods of time.",

Moreover, the two mandibular canine teeth must be available, which is not always a viable option. The aim of this study was to strip the MCI by analyzing the MCI itself and its components, in order to optimize its use for sex estimation. The mesiodistal dimensions of the mandibular canine crown and the mandibular canine arch width were measured in a sample of 120 cast models. Five predictor variables were considered in this study: the standard MCI, a variation of the MCI using the left canine, and MCI components (MD43, MD33 and D33–43). Multivariate binary logistic regression was performed using stepwise forward approach to select the most statistical relevant variables on the probability of a cast being from a female. The estimated probability was then analyzed with respect to performance in sex classification (ROC analysis and optimal cut-offs accuracy) and compared with the performance of the univariate variables. MCI43 and MCI33 presented the lowest performance (64.2% and 63.3% respectively), and the highest overall accuracy was attained using the MD43 and MD33 (85.8% in both cases). The multivariate logistic model obtained (using MD43 and MD33) exhibited the same accuracy as the logistic model based solely on MD43 (85.8%). Our results suggest that MD43 should be used instead of MCI for sex estimation.",

Physiological variables, such as changes in cardiac output (CO), can influence propofol pharmacokinetics. Knee-chest (KC) surgical positioning can result in CO changes. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between propofol plasma concentration prediction and CO changes after induction and KC positioning. Methods: This two-phase prospective cohort study included 20 patients scheduled for spinal surgery. Two different TCI anesthesia protocols were administered after induction. In phase I (n = 9), the loss of consciousness (LOC) concentration was set as the propofol target concentration and CO changes following induction and KC positioning were quantified. In phase II (n = 11), based on data from phase I, two reductions in the propofol target concentration on the pump were applied after LOC and before KC positioning. Propofol plasma concentrations were measured at different moments in both phases: after induction and after KC positioning. Results: Schnider Pk model showed a good performance in predicting propofol concentration after induction; however, after KC positioning, when a significant drop in CO occurred, the measured propofol concentrations were markedly underestimated. Intended reductions in the propofol target concentration did not attenuate HD changes. In the KC position, there was no correlation between the propofol concentration estimated by the Pk model and the measured concentration in plasma, as the latter was much higher (P = 0.013) while CO and BIS decreased significantly (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Conclusions: Our study showed that the measured propofol plasma concentrations during the KC position were significantly underestimated by the Schnider Pk model and were associated with significant CO decrease. When placing patients in the KC position, anesthesiologists must be aware of pharmacokinetic changes and, in addition to standard monitoring, the use of depth of anesthesia and cardiac output monitors may be considered in high-risk patients.",

However, many globular proteins show low susceptibility to the action of this enzyme. High-pressure processing (HPP), being able to change protein conformation, may be a useful tool to increase the accessibility of globular proteins to the action of MTG. Nevertheless, HPP conditions need to be carefully optimized to avoid the expected decrease of enzymatic activity observed above certain conditions of pressure (P), treatment time (t) or temperature (T). Pressure inactivation of MTG under different HPP conditions (200–600 MPa; 20–40 °C; 10–30 min) was evaluated employing a face-centered composite design at four different pH values (4–7). The regression models obtained presented high coefficients of determination and high F values, although they could not explain some of the associated variability. At all the pH values tested, the three main factors (P, T, and t) significantly (p < 0.05) affected the activity of MTG. At least 20% of MTG was inactivated when low pressures (200 MPa) were used at pH 4 and 5, whereas a higher pressure above 400 MPa was needed to obtain a similar inactivation at pH 6 or 7. MTG pressure-inactivation followed first-order kinetics under all tested conditions. Inactivation rate constants decreased with increasing pressure at constant temperature and pH 4, with a positive activation volume (Va), while the opposite was verified for the other pH values. Both activation energy (Ea) and Va were dependent on pH, however, at the lower pH values, Ea and Va did not vary significantly with pressure and temperature, respectively. Overall, MTG can be considered relatively resistant to pressure, particularly near its optimal pH.",

The formation of additional intra- and/or intermolecular cross-links between proteins, promoted by MTG during food processing, may cause changes in the techno-functional properties of proteins, and consequently in the appearance and texture of food systems (Motoki & Seguro 1998). Several reviews have been written over the past few years discussing the characteristics and applications of MTG on food products (de Góes-Favoni & Bueno 2014; Gaspar & de Góes-Favoni 2015; Kieliszek & Misiewicz 2014). The compact structure of certain proteins (e.g., β-lactoglobulin or lysozyme) often leads to a reduced accessibility of MTG to their reactive residues (glutamines and lysines). High-pressure changes the structural organization of proteins (Ledward 2000) and thus can expose otherwise inaccessible MTG's target residues, which are buried within the protein tertiary structure. In fact, high-pressure processing (HPP) impact on proteins' functional properties by breaking and reforming intra- and intermolecular interactions such as hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds and the separation of ion pairs. These changes, including the expected protein denaturation, are dependent on the pressure level, treatment time and temperature, but also on pH, ionic strength, solvent and protein concentration (Akasaka 2014; Boonyaratanakornkit, Park, & Clark 2002). Hence, there has been a growing interest in combining HPP with MTG to optimize the enzyme action and to achieve the desired improvement of food characteristics, mainly textural properties. HPP treatments typically increase the polymerization activity of MTG towards different proteins (Nonaka, Ito, Sawa, Motoki, & Nio 1997). This strategy was already successfully tested in egg (Ma, Lozano-Ojalvo, Chen, Lopez-Fandiño, & Molina 2015) and dairy proteins (Menéndez, Schwarzenbolz, Partschefeld, & Henle 2009), and also in fish (Herranz, Tovar, Borderias, & Moreno 2013) and meat products (Trespalacios & Pla 2007). The successful application of MTG-HPP combined strategies requires in-depth knowledge of the effect of HPP on MTG activity. HPP effects on the catalytic activity of enzymes are diverse and dependent on a set of factors, which include the origin of the enzyme, nature of substrates, medium composition (pH, salts, food matrix) and processing conditions (pressure, temperature, time, single- or multi-cycle processes). In general, due to the structural changes caused by high pressures, there is a change in enzyme functionality (catalytic activity and substrate specificity) that in most cases results in decreased activity, especially for pressures above 400 MPa. Nevertheless, enzyme activation has been described, especially for relatively low pressures (up to 300 MPa) (; Chakraborty, Kaushik, Rao, & Mishra 2014; Eisenmenger & Reyes-De-Corcuera 2009). Regarding MTG stability under high pressure, the enzyme typically showed a moderate resistance to pressure if compared to other enzymes (e.g., polygalacturonase from tomato which can be almost fully inactivated at around 400 MPa (Rodrigo et al. 2006) whereas peroxidase from horseradish requires 1 GPa for a ~40% inactivation (Préstamo, Arabas, Fonberg-Broczek, & Arroyo 2001). Different degrees of inactivation of MTG were reported for pressures of 500 MPa and above (Lauber, Krause, Klostermeyer, & Henle 2003; Lauber, Noack, Klostermeyer, & Henle 2001; Lee & Park 2002; Nonaka et al. 1997), depending on the HPP time and environmental conditions. Pressure inactivation of enzymes occurs accordingly to a complex mechanism where the major driven force is the volume reduction. The increase of pressure leads to the loss of empty spaces between protein chains (cavities), exposing otherwise unexposed side chains to the solvent that are consequently hydrated, causing proteins to unfold (Meersman, Smeller, & Heremans 2006), and in the case of enzymes, rendering them inactive. The inactivation process associated to protein unfolding is accompanied by conformational changes at different levels and of variable extent, depending on the enzyme, the environment and the HPP conditions (Boonyaratanakornkit et al. 2002). Different mechanisms for pressure-induced stabilization and activation of enzymes have been described as well, related to changes in intermolecular interactions, mainly stabilization of hydrogen bonds, disruption of bound water and hydration of charged groups (Eisenmenger & Reyes-De-Corcuera 2009). Resistance of MTG to pressure is closely related to the structure of the native enzyme, which is constituted by eleven α-helix and eight β-strands, seven of which form a β-sheet in the center of the enzyme that is surrounded by the α-helices (Kashiwagi, & Yokoyama, K. -I., Ishikawa, K., Ono, K., Ejima, D., Matsui, H., & Suzuki, E. -I. 2002). In a general way, β-sheets are less prone to be affected by pressure than α-helices (Gross & Jaenicke 1994), which in the specific case of MTG means that the center of the enzyme should be stable under relatively high-pressure. From the structural changes observed at higher pressures, the pressure-induced inactivation process is likely associated with a loss of tertiary structure and a rupture of α-helix elements, whereas the β-strands domains where the enzyme active center is located are much more stable against high pressures, thus explaining the relatively high pressure-resistance of the enzyme (Menéndez, Rawel, Schwarzenbolz, & Henle 2006). Available data regarding the activity and stability of MTG at different pH suggest that the enzyme is stable within a pH range of 5–9, with an optimal pH around 6–7, depending on the source and purification method of the MTG (Ando et al. 1989; Lu, Zhou, Tian, Li, & Chen 2003). As far as the authors are aware, there are no published kinetic data available for the MTG's pressure inactivation at different pH values, an important information as MTG can be used in different food system with distinct pH values. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to provide insight through an integrated study about the effect of several combined factors (pressure, holding time, and temperature) on the inactivation of MTG at different pH values. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Activa® Transglutaminase (100 U·g−1; 1 U is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol hydroxamate from hydroxylamine and carbobenzoxy-L-glutaminylglycine per min at pH 6.0, 37 °C) was a kind from Ajinomoto Foods Europe SAS (Hamburg, Germany). γ-Glutamyl donor substrate (Z-glutaminylglycin (Z-Gln-Gly)) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Hydroxylamine was obtained from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Glutathione was purchased from Chemopharma (Vienna, Austria). All other reagents were of analytical grade. 2.2 Experimental design and modeling The experimental design adopted to analyze the effect of high-pressure processing conditions (pressure, temperature, holding time) on the inactivation of MTG at different pH (4, 5, 6 and 7) was a face-centered composite design. Previous studies on MTG inactivation served as the basis for the screening of the factors and corresponding levels. The chosen lower limit for pressure was 200 MPa, considering that MTG is resistant to pressure and very little inactivation is observable below this value (Lauber et al. 2001; Menéndez et al. 2006), whereas 600 MPa was chosen as the upper limit, since it is the maximum pressure for industrial HPP equipment (Balasubramaniam, Martínez-Monteagudo, & Gupta 2015). Regarding the temperature, the lower level was defined as 20 °C, as one of the main advantages of HPP is being a non-thermal technology, and the upper level was set at 40 °C since it is near MTG's optimal temperature at atmospheric pressure (Ando et al. 1989). Concerning the holding time, the lower level was defined as 10 min since the extent of the MTG inactivation bellow this time is small (Lauber et al. 2001; Menéndez et al. 2006), and the upper level was defined as 30 min since it is generally accepted that HPP treatments during longer times are commercially impracticable. A set of 20 experiments, including 6 replicates at the central point, were performed in randomized order. The samples were treated in triplicates and analyzed in duplicates. The response, i.e. the residual activity (A r ), was defined as (Eq. 1): (1) A r = A t A 0 where A t is the activity at time t and A 0 the activity of the untreated enzyme. At the end of the experiment, 60 observations of the residual enzymatic activity A r were obtained for each pH level, by setting different experimental values of pressure (P), temperature (T) and treatment time (t). For the description of the response, A r , a quadratic polynomial equation (Eq. 2) and its subsets were evaluated. The general formulation of the model was as follows: (2) Y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 n β i x i + ∑ i = 1 n β ii x i 2 + ∑ i < j ∑ β ij x i x j where Y is the response (dependent variable), n is the number of independent variables, β 0 , β i , β ii , and β ij are model coefficients, and x i and x j are the independent variables (Baş & Boyacı 2007). In this work, one regression model was constructed for each pH level, by setting Y = A r at the corresponding pH, considering n 3 with x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 representing dimensionless coded forms of pressure, temperature, and holding time, respectively. 2.3 Sample preparation Solutions of 0.04 g mL−1 of Activa® transglutaminase were prepared in McIlvaine buffer at acidic (4, 5 and 6) and neutral pH (7), placed in polyethylene tubes and kept at 4 °C until HPP (up to 24 h). 2.4 Pressure treatments The MTG samples were treated at the conditions defined in Table 1 , using a hydrostatic press (FPG7100, Stanstead Fluid Power, Stanstead, United Kingdom). This equipment has a pressure vessel of 100 mm inner diameter and 250 mm height surrounded by an external jacket to control the temperature. The pressurization fluid was a mixture (60:40) of water and propylene glycol. The vessel and samples were previously conditioned for 15 min to the temperature of the treatment. The increase of temperature due to adiabatic heating was approximately 4 °C for every 100 MPa, decreasing in about 5 min to the set temperature. The compression and decompression rates were c.a. 250 MPa min−1 and 450 MPa min−1, respectively. 2.5 Enzyme activity measurement After the HPP treatments, the samples were kept at 4 °C, and the MTG activity was measured using the method described by Folk and Cole (1966) with a few modifications. MTG solution (50 μL) in McIlvaine buffer was added to 100 μL of substrate solution (containing 0.1 M hydroxylamine, 10 mM glutathione, 30 mM CBZ-L-glutaminylglycine, in McIlvaine buffer at pH 6.0) and incubated 10 min at 37 °C. Then the reaction was stopped using 100 μL of ferric chloride-trichloracetic acid reagent (1 vol 12% HCl, 1 vol 12% trichloroacetic, and 1 vol 5% ferric trichloride solution in 0.1 M HCl) and the resultant color was measured at 525 nm using a spectrophotometer (Microplate Spectrophotometer Multiskan Go, Thermo Scientific, USA). The enzyme activity was expressed as the change in absorbance per unit of time (min) and per unit volume (mL) of the enzyme solution (4 U MTG/mL). 2.6 Kinetic data calculation Inactivation of MTG followed a first-order kinetics, with the decrease of enzyme activity with time being described by, (3) A t = A 0 e − tk and thus (4) lnA t = ln A 0 − kt (5) ln A r = − k × t where A t is the enzymatic activity at time t; A 0 is initial activity, A r is the residual enzymatic activity (A t /A 0), t is the treatment time and k is the first-order inactivation rate constant. The inactivation first-order rate constants (k, min−1) were computed from A r generated by the respective model at different pressure/temperature combinations. The rate constant was used to describe the temperature and pressure dependence of the MTG inactivation kinetics. The temperature dependence was characterized using the linear form of the Arrhenius Eq. (6): (6) ln k = ln A − E a R 1 T Where A is the frequency factor, E a is the activation energy (J·mol−1), T is the experimental temperature (K), and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J·mol−1·K−1). The pressure dependence was characterized using the linear form of the Eyring Eq. (7): (7) ln k = ln k ref − V a R × T P − P ref where P and P ref are experimental and reference pressures (MPa), respectively, V a is the activation volume (cm3 mol−1), k and k ref are the inactivation rates (min−1) at P and P ref (0.1 MPa), respectively, T is the experimental temperature (K) and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1·K−1). 2.7 Statistical analysis The regression models were constructed using a stepwise procedure where the variables were included or removed from the model based on its p-value (and a significance of α = 0.05). The iterative method ended when no more variables were eligible for inclusion or removal. The coefficients of the model were estimated by maximum likelihood. Their standard errors and p-values were used to inspect the statistical significance of the coefficients. The model summary statistics included model significance, model goodness of fit and model predictive ability. The statistical significance of the regression models was assessed through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the evaluation of the F statistics and its significance. The goodness of fit was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (0% ≤ R2 ≤ 100%) and the R2 adjusted for the number of terms in the model (adjusted R2). Furthermore, the model predictive ability was quantified from predicted R2 obtained as the R2 evaluated from residuals of observations not considered in the construction of the model (i.e., each observation was removed from the dataset, the regression model was estimated and the corresponding residual was evaluated). Note that predicted R2 is expected to be always lower than R2, and that a value markedly lower than R2 suggests model overfitting to the data. Finally, the variance of the data was decomposed into the contribution of the model terms (discriminating between the contribution of linear, quadratic and 2-way interaction terms, which sums up to R2) and error terms (distinguishing lack of fit and pure error). The lack of fit of the models was also investigated as experimental data contained replicate measures, where differences between replicate measures are assumed to represent pure error in the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with Minitab v17 (PA, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Office System, USA), considering a statistical significance of p = 0.05. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Regression modeling The A 0 (mean ± standard deviation) of MTG at the different pH levels (4, 5, 6, and 7) was 2.07 × 10−3 ± 4.68 × 10−5, 5.16 × 10−3 ± 6.81 × 10−5, 5.62 × 10−3 ± 2.89 × 10−5, and 4.87 × 10−3 ± 9.21 × 10−5 OD·min−1·mL−1, respectively. These results agree with the information already published on the optimum pH of MTG (Ando et al. 1989), where A 0 is higher at pH 6, presenting a lower activity at lower pH values. It is noteworthy to mention MTG's ability to maintain activity at pH 4. Values obtained for the relative residual enzyme activity (A r ) (Eq. 1) under the different HPP processing conditions and pH values are shown in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1 . It is quite clear from Fig. 1A that the average A r values decrease with increasing pressure values, for all pH levels. Furthermore, average A r values are higher for higher pH levels, for all pressure values, except for pH 4 and pressure 600 MPa. With respect to the remaining variables (Fig. 1B and C), the A r tendency to decrease for increasing temperature or holding time is less evident than that observed for pressure. Overall, Fig. 1 suggests that the variation of the A r values are more associated with pH and pressure variations rather than with temperature and holding time variations. The model described in Eq. 2 was fitted to these experimental data at the four pH values under study. The estimates of the models coefficients are presented in Table 2 . Constant and linear terms on pressure, temperature, and holding time are statistically significant for all pH models (p < 0.05). With respect to quadratic terms, pressure is significant for all models whereas temperature is only significant for pH 4 and holding time is significant for pH 5. Models with pH 6 and 7 excluded quadratic temperature and holding time terms. Finally, 2-way interaction terms are significant in the models except for pH 5 for which all interaction terms were not considered. The negative coefficients on each term reported in Table 2 indicate that all linear, quadratic and interaction terms favor the inactivation since the increase of any of these parameters results in a lower A r . The only exception is observed at pH 4, where the existing quadratic and interaction terms exhibit a positive coefficient. On the overall assessment of the models, Table 3 shows the models summary statistics. All models were statistically significant, with the ANOVA showing large values for the F statistics (F > 120 for all models) and, concordantly, low values of the corresponding p-values. Regarding the goodness of fit and predictive ability of the models, Table 3 shows that R2, adjusted R2 and predicted R2 were large for all pH levels, hence supporting that a large percentage of the variability of the data is explained by the constructed models (with values ranging from 0.93 and 0.99, in all cases). Furthermore, these statistics showed to exhibit similar values within each pH thus excluding over parametrization and overfitting of the constructed models. Finally, the significant lack of fit exhibited at all pH levels (P < 0.001) suggests that a (statistically) relevant part of the data variability is not explained by the model. It is however worth to refer that lack of fit weights <4% of the total variability to be explained by the model and exhibits similar values to that of the pure error term. Furthermore, plots of residuals vs. the predicted response showed no defined structure and the normal probability plots of residuals exhibited a straight line (some examples are shown in Fig. S1 as Supplementary Material). Thus, overall, the four models seem to be good representatives of the high-pressure inactivation of MTG at each specified pH level. Table 3 additionally presents the contribution of the data variability explained by the model terms (expressed as a %), distinguishing linear, quadratic and interaction ones. It is evident that the large contribution is due to the linear terms (with values varying between 66% and 75% for all models). Furthermore, pressure alone is the term with the largest contribution for all models, exhibiting contribution values larger than 50% for the linear components and larger than 75% when also accounting for the quadratic and the interaction terms. Thus, the pressure contribution in these models surpasses the contribution of the remaining variables, including temperature. Contrarily, Lauber et al. (2001) reported that the stability of MTG was more affected by temperature than pressure, probably related to the broader temperature range analyzed by these authors, reaching 60 °C. MTG is very stable up to 40 °C, retaining 100% of its activity for 10 min at this temperature (atmospheric pressure; pH 6) (Ando et al. 1989), thus it is not surprising that, within the temperature range analyzed in the present work, the thermal effect is reduced when compared to the pressure effect. 3.2 Effects of different factors on MTG's inactivation At all pH tested it was possible to achieve over 80% of inactivation, except for pH 7, where the maximum inactivation was around 50%. Nonetheless, MTG was relatively resistant to pressure, being necessary at least 400 MPa for 30 min to achieve an inactivation >20% when the enzyme was near its optimal pH (6–7) - Fig. 2 . Thus, MTG follows the behavior of most monomeric proteins that only denature above 400 MPa, when at ambient temperature and neutral pH (Gross & Jaenicke 1994). Concordantly, Henle and coworkers (Lauber et al. 2001; Menéndez et al. 2006) reported a similar low degree of inactivation for MTG under analogous conditions. According to the developed models, at these pH (particularly at pH 7), an apparent slight activation of MTG can be observed at 200–300 MPa. This is a common effect that has been reported for several enzymes, particularly monomeric enzymes, usually observed within low pressure range and dependent on several factors such as the type of enzyme, processing conditions (e.g. pressure level, time and temperature), and environmental conditions (e.g. pH) (Chakraborty et al. 2014; Terefe, Buckow, & Versteeg 2014). There are a couple of possible explanations for enzyme pressure activation, such as conformational changes promoted by pressure (Eisenmenger & Reyes-De-Corcuera 2009) or the dissociation of existent aggregates (Silva & Weber 1993). The temperature and pressure may have antagonistic or synergetic effects in the inactivation of enzymes, depending on the enzyme and overall conditions. Both may promote enzyme denaturation, or the thermal unfolding (associated with a positive V a ) may be counteracted by pressure (Balny & Masson 1993; Meersman et al. 2006). Pressure-temperature inactivation of enzymes typically displays elliptical contour diagrams as a function of pressure and temperature (Ludikhuyze, Van Loey, Indrawati, Smout, & Hendrickx 2003). In the present study, no major interaction effects between pressure and temperature were verified for MTG's inactivation. This may be related to the thermal stability of MTG in the temperature range studied, as previously mentioned. The major impact of temperature was verified at lower pressures, in the activation of MTG. At pH 6 the increase in activity only occurred below 30 °C, whereas at pH 7 it was verified within the whole temperature range tested, although to a lesser extent at higher temperatures – Fig. 3 . As previously stated, the A 0 of MTG at pH 4 was considerably lower than at the others pH. The pH influences the stability of enzymes mainly because of the pK a values of the different ionizable groups that cause different local electrostatic effects and consequently affect the intramolecular interactions. It is worth to mention that the studied pH range is bellow MTG's isoelectric point (c.a. 9), therefore, at these pH values the enzyme's charge is positive, showing a higher density with a decrease in pH. The active site of MTG contains many residues with negatively charged side chains, namely four aspartic acid and two glutamic acid residues (Kashiwagi, & Yokoyama, K. -I., Ishikawa, K., Ono, K., Ejima, D., Matsui, H., & Suzuki, E. -I. 2002). Both residues have a side chain pK a of around 4, which means that at this pH a high number of these residues begins to protonate rendering a less active enzyme. In fact, a higher inactivation occurred at the lower pH, i.e. 4 and 5,with 50% of inactivation after approximately 15 min at 200 MPa (pH 4) and 20 min at 450 MPa (pH 5) (Fig. 2), suggesting that pressure inactivates MTG more easily at low pH, which has already been verified for other enzymes, such as pectin methylesterase, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase (Kaushik, Nadella, & Rao 2015), and amylase (Riahi & Ramaswamy 2004). The increase of pressure usually induces the dissociation of weak acids, resulting in electrostriction that, together with a higher amount of ion pairs, result in further electrostatic effects around the enzyme. The increased exposure of hydrophobic groups and their hydration induced by pressure, associated with these electrostatic effects, may consequently induce higher conformational changes and loss of enzyme activity (Gross & Jaenicke 1994). 3.3 Estimated inactivation kinetics Inactivation kinetics strongly depends on the experimental conditions (e.g. type of buffer, pH, enzyme concentration, etc.), as well the accurateness of the projected parameters. For all the obtained models, MTG inactivation followed first-order kinetics. An example of the obtained MTG's inactivation kinetics, at 500 MPa and pH 6, can be seen in Fig. 4 . In a general way, k increased with increasing pressure and temperature within the pH range from 5 to 7 (Fig. 5 ). The studies performed by Lauber et al. (2001) and Menéndez et al. (2006), at pH 6, are in line with our findings. For example, at 40 °C and 600 MPa, we estimated an inactivation rate of 0.034 min−1, Lauber and co-workers 0.023 min−1, and Menéndez and co-workers 0.047 min−1. On the other hand, at pH 4, k decreased with increasing pressure but increased with increasing temperature. These results suggest that, particularly at this pH, pressure and temperature do not work synergistically, most likely because temperature affects mainly heat labile interactions, such as hydrogen bonds (not much affected by pressure), while pressure affects mainly electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (not as sensitive to temperature) (Ledward 2000). It seems that at a more acidic pH, the increase of pressure leads to effects that counteract the effects of pH, probably because high pressure promotes ionization of the acidic groups, whereas the decrease of pH promotes their protonation. Worth to mention that k was generally higher at pH 5 and 7, indicating a faster pressure inactivation at these pH values. Table 4 shows the estimated E a for different pressure values at the different pH. At the lower pH values (i.e. 4 and 5), no significant changes with pressure were observed, at each pH, except for 600 MPa at pH 5 where the E a increased considerably, suggesting a higher temperature sensitivity of k at this pressure. On the contrary, at pH 6 and 7 there was a tendency for E a to decrease with increasing pressure, suggesting a lower temperature sensitivity at higher pressures. The temperature dependence at 200 and 300 MPa, at pH 6 and 7, and at 600 MPa at pH 4, could not be described by the Arrhenius equation. Comparing the estimated E a by our model with the values reported by Lauber et al. (2001) under analogous conditions, i.e. 400 MPa at pH 6, both values were relatively close, namely 51.4 and 43.8 kJ mol−1, respectively. Moreover, a similar decrease of Ea (c.a. 7 kJ mol−1) with increasing pressure from 400 to 600 MPa was also verified, in accordance with the previous study of Lauber and co-workers. It is worth to recall that, in agreement with the Le Chatelier's principle, a V a  < 0 favors the pressure denaturation of proteins and subsequent inactivation (in the particular case of enzymes), whereas V a  > 0 favors their stability. The Eyring equation was valid within the entire temperature range (Table 5 ). A positive V a was found at pH 4, not being much influenced by the temperature, which means that increasing pressure retarded the inactivation of MTG, as expected due to the consistent decrease of the k with increasing pressure (Fig. 4), as previously discussed. Negative V a values were obtained for the other pH values. At pH 5, V a was not influenced by temperature. Considering pH 6 and 7, a decreasing V a was obtained with increasing temperature. Although Lauber et al. (2001) did not identify a trend in the V a with increasing pressure in the inactivation of MTG, this trend was identified for other enzymes (Ludikhuyze, Indrawati, Van den Broeck, Weemaes, & Hendrickx 1998). It is well described in the literature that the temperature and pressure may have antagonistic effects in the denaturation of proteins, depending on the protein and overall conditions. The main reason is that thermal unfolding is associated with a positive V a that is countered by pressure (Balny & Masson 1993; Meersman et al. 2006). There are no studies of high-pressure inactivation of MTG at different pH, still, at similar conditions (40 °C and pH 6), Lauber et al. (2001) and Menéndez et al. (2006) reported activation volumes of −17.4 and − 10.1 cm3 mol−1, respectively, that are comparable to our estimation, −26.6 cm3 mol−1. It is important to keep in mind that these studies used a different buffer and pressurization/depressurization rates, which may have influenced the inactivation kinetics. The obtained results indicate that MTG is very stable under pressure, at least when near its optimal pH (5–7) and temperatures below 40 °C. 4 Conclusions Combining MTG treatments and HPP may be an interesting tool to tailor food proteins and develop new products and applications. Still, it is necessary to gather knowledge regarding the behavior not only of the target proteins under pressure but also of the MTG. In our study, we verified that low pH enhances the pressure inactivation of MTG and that higher pressure (>400 MPa) is required to achieve enzyme's inactivation near its optimal pH. The increase of both pressure and temperature increased k at pH 5, 6 and 7, while the opposite was found at pH 4. It was possible to observe that at pH 4 and 5, pressure and temperature did not significantly affect E a and V a , respectively. Nonetheless, an antagonistic effect of pressure and temperature on MTG inactivation is suggested to occur at pH 6 and 7, associated to the decrease of E a and V a with increasing pressure and temperature, respectively. Considering all kinetic parameters obtained in this study, and also those available in literature, it can be concluded that the developed models (at least at pH 6) accurately describe the high-pressure inactivation of MTG. Still, further research is necessary to better understand the effects of pressure on the inactivation of MTG under alkaline pH, and how the observed effects are influenced by other food components, having in mind the real food matrices where the combined effects or HPP and MTG may have important applications.

In this note, we introduce a discrete counterpart of the conventional max-autoregressive moving-average process of Davis and Resnick (1989), based on the binomial thinning operator and driven by a sequence of i. i. d. nonnegative integer-valued random variables with a finite range of counts. Basic probabilistic and statistical properties of this new class of models are discussed in detail, namely the existence of a stationary distribution, and how observations’ and innovations’ distributions are related to each other. Furthermore, parameter estimation is also addressed. Keywords Thinning operator Autoregressive moving-average processes Finite counts 1 Introduction Modeling the temporal dependence of integer-valued time series defined on a finite range of counts, say { 0 , 1 , … , n } , is nowadays a topic of research which is gaining importance in time series analysis. Note that traditional integer-valued ARMA-type models are useless in this context, since such models are defined over unbounded sets. To tackle this limitation, McKenzie (1985) introduced the binomial AR(1) model based on the so-called binomial thinning operator (Steutel and van Harn, 1979), in which X t takes the form (1.1) X t = α ∘ X t − 1 + β ∘ ( n − X t − 1 ) , where the binomial thinning operator “ ϕ ∘ ” is defined as follows: if X is a discrete random variable with range N 0 and if ϕ ∈ ( 0 ; 1 ) , then the random variable ϕ ∘ X is defined by the conditional binomial distribution Bin ( X , ϕ ) , given the value of X ; the boundary values ϕ = 0 and ϕ = 1 are included by setting 0 ∘ X ≔ 0 and 1 ∘ X ≔ X . Note that by construction, X t preserves the boundedness of the range. The binomial AR(1) model was extended to a p th-order AR-like model by Weiß (2009), who combined the data generating mechanism of the binomial AR(1) model with a random mixture. The approach by Weiß (2009), however, cannot be extended beyond a purely autoregressive model, and also a pure moving-average model cannot be constructed in this way. Our aim in this paper is to construct a full integer-valued time series model with finite support, in the sense that the model should include both an autoregressive-type and a moving-average-type component (therefore a “full” counterpart), and it should certainly contain both a purely autoregressive-type and a purely moving-average-type model as a special case. To this extent we introduce a discrete counterpart of the conventional max-autoregressive moving-average process of Davis and Resnick (1989) which will be referred to as the maximum BARMA (in short max-BARMA ( p , q ) ) model. The novel max-BARMA ( p , q ) model proposed in Section 2 includes both an autoregressive and a moving-average part, and a stationary solution exists under rather weak conditions. After having discussed stochastic properties and important special cases, we present an approach for parameter estimation in Section 3, and we conclude in Section 4. 2 The max-BARMA model Motivated by the max-ARMA models (Davis and Resnick, 1989), we define an integer-valued counterpart of this model for counts having the bounded support { 0 , … , n } with a fixed upper limit n ∈ N . We refer to these models as the max-BARMA ( p , q ) models (“B” like “bounded”), and they are defined by the recursion (2.1) X t = max { α 1 ∘ X t − 1 , … , α p ∘ X t − p , ϵ t , β 1 ∘ ϵ t − 1 , … , β q ∘ ϵ t − q } , where the i.i.d. innovations are assumed to have the bounded range { 0 , … , n } . Note that binomial thinning always has a non-increasing effect, i.e., α ∘ x ≤ x holds, so (2.1) preserves the boundedness of the range { 0 , … , n } . The thinnings in (2.1) are assumed to be executed each time anew: although we omit this in the sequel for the sake of readability, it would be more correct to add a time index t to the thinnings, i.e., X t = max { α 1 ∘ t X t − 1 , … , β q ∘ t ϵ t − q } . In addition, all thinnings are assumed to be executed completely independent of each other, i.e., in particular, we assume that α 1 ∘ t + 1 X t , … , α p ∘ t + p X t as well as β 1 ∘ s + 1 ϵ s , … , β q ∘ s + q ϵ s are conditionally independent, given the values of X t and ϵ s , respectively. Important special cases (to be discussed in some more detail in the later Sections 2.1 and 2.2) are the purely moving-average max-BMA(q) model (i.e., p = 0 ) defined by X t = max { ϵ t , β 1 ∘ ϵ t − 1 , … , β q ∘ ϵ t − q } , and the purely autoregressive max-BAR(p) model (i.e., q = 0 ) defined by X t = max { α 1 ∘ X t − 1 , … , α p ∘ X t − p , ϵ t } . The max-BARMA ( p , q ) process (2.1) can be represented as a ( p + q ) -dimensional homogeneous finite Markov chain, (2.2) Z t ≔ ( X t ; X t − 1 , … , X t − p + 1 , ϵ t , … , ϵ t − q + 1 ) ⊤ , which is understood to reduce to ( X t ; X t − 1 , … , X t − p + 1 ) ⊤ in the purely autoregressive case ( q = 0 ), and to ( X t ; ϵ t , … , ϵ t − q + 1 ) ⊤ in the purely moving-average case ( p = 0 ). For simplicity in notation, we define the possible outcomes z ∈ { 0 , … , n } p + q of Z t as z = ( z 1 , … , z p , z − 1 , … , z − q ) ⊤ . For the cases with q ≥ 1 , the range Z of Z t is only a subset of { 0 , … , n } p + q , since z 1 can never exceed the maximum of the remaining components, since z 1 can never fall below z − 1 , and since the ϵ ’s distribution might have probability 0 for some counts in { 0 , … , n } . For q = 0 , Z = { 0 , … , n } p , i.e., the full range is possible (provided that P ( ϵ = 0 ) , P ( ϵ = n ) > 0 ). Note that the 1-step-ahead transition probabilities p z | y ≔ P ( Z t = z | Z t − 1 = y ) are (2.3) p z | y = δ z 2 , y 1 ⋯ δ z p , y p − 1 ⋅ δ z − 2 , y − 1 ⋯ δ z − q , y − q + 1 ⋅ P ( ϵ t = z − 1 ) ⋅ P ( X t = z 1 | X t − 1 = y 1 , … , X t − p = y p , ϵ t = z − 1 , ϵ t − 1 = y − 1 , … , ϵ t − q = y − q ) , with the last factor being equal to (2.4) P ( max { α 1 ∘ y 1 , … , α p ∘ y p , z − 1 , β 1 ∘ y − 1 , … , β q ∘ y − q } = z 1 ) = F Bin ( y 1 , α 1 ) ( z 1 ) ⋯ F Bin ( y p , α p ) ( z 1 ) ⋅ 1 ( z − 1 ≤ z 1 ) ⋅ F Bin ( y − 1 , β 1 ) ( z 1 ) ⋯ F Bin ( y − q , β q ) ( z 1 ) − F Bin ( y 1 , α 1 ) ( z 1 − 1 ) ⋯ 1 ( z − 1 ≤ z 1 − 1 ) ⋯ F Bin ( y − q , β q ) ( z 1 − 1 ) , where F Bin ( n , π ) ( x ) abbreviates the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the binomial distribution Bin ( n , π ) . This factorization follows immediately from the well-known equality (2.5) P ( max { Y 1 , … , Y m } ≤ x ) = ∏ i = 1 m P ( Y i ≤ x ) , for independent random variables Y 1 , … , Y m . The Markov-chain representation (2.2) and (2.3) is used to prove the existence of the max-BARMA ( p , q ) process. The main result of this section is given below. Theorem 2.1 If all thinning probabilities satisfy α 1 , … , β q ∈ ( 0 ; 1 ) , and if the innovations satisfy P ( ϵ = k ) > 0 for all k ∈ { 0 , … , n } , then the max-BARMA ( p , q ) process (2.1) is ergodic with a unique stationary solution, which is also ϕ -mixing with geometrically decreasing weights. For p = 0 or q = 0 , it suffices to require that P ( ϵ = 0 ) , P ( ϵ = n ) > 0 . Proof The proof starts by showing that the ( p + q + 1 ) -step-ahead transition probabilities equal p z | y ( p + q + 1 ) of the Markov chain ( Z t ) Z are truly positive, thus implying that ( Z t ) Z constitutes a primitive finite Markov chain. Case q = 0 : For Z t = ( X t , … , X t − p + 1 ) ⊤ , the ( p + 1 ) -step-ahead transition probabilities equal p z | y ( p + 1 ) = P ( X t = z 1 , … , X t − p + 1 = z p | X t − p − 1 = y 1 , … , X t − 2 p = y p ) = ∑ z p + 1 P ( X t = z 1 , … , X t − p + 1 = z p , X t − p = z p + 1 | X t − p − 1 = y 1 , … , X t − 2 p = y p ) = ∑ z p + 1 P ( z 1 ∣ z 2 , … , z p + 1 ) ⋯ P ( z p | z p + 1 , y 1 , … , y p − 1 ) ⋅ P ( z p + 1 | y 1 , … , y p ) , which is truly positive if one of the summands is truly positive, i.e., if one of the summands consists of only truly positive factors. This happens at least for the summand z p + 1 = n : • If one of the past observations x 1 , … , x p is equal to n , say x i = n , then we have P ( x 0 ∣ x 1 , … , x p ) > 0 , because α i ∘ n has the full support { 0 , … , n } since all α 1 , … , α p ∈ ( 0 ; 1 ) , and because P ( ϵ = 0 ) > 0 is assumed. • Conditional probabilities of the form P ( n ∣ x 1 , … , x p ) are truly positive, since P ( ϵ = n ) > 0 is assumed. Case p = 0 : For Z t = ( X t ; ϵ t , … , ϵ t − q + 1 ) ⊤ , the ( q + 1 ) -step-ahead transition probabilities equals, with the same arguments as before, p z | y ( q + 1 ) = P ( X t = z 1 , ϵ t = z − 1 , … , ϵ t − q + 1 = z − q | X t − q − 1 = y 1 , ϵ t − q − 1 = y − 1 , … , ϵ t − 2 q = y − q ) = ∑ z 2 , … , z q + 1 , z − q − 1 P ( ϵ t − q = z − q − 1 ) ∏ j = 0 q − 1 P ( ϵ t − j = z − j − 1 ) ⋅ P ( X t = z 1 | ϵ t = z − 1 , … , ϵ t − q = z − q − 1 ) ⋅ ∏ i = 1 q P ( X t − i = z i + 1 | ϵ t − i = z − i − 1 , … , ϵ t − i − q = y − i ) . In analogy to the case q = 0 , if P ( ϵ = n ) > 0 and if β 1 , … , β q ∈ ( 0 ; 1 ) , then every summand with z q + 1 = z − q − 1 = n and z i + 1 = z − i − 1 for i = 1 , … , q − 1 is truly positive. Note that z ∈ Z excludes “impossible states” such as z 1 < z − 1 . Case p , q ≥ 1 : Analogous arguments as before are applied to the ( p + q + 1 ) -step-ahead transition probabilities: p z | y ( p + q + 1 ) = P ( X t = z 1 , … , X t − p + 1 = z p , ϵ t = z − 1 , … , ϵ t − q + 1 = z − q | X t − p − q − 1 = y 1 , … , X t − q − 2 p = y p , ϵ t − p − q − 1 = y − 1 , … , ϵ t − p − 2 q = y − q ) = ∑ z p + 1 , … , z p + q + 1 , z − q − 1 , … , z − p − q − 1 ∏ j = 0 q − 1 P ( ϵ t − j = z − j − 1 ) ∏ j = q q + p P ( ϵ t − j = z − j − 1 ) ⋅ ∏ i = 0 p + q P ( X t − i = z i + 1 | X t − i − 1 = z i + 2 , … , X t − i − p = y i − q , ϵ t − i = z − i − 1 , … , ϵ t − i − q = y − i ) . Here, we focus on summands with z i + 1 = z − i − 1 for i = p , … , p + q and with z − i − 1 = z i + 1 for i = q , … , p + q ; if both z i + 1 and z − i − 1 can be selected, we consider the summands with z i + 1 = ⋯ = z − i − 1 = n . Now we follow the proof in Section 2.2 of Weiß (2013) step-by-step to obtain that ( Z t ) Z is a primitive finite Markov chain, which, in turn, leads to ( X t ) Z being stationary, ergodic and ϕ -mixing with geometrically decreasing weights. # 2.1 The max-BMA(q) models The purely moving-average max-BMA(q) model, (2.6) X t = max { ϵ t , β 1 ∘ ϵ t − 1 , … , β q ∘ ϵ t − q } , constitutes a q-dependent model for bounded counts, i.e., X t and X t − k are independent of each other for lag k > q . In particular, this implies that also the autocorrelation function (ACF) satisfies ρ ( k ) = 0 for k > q . Furthermore, since the innovations ( ϵ t ) are i.i.d., and since thinnings are executed independently, the components ϵ t , β 1 ∘ ϵ t − 1 , … , β q ∘ ϵ t − q within the max-operator are independent. Therefore, the marginal cdf satisfies (2.7) F X ( x ) = F ϵ ( x ) ∏ i = 1 q F β i ∘ ϵ ( x ) , where the factorization follows again from the equality (2.5). Using the closed-form formula (2.7), further marginal properties are easily computed, e. g., the marginal mean as E [ X ] = ∑ x = 0 n − 1 ( 1 − F ( x ) ) , or the probability mass function (pmf) p X ( x ) ≔ P ( X = x ) by differencing. Example 2.2 Binomial Innovations Let the innovations be binomially distributed, ϵ ∼ Bin ( n , π ) , then β ∘ ϵ ∼ Bin ( n , π β ) . So the marginal distribution according to (2.7) equals F X ( x ) = F Bin ( n , π β 1 ) ( x ) ⋯ F Bin ( n , π β q ) ( x ) ⋅ F Bin ( n , π ) ( x ) , which is a product of binomial cdfs. Here, F Bin ( n , π ) ( x ) = ∑ m = 0 x n m π m ( 1 − π ) n − m . In particular, the zero probability p X ( 0 ) = F X ( 0 ) becomes p X ( 0 ) = ( 1 − π β 1 ) n ⋯ ( 1 − π β q ) n ⋅ ( 1 − π ) n . Example 2.3 Uniform Innovations If the marginal distribution of a max-BMA(q) process with uniform innovations, i.e., with pmf P ( ϵ = l ) = 1 n + 1 , has to be computed according to (2.7), then the distribution of β ∘ ϵ is required. We compute F β ∘ ϵ ( x ) = ∑ l = 0 n P ( β ∘ l ≤ x ) P ( ϵ = l ) = 1 n + 1 ∑ l = 0 n F Bin ( l , β ) ( x ) , which is the mean of the binomial cdfs F Bin ( 0 , β ) ( x ) , … , F Bin ( n , β ) ( x ) . In particular, since F β ∘ ϵ ( 0 ) = 1 n + 1 ∑ l = 0 n ( 1 − β ) l = 1 n + 1 1 − ( 1 − β ) n + 1 β , the zero probability becomes p X ( 0 ) = 1 ( n + 1 ) q + 1 ∏ j = 1 q 1 − ( 1 − β j ) n + 1 β j . Example 2.4 Two-Point Innovations Next, we consider a max-BMA(q) process with innovations stemming from a two-point distribution on { 0 , … , n } , i.e., with P ( ϵ t = n ) = π = 1 − P ( ϵ t = 0 ) . If the marginal distribution has to be computed according to (2.7), then the distribution of β ∘ ϵ is required. We compute F β ∘ ϵ ( x ) = ∑ k = 0 x ∑ l = 0 n P ( β ∘ l = k ) P ( ϵ = l ) = ( 1 − π ) + π F β ∘ n ( x ) , which is the zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) distribution ZIB ( n , β , 1 − π ) . So (2.7) leads to F X ( x ) = ( 1 − π ) ( 1 − π + π F Bin ( n , β 1 ) ( x ) ) ⋯ ( 1 − π + π F Bin ( n , β q ) ( x ) ) for all x < n ; certainly, F X ( n ) = 1 . The zero probability becomes p X ( 0 ) = ( 1 − π ) ( 1 − π + π ( 1 − β 1 ) n ) ⋯ ( 1 − π + π ( 1 − β q ) n ) . 2.2 The max-BAR(p) models The purely autoregressive max-BAR(p) model, defined by (2.8) X t = max { α 1 ∘ X t − 1 , … , α p ∘ X t − p , ϵ t } , is a p-order Markov model. Its conditional cdf is computed (2.9) F X t | x t − 1 , … , x t − p ( x ) = F Bin ( x t − 1 , α 1 ) ( x ) ⋯ F Bin ( x t − p , α p ) ( x ) ⋅ F ϵ ( x ) , utilizing again the general equality (2.5). In particular, the conditional zero probability equals P ( X t = 0 | x t − 1 , … , x t − p ) = p ϵ ( 0 ) ∏ i = 1 p ( 1 − α i ) x t − i . The most simple instance of the max-BAR(p) model is the max-BAR(1) model (with autoregressive parameter α 1 = α ) defined by (2.10) X t = max { α ∘ X t − 1 , ϵ t } , which constitutes a Markov chain and serves as an alternative to the binomial AR(1) model (1.1). Its transition probabilities are computed from its conditional cdf (2.11) F X t | X t − 1 = l ( k ) = F ϵ ( k ) ∑ m = 0 min { k , l } l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m , see (2.9). Conditional factorial moments are computed as (2.12) E [ ( X t ) ( r ) | X t − 1 = l ] = E [ max { α ∘ X t − 1 , ϵ t } ( r ) | X t − 1 = l ] = ∑ m = 0 l l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m E [ max { m , ϵ t } ( r ) ] , where E [ max { m , ϵ t } ( r ) ] = m ( r ) P ( ϵ t ≤ m ) + ∑ k > m k ( r ) P ( ϵ t = k ) = m ( r ) F ϵ ( m ) + μ ϵ , ( r ) − ∑ k ≤ m k ( r ) P ( ϵ t = k ) . Example 2.5 Uniform Innovations Let the ϵ t be uniformly distributed on { 0 , … , n } , i.e., with cdf F ϵ ( k ) = k + 1 n + 1 . The conditional mean follows from (2.11) as E [ X t | X t − 1 = l ] = ∑ k = 0 n ( 1 − F X t | X t − 1 = l ( k ) ) = n + 1 − ∑ k = 0 n k + 1 n + 1 ∑ m = 0 k l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m = n + 1 − ∑ m = 0 n l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m ∑ k = m n k + 1 n + 1 = n + 1 − ∑ m = 0 l l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m 1 n + 1 ( ( n + 1 ) ( n + 2 ) 2 − m ( m + 1 ) 2 ) = n + 1 − n + 2 2 + 1 2 ( n + 1 ) ∑ m = 0 l l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m ( m ( m − 1 ) + 2 m ) = α 2 2 ( n + 1 ) l 2 + α ( 2 − α ) 2 ( n + 1 ) l + n 2 , where in the second last step, we used the formula for the factorial moments of the binomial distribution. So the conditional mean is a quadratic function in the previous observation. Alternatively, we might have used (2.12) to derive this formula, or to derive expressions for higher-order factorial moments. Example 2.6 Two-Point Innovations Let ϵ t follow a two-point distribution on { 0 , … , n } with P ( ϵ t = n ) = π = 1 − P ( ϵ t = 0 ) . By the definition of the Max-BAR(1) model, the generated sample paths will show a saw-tooth-type pattern: at each time when ϵ = n , a shock is generated and shifts X to the value n , while afterwards, during the period until the next shock (when ϵ = 0 ), the thinning α ∘ X causes the observations to decay monotonically. For the two-point distribution, we obtain F ϵ ( k ) = 1 − π + δ k , n π , μ ϵ , ( r ) ≔ E [ ( ϵ t ) ( r ) ] = n ( r ) π , ∑ k = 0 m k ( r ) P ( ϵ t = k ) = δ m , n n ( r ) π . So altogether, see the Appendix for detailed derivations, E [ max { m , ϵ t } ( r ) ] = m ( r ) ( 1 − π ) + n ( r ) π . Hence, using (2.12) together with the formula for the binomial factorial moments, E [ ( X t ) ( r ) | X t − 1 = l ] = α r ( 1 − π ) l ( r ) + n ( r ) π , which is an r th-order polynomial in the last observation with leading coefficient α r ( 1 − π ) . In particular, the conditional mean E [ X t | X t − 1 ] = α ( 1 − π ) X t − 1 + n π , is linear in the previous observation, so a max-BAR(1) model with two-point innovations is a CLAR(1) model (Grunwald et al., 2000). As a result, we obtain the marginal mean as μ ≔ E [ X ] = n π 1 − α ( 1 − π ) . Similarly, the conditional variance V [ X t | X t − 1 ] = X t − 1 2 α 2 π ( 1 − π ) − X t − 1 α ( 1 − π ) ( 2 n π − 1 + α ) + n 2 π ( 1 − π ) , is a quadratic polynomial in the last observation. So σ 2 ≔ V [ X t ] = α 2 π ( 1 − π ) μ 2 − α ( 1 − π ) ( 2 n π + α ) μ + n 2 π ( 1 − π ) 1 − α 2 π ( 1 − π ) . The transition probabilities p k | l implied by (2.11) take a very simple form. For k = 0 , … , n − 1 , we have F X t | X t − 1 = l ( k ) = ( 1 − π ) ∑ m = 0 k l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m , so by differencing, we obtain p k | l = ( 1 − π ) l k α k ( 1 − α ) l − k , which equals 0 for k > l . Altogether, we obtain p k | l = δ k , n π + ( 1 − π ) P ( α ∘ l = k ) , where P ( α ∘ l = k ) = 0 if l < k , i.e., the transition matrix exhibits a triangular-type structure. So far, we specified the max-BAR(1) model by specifying its innovations’ distribution. In applications, one sometimes prefers to specify the observations’ marginal distribution instead and to derive the corresponding distribution of the innovations. The marginal cdfs of the observations and innovations of a stationary max-BAR(1) process are related to each other by the equation (2.13) F X ( x ) = F α ∘ X ( x ) ⋅ F ϵ ( x ) . According to Theorem 1.A.4 in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), α ∘ X ≤ st X , i.e., we always have that F X ( x ) ≤ F α ∘ X ( x ) . Thus, the quotient F X ∕ F α ∘ X always satisfies 0 ≤ F X ( x ) ∕ F α ∘ X ( x ) ≤ 1 for all x . So the cdf F X ( x ) is a valid cdf for a max-BAR(1) model iff F X ∕ F α ∘ X is monotonically increasing (and this would then be the cdf of the innovations), which is equivalent to requiring that (2.14) p X ( x + 1 ) p α ∘ X ( x + 1 ) ≥ F X ( x ) F α ∘ X ( x ) for all x = 0 , … , n − 1 , where p ⋅ ( ⋅ ) denotes the respective pmf. Obviously, a sufficient condition for (2.14) is (2.15) p X ( x + 1 ) p α ∘ X ( x + 1 ) ≥ p X ( j ) p α ∘ X ( j ) for all j ≤ x . The subsequent example demonstrates the application of condition (2.15) to prove that the binomial distribution is a possible marginal distribution of a max-BAR(1) process. Example 2.7 Binomial Observations Let X ∼ Bin ( n , π ) , then α ∘ X ∼ Bin ( n , π α ) . Therefore, p X ( x + 1 ) p α ∘ X ( x + 1 ) p α ∘ X ( j ) = ( 1 − π α ) x + 1 − j α x + 1 − j ( 1 − π ) x + 1 − j n j π j ( 1 − π ) n − j = ( 1 − π α α − π α ) x + 1 − j p X ( j ) > p X ( j ) , for all j ≤ x , so condition (2.15) is satisfied. So any binomial distribution is a possible marginal distribution of a max-BAR(1) process. The innovations’ cdf follows from (2.13) as F ϵ ( k ) = F Bin ( n , π ) ( k ) ∕ F Bin ( n , π α ) ( k ) , in particular, we have p ϵ ( 0 ) = ( 1 − π ) n ( 1 − π α ) n and μ ϵ = ∑ k = 0 n − 1 ( 1 − F ϵ ( k ) ) = n − ∑ k = 0 n − 1 F Bin ( n , π ) ( k ) F Bin ( n , π α ) ( k ) . An example of a bounded distribution, which cannot be used as a marginal for a max-BAR(1) process, is the two-point distribution. Example 2.8 Two-Point Distribution Let us assume that B ∼ Bin ( 1 , π ) is a Bernoulli random variable, and define X ≔ n ⋅ B . For π = 0 or π = 1 , this implies X to be constant, either constantly equal to 0 or to n , respectively. In the first case, it follows that also α ∘ X and ϵ are constantly 0. In the second case, α ∘ X is just binomially distributed according to Bin ( n , α ) such that F X ( x ) F α ∘ X ( x ) = 1 { x ≥ n } ( x ) F Bin ( n , α ) ( x ) = 1 { x ≥ n } ( x ) . So again condition (2.14) is satisfied with ϵ being constantly n . Now, let us look at the case π ∈ ( 0 ; 1 ) , where X follows a non-degenerate two-point distribution on { 0 , n } . If n > 1 , α ∘ X follows the zero-inflated binomial distribution with p.g.f. pgf α ∘ X ( s ) = 1 − π + π ( 1 − α + α s ) n , and we have p X ( 1 ) p α ∘ X ( 1 ) = 0 p α ∘ X ( 1 ) < 1 − π 1 − π + π ( 1 − α ) n = F X ( 0 ) F α ∘ X ( 0 ) , thus violating (2.14). So a non-degenerate two-point distribution cannot be the marginal distribution of a max-BAR(1) model. In fact, remembering the data generating mechanism (2.10), if P ( ϵ = n ) > 0 and P ( ϵ < n ) > 0 for some n ∈ N , then the thinning α ∘ X t − 1 implies that P ( X = k ) > 0 for any k ≤ n (“no gaps in the range of X ”). 3 Parameter estimation Conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation, given the time series x 1 , … , x T , can be implemented in analogy to the approach for Hidden-Markov models as described in Chapter 3 of Zucchini and MacDonald (2009). The idea is to compute the conditional likelihood function L ( θ ) ≔ P ( x T , … , x p + 1 | x p , … , x 1 , θ ) ≔ P ( X T = x T , … , X p + 1 = x p + 1 | X p = x p , … , X 1 = x 1 , θ ) for the max-BARMA ( p , q ) model with parameters θ = ( α 1 , … , β q , θ ϵ ) ⊤ in a recursive way, where θ ϵ abbreviates the parameters of the ϵ t ’s distribution, and to maximize it numerically by using a routine for constrained optimization. To describe this recursive scheme, let us introduce some notations: • ϵ t ≔ ( ϵ t , … , ϵ t − q ) ⊤ with range E ≔ { 0 , … , n } q + 1 having the cardinality d ≔ | E | = ( n + 1 ) q + 1 . • The elements of E are arranged in a certain lexicographic ordering: E = { e 1 , … , e d } . • The vector-valued process ( ϵ t ) constitutes a homogeneous Markov chain with sparse transition matrix A = ( a i | j ) given by a i | j ≔ P ( ϵ t = e i | ϵ t − 1 = e j ) = δ e i , 1 , e j , 0 ⋯ δ e i , q , e j , q − 1 ⋅ P ( ϵ = e i , 0 ) . Note that A only depends on θ ϵ . • For all x ≤ max { x 1 , … , x T } , it will be necessary to compute the d -cumulative probabilities c i ( x ) = 1 ( e i , 0 ≤ x ) ∏ j = 1 q F Bin ( e i , j , β j ) ( x ) , i = 1 , … , d . Note that c i ( x ) only depends on the parameters β 1 , … , β q . To compute the conditional likelihood function L ( θ ) recursively, we consider the probabilities (as functions of θ ) γ t , i ≔ P ( ϵ t = e i , x t , … , x p + 1 | x p , … , x 1 ) , t ≥ p + 1 , i = 1 , … , d , since L ( θ ) = ∑ i = 1 d γ T , i . Further, note that γ t + 1 , i can be factorized as follows: γ t + 1 , i = P ( x t + 1 | ϵ t + 1 = e i , x t , … , x t − p + 1 ) ⋅ P ( ϵ t + 1 = e i , x t , … , x p + 1 | x p , … , x 1 ) , where the latter factor is computed as P ( ϵ t + 1 = e i , x t , … , x p + 1 | x p , … , x 1 ) = ∑ e j ∈ E P ( ϵ t + 1 = e i , ϵ t = e j , x t , … , x p + 1 | x p , … , x 1 ) = ∑ e j ∈ E a i | j ⋅ γ t , j . The first factor of γ t + 1 , i , in turn, is computed from the parameters α 1 , … , β q via (2.4), i.e., P ( x t + 1 | ϵ t + 1 = e i , x t , … , x t − p + 1 ) = F Bin ( x t , α 1 ) ( x t + 1 ) ⋯ F Bin ( x t − p + 1 , α p ) ( x t + 1 ) ⋅ c i ( x t + 1 ) − F Bin ( x t , α 1 ) ( x t + 1 − 1 ) ⋯ F Bin ( x t − p + 1 , α p ) ( x t + 1 − 1 ) ⋅ c i ( x t + 1 − 1 ) . Overall, we update the vector γ t = ( γ t , 1 , … , γ t , d ) ⊤ to γ t + 1 as follows: γ t + 1 = diag ( ( P ( x t + 1 | ϵ t + 1 = e i , x t , … , x t − p + 1 ) ) i = 1 , … , d ) A γ t . The procedure is initialized by γ p + 1 , i = P ( ϵ p + 1 = e i , x p + 1 | x p , … , x 1 ) = P ( x p + 1 | ϵ p + 1 = e i , x p , … , x 1 ) ⋅ P ( ϵ p + 1 = e i | x p , … , x 1 ) ≈ P ( x p + 1 | ϵ p + 1 = e i , x p , … , x 1 ) ⋅ P ( ϵ p + 1 = e i ) for i = 1 , … , d . Note that the scheme leads to the exact full likelihood for p = 0 (i.e., for a max-BMA ( q ) model). In the purely autoregressive max-BAR ( p ) case ( q = 0 ), it essentially simplifies to the usual way of computing the conditional likelihood function of a Markov model, see (2.9): L ( θ ) = ∏ t = p + 1 T P ( X t = x t | X t − 1 = x t − 1 , … , X t − p = x t − p ) = ∏ t = p + 1 T ( F Bin ( x t − 1 , α 1 ) ( x t ) ⋯ F Bin ( x t − p , α p ) ( x t ) ⋅ F ϵ ( x t ) − F Bin ( x t − 1 , α 1 ) ( x t − 1 ) ⋯ F Bin ( x t − p , α p ) ( x t − 1 ) ⋅ F ϵ ( x t − 1 ) ) . 4 Conclusions We proposed the max-BARMA ( p , q ) model as an integer-valued counterpart to the conventional max-ARMA ( p , q ) models, applicable to time series of bounded counts. This model includes both an autoregressive and a moving-average part. Basic probabilistic and statistical properties of this new class of models were discussed, namely the existence of a stationary distribution, and how observations’ and innovations’ distributions are related to each other. We also presented an approach for parameter estimation.

Appendix Proof of Example 2.6 From F ϵ ( k ) = 1 − π + δ k , n π , μ ϵ , ( r ) ≔ E [ ( ϵ t ) ( r ) ] = n ( r ) π , ∑ k = 0 m k ( r ) P ( ϵ t = k ) = δ m , n n ( r ) π , we obtain E [ max { m , ϵ t } ( r ) ] = m ( r ) F ϵ ( m ) + μ ϵ , ( r ) − ∑ k = 0 m k ( r ) P ( ϵ t = k ) = m ( r ) ( 1 − π + δ m , n π ) + ( 1 − δ m , n ) n ( r ) π = m ( r ) ( 1 − π ) + n ( r ) π − δ m , n ( n ( r ) − m ( r ) ) π = m ( r ) ( 1 − π ) + n ( r ) π . Hence, using (2.12) together with the formula for the binomial factorial moments, E [ ( X t ) ( r ) | X t − 1 = l ] = ∑ m = 0 l l m α m ( 1 − α ) l − m ⋅ ( m ( r ) ( 1 − π ) + n ( r ) π ) = l ( r ) α r ( 1 − π ) + n ( r ) π . The conditional variance becomes V [ X t | X t − 1 ] = E [ ( X t ) ( 2 ) | X t − 1 ] + E [ X t | X t − 1 ] − E 2 [ X t | X t − 1 ] = ( X t − 1 ) ( 2 ) α 2 ( 1 − π ) + n ( 2 ) π + X t − 1 α ( 1 − π ) + n π − ( X t − 1 α ( 1 − π ) + n π ) 2 = X t − 1 2 α 2 π ( 1 − π ) − X t − 1 α ( 1 − π ) ( 2 n π − 1 + α ) + n 2 π ( 1 − π ) . So σ 2 ≔ V [ X t ] = E [ V [ X t | X t − 1 ] ] + V [ E [ X t | X t − 1 ] ] = α 2 π ( 1 − π ) ( σ 2 + μ 2 ) − α ( 1 − π ) ( 2 n π + α ) μ + n 2 π ( 1 − π ) , which leads to the formula given in Example 2.6.

It is based on the so-called binomial thinning operator and driven by a sequence of independent and identically distributed nonnegative integer-valued random variables with either regularly varying right tail or exponential-type right tail. Basic probabilistic and statistical properties of the process are discussed in detail, including the analysis of conditional moments, transition probabilities, the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution, and the relationship between the observations’ and innovations’ distribution. We also provide conditions on the marginal distribution of the process to ensure that the innovations’ distribution exists and is well defined. Several examples of families of distributions satisfying such conditions are presented, but also some counterexamples are analyzed. Furthermore, the analysis of its extremal behavior is also considered. In particular, we look at the limiting distribution of sample maxima and its corresponding extremal index.",

We abbreviate this model as bvARMA, as it is based upon a novel operation referred to as binomial variation. After having discussed important stochastic properties and proposed a model-fitting approach relying on maximum likelihood estimation, we apply the bvARMA model family to the rainy-days time series.

The levoglucosan and PM10 concentration values, together with the meteorological conditions (namely temperature), measured during an experimental field campaign performed in 2013, were used in this study. To this end, a wavelet-based approach is applied to (a) better quantify the coherence and dependency of these variables and (b) assess the strength of the connection between the two pollutants species (PM and levoglucosan) at different time scales. Results evidenced a high coherence/dependency between PM10 and levoglucosan values for the episodes selected (periods with exceedances of the PM10 limit values), suggesting the contribution of biomass combustion sources. The highest coherence (normalised covariance) is observed for the winter episodes and time periods of 5–10 days, which is related to the duration of the episodes selected. The summertime episode, which exhibits a negligible observed correlation between temperature and levoglucosan, is explained by the influence of forest fires that occurred within this period and region.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2016 Royal Statistical SocietySymbolic or categorical sequences occur in many contexts and can be characterized, for example, by integer-valued intersymbol distances or binary-valued indicator sequences. The analysis of these numerical sequences often sheds light on the properties of the original symbolic sequences. This work introduces new statistical tools for exploring auto-correlation structure in the indicator sequences, for the specific case of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. It is known that the probability distribution of internucleotide distances of DNA sequences deviates significantly from the distribution obtained by assuming independent random placement (i.e. the geometric distribution) and that the deviations can be used either to discriminate between species or to build phylogenetic trees. To investigate the extent to which auto-correlation structure explains these deviations, the 0–1 indicator sequence of each nucleotide (A, C, G and T) is endowed with a binary auto-regressive (AR) model of optimum order. The corresponding binary AR geometric distribution is derived analytically and compared with the observed internucleotide distance distribution by appropriate goodness-of-fit testing. Results in 34 mitochondrial DNA sequences show that the hypothesis of equal observed/expected frequencies is seldom rejected when a binary AR model is considered instead of independence (76/136 versus 125/136 rejections at the 1% level), in spite of χ2 -testing tending to reject for large samples, regardless of how close observed/expected values are. Furthermore, binary AR structure also leads to a median discrepancy reduction of 90% for G, 80% for C, 60% for T and 30% for nucleotide A. Therefore, these models are useful to describe the dependences within a given nucleotide and encourage the development of a model-based framework to compact internucleotide distance information and to understand DNA differences among species further.",

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in which all consenting patients treated with dental implants in a private clinic in Oporto, Portugal, from November 2, 2002 through February 11, 2011 were included. All patients were treated consecutively by the same experimental operator. This study aimed to analyze how the primary outcomes (presence of disease, time of placement, and time of loading) and the secondary outcomes (severity-generalized periodontitis, brand, implant length, prosthesis type, prosthesis metal-ceramic extension) influence the survival rate of dental implants. The survival analysis was performed through the Kaplan-Meier method, and the equality of survival distributions for all groups was tested with the log-rank test with a significance level of .05 for all comparisons. Results: The sample consisted of 202 patients (47% NP and 53% CP) and 689 implants (31% NP and 69% CP). The survival rate in the NP and CP groups showed no statistically significant differences (95.8% versus 93.1%; P ≥ .05). Implants were lost before loading in 54.9% of the cases. The majority of the implants were lost in the first year and stabilized after the second year. Survival rates in the NP and CP patients showed no statistically significant differences when comparing the following factors: subclassification of the disease, implant brands, implant length (short/ standard), type of prosthesis, extension of the prosthesis metal-ceramic, and time of placement and loading (P ≥ .05). Conclusion: This work disclosed no statistically significant differences in terms of survival rates when compared with the control group. Placing implants in patients with a history of periodontal disease appears to be viable and safe.",

Although a decreasing trend has been observed, the WHO guidelines for the PM10 and PM2.5 annual mean concentrations have been exceeded in all monitoring stations. Most inland urban, rural and suburban sites follow a pronounced seasonal variation with much higher values in winter than in summer. Lower levels and a weak seasonal variability were registered in the two urban background stations of Madeira Island, which are permanently under the influence of clean air masses over the Atlantic. Receiving long-range transported pollution, rural stations located in mountain sites presented an opposite seasonal pattern, with higher levels in summer. Diurnal profiles were also analysed and compared between stations. A mining process was also carried out, consisting in the application of multi-scale wavelet transforms, data pattern identification using cluster analysis and examination of the contribution to the total variance/covariance of the time series per wavelet scale for all stations. Groups of stations exhibiting similar variance/covariance profiles were identified. One group contains urban and rural stations with diurnal and daily time scales. Urban background stations located in the island of Madeira constitute another cluster, corresponding to higher wavelet scales (lower periodicity phenomena). One traffic station in the Oporto metropolitan area was grouped with a suburban/industrial station of central Portugal, suggesting the need for reclassification in what concerns the type of environmental influence.",

The origin of such ozone episodes has been widely reported in several studies although uncertainties regarding its origin still remain. This work intends to investigate how the ozone concentrations measured at the Douro Norte nearest stations, located at west and east directions, are related to those measured at Douro Norte by means of coherence and phase transformations methods. The episodes were selected according to the magnitude of the hourly ozone peaks and the occurrence of exceedances of the threshold value at least in two sites. The results point out that 60 % of the selected episodes highlight significant dependence between Douro Norte station and the other two monitoring sites, with different phase signal and a delay range from 2 to 4 h.",

These methods are now evaluated under parasympathetic autonomic blockade, i.e. a condition which tends to difficult the modelling task once the RR variability is dramatically decreased whereas no SBP changes are observed. As expected, fuzzy logic models obtained under vagal blockade have lower modelling error than those obtained in baseline. The pairwise differences between errors in both conditions are positively correlated with differences in SBP LF power and in RR HF power, markers of sympathetic and vagal activity respectively. The methyl-atropine surfaces are flatter than those in baseline, in agreement with the decrease in frequency domain BRS estimates from baseline to drug condition. Finally, fuzzy models obtained under vagal blockade were found to be statistically significant, which strengths the potential of the fuzzy logic approach to model SBP and RR also during vagal blockade.",

This index is defined as the ratio between the right canine mesiodistal dimension and the mandibular canine arch width. The aim of this study was to contribute to sex estimation using dental techniques by analysing the MCI efficiency, and to propose a new approach for its use. Measurements were taken from 120 plaster casts (70 females) in the 16–30 year age group. Although statistically significant sexual dimorphism was observed in both the mesiodistal dimension and the mandibular canine arch width, the MCI showed a low accuracy in sex classification (54.2% correct identifications). This accuracy was improved to 64.2% using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Yet, despite the better accuracy, these results reinforce the idea that the MCI may not be particularly useful in sex prediction, since it may not reflect the same degree of sexual dimorphism as its absolute measures.",

The resulting individual profiles are embedded in a wavelet decomposition-based clustering algorithm in order to identify groups of stations exhibiting similar profiles. The results of the cluster analysis identify three groups of stations, namely urban, suburban/urban/rural, and a third group containing all but one rural stations. The results clearly indicate a geographical pattern among urban stations, distinguishing those located in Lisbon area from those located in Oporto/North. Furthermore, for urban stations, intra-diurnal and daily time scales exhibit the highest variance. This is due to the more relevant chemical activity occurring in high NO2 emissions areas which are responsible for high variability on daily profiles. These chemical processes also explain the reason for NO2 and O3 being highly negatively cross-correlated in suburban and urban sites as compared with rural stations. Finally, the clustering analysis also identifies sites which need revision concerning classification according to environment/ influence type.",

Non-reactive and reactive pastes were prepared, based on tricalcium phosphate doped with 5 mol% (Sr-TCP) that was synthesised by co-precipitation. The varied experimental parameters included: (i) the heat treatment temperature within the range of 800-1100 °C; (ii) different milling extents of calcined powders; (iii) the liquid-to-powder ratio (LPR); (iv) the use of powder blends with different particle sizes (PS) and particle size distributions (PSD); (v) the partial replacement of fine powders by large spherical dense granules prepared via freeze granulation method to simulate coarse individual particles. The aim was contributing to better understanding of the effects of PS, PSD, morphology and state of aggregation of the starting powders on injectability of pastes produced thereof. Powders heat treated at 800 and 1000 °C with different morphologies but with similar apparent PSD curves obtained by milling/blending originated completely injectable reactive cement pastes at low LPR. This contrasted with non-reactive systems prepared thereof under the same conditions. Hypotheses were put forward to explain why the injectability results collected upon extruding non-reactive pastes cannot be directly transposed to reactive systems. The results obtained underline the interdependent roles of the different powder features and ionic strength in the liquid media on determining the flow and injectability behaviours.",

Graphical abstract The present study discloses a systematic study about the influence of some relevant experimental variables on injectability of calcium phosphate cements. Non-reactive and reactive pastes were prepared, based on tricalcium phosphate doped with 5mol% (Sr-TCP) that was synthesised by co-precipitation. The varied experimental parameters included: (i) the heat treatment temperature within the range of 800–1100°C; (ii) different milling extents of calcined powders; (iii) the liquid-to-powder ratio (LPR); (iv) the use of powder blends with different particle sizes (PS) and particle size distributions (PSD); (v) the partial replacement of fine powders by large spherical dense granules prepared via freeze granulation method to simulate coarse individual particles. The aim was contributing to better understanding of the effects of PS, PSD, morphology and state of aggregation of the starting powders on injectability of pastes produced thereof. Powders heat treated at 800 and 1000°C with different morphologies but with similar apparent PSD curves obtained by milling/blending originated completely injectable reactive cement pastes at low LPR. This contrasted with non-reactive systems prepared thereof under the same conditions. Hypotheses were put forward to explain why the injectability results collected upon extruding non-reactive pastes cannot be directly transposed to reactive systems. The results obtained underline the interdependent roles of the different powder features and ionic strength in the liquid media on determining the flow and injectability behaviours. Keywords Calcium phosphates Bone cements Injectability Aggregation state Particle size distribution 1 Introduction Calcium phosphate bone cements (CPC) have attracted much attention in recent years opening up a new era in the medical applications since early 1980s [1,2]. CPC offer numerous attractive advantages including resorbability, osteoconductivity, resemblance with chemical bone composition, capability to establish chemical bonds with the hard tissues, fast setting time, excellent mouldability, outstanding biocompatibility, etc. [3–7]. CPC also provide the opportunity for bone grafting using alloplastic materials, which are unlimited in quantity and provide no risk for infectious diseases [7]. Injectability and the practically isothermal in situ setting offer great opportunities to decrease the invasiveness and painfulness of surgeries, reduced recovery time and increase the overall benefits for the patient and the medical system [8,9]. However, the commercially available CPC formulations are not completely satisfactory [10,11]. The main shortcomings include insufficient mechanical strength and poor injectability. These properties are crucial for bone graft applications in surgical procedures for the correction of vertebral compression fractures, usually caused by osteoporosis. The currently used polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) based cements injected into the vertebra offer good compressive strength but unsatisfactory fatigue resistance [12] and the high exothermicity of the polymerisation reactions might cause extensive necrosis [4,5,7,13]. The monomer toxicity and the inability to participate in the biological processes of bone remodelling constitute other weak points of PMMA based cements [3,6]. These concerns drove the search for CPC with improved flow and mechanical properties in the recent years. But achieving CPC pastes with good injectability still remains a major challenge as flow properties are affected by several factors such as: (i) average particle size (PS) and particle size distributions (PSD) of the starting powders; (ii) fraction and nature of the phases presented; (iii) the presence of strongly bonded particles (aggregates); (iv) particles shape; (v) liquid-to-powder ratio (LPR); (vi) the presence of rheological modifiers and/or additives with specific roles [4–6,14–27]. Injectability is expressed as the percentage of paste that can be extruded from a syringe, ideally in a homogeneous way under an applied force [17]. The eventual occurrence of solid/liquid segregation (also known as filter pressing effect) during injection worsens or even hinders injectability [14,17,24]. In such circumstances the firstly extruded paste contains more liquid than the initial mixture. This paste heterogeneity increases extrusion load and might clog the cannula and block the process, leaving retained paste in the syringe that contains less amount of liquid than the initial mixture. Narrow PSD and the presence of aggregates (strongly bonded particles) tend to confer a shear thickening behaviour to the pastes and increase their tendency to segregate upon extrusion. Increasing the viscosity of mixing liquid is a common strategy to decrease the filter pressing effect and enhance injectability, but further work is required to better understand how to control the flow behaviour [15,17,23,24]. Therefore, drawing firm conclusions about the effects of each experimental variable is difficult when several factors are concomitantly changed, as it happens in a complex reactive CPC paste made of ill characterised powders. Simplifications were attempted in studies carried out with non-reactive systems (aqueous suspensions of tricalcium phosphate, β-Ca3(PO4)2–β-TCP) [14,17,28], but no systematic efforts were made towards discriminating between the size of particles and the size of aggregates. The main limitations towards evaluating the specific effects of each experimental variable on injectability are: (i) the lack of well characterised powders in what concerns PS and PSD; (ii) the frequent confusion between PS and aggregates size; and (iii) the limited size range of the practically achievable non-aggregates particles. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to contribute to a better clarification about the effects of particle size and particle size distribution and state of aggregation on the injectability and filter pressing effect of CPC pastes. For that, non-setting and setting pastes from strontium-doped tricalcium phosphate (Sr-TCP) powders calcined at different temperatures (800–1100°C) and milled for different times (0, 6 and 12min), as well as some powder blends, were considered. Furthermore, relatively large individual particles (spherical granules) of the same material were prepared and added in controlled amounts to the previous formulations to enlarge the PS scope. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Powders preparation and characterisation The powder selected for the present study was β-TCP doped with 5mol% of strontium (Sr-TCP). Improvements in thermal stability of β-TCP powders [29] as well as high performance of CPC derived from Sr-doped TCP [30] were the reasons for selecting the strontium-doped powders. The Sr-TCP in the present work was prepared by a precipitation method described by Kannan et al. [31] with a few minor modifications reported recently [32]. The precipitated powder was vacuum filtered, dried, ground and sieved through a mesh size of 200μm, divided into four batches and each portion was then heat-treated at one of the following temperatures (800, 900, 1000 and 1100°C) in air (Thermolab furnace, Pt30%Rh/Pt6%Rh-thermocouple). The heat treatment schedule included a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1, a dwelling time for 2h at the maximum temperature, followed by natural cooling to room temperature [31]. Each of these powders was submitted to dry milling for different times (6 and 12min) in a 250mL planetary agate mill (weight ratio of balls to powder of 3:1). For each calcination temperature, the following sub-lots of powders were obtained: (i) non-milled; (ii) milled for 6min; and (iii) milled for 12min. The codes for powder samples consist of two parts separated by a hyphen, the first one relative to temperature (800, 900, 1000, 1100°C) and the other to milling time (0, 6, 12min). For example, 800-0 refers to a non-milled powder sample calcined at 800°C, while 1100-12 refers to a powder sample calcined at 1100°C and milled for 12min. All investigated powders were passed through a 40μm sieve. The qualitative analyses of crystalline phases presented in the powders heat-treated at different temperatures were performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a high-resolution Rigaku Geigerflex D/Mac, C Series, diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54096Å). Data sets were recorded in the 2θ range 20–50° with a step size of 0.02° 2θ s−1. Elemental analyses of the powders for Ca, Sr and P were determined using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry (ICP-OES Jobin Yvon Activa M., USA). Particle size distributions of the Sr-TCP powders were measured in a laser scattering instrument (Coulter LS230, Buckinghamshire, UK, Fraunhofer optical model). Specific surface area (SSA) of powders were obtained according to the BET method using a Micromeritics Gemini 2370 V5.00 (Norcross, USA) through the gas adsorption measurements, after degassing the powders in a Micromeritics Flow Prep 060 (Norcross, USA). The morphology and microstructure of the powders heat-treated at different temperatures, before and after milling at different times, were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Tokyo, Japan). 2.2 Granules preparation and characterisation Spherical dense granules might be regarded as individual large particles, thus enabling enlarging the range of available particle sizes and extending the scope of the studies aiming at assessing the effects of PS and PSD on the flow behaviour and injectability. With this purpose, a high concentrated (47vol.% solids) aqueous suspension was prepared from the Sr-TCP powder calcined at 800°C in presence of 0.4wt.% ammonium salt of polyacrylate dispersant (BK Ladenburg, Germany). The suspension was ball milled for several days in order to obtain a well deagglomerated system using a weight ratio of zirconia balls to powder of 3:1. The as deagglomerated powder exhibited a narrow particle size distribution with two particle populations centred at 2.5μm and 0.05μm, and an overall D 50 ≈0.51μm. The suspension was then sprayed into liquid nitrogen (Power Pro freeze granulator LS-2, Gothenburg, Sweden) and the frozen granules were then lyophilised (Labconco, LYPH Lock 4.5, Kansas City, MO) [33]. The dried granules were subsequently sintered at 1150°C in air atmosphere for 2h at 5°Cmin−1 heating rate, and finally separated by size to obtain a size range between 20 and 40μm. Differential thermal analysis (DTA, Setaram Labsys, Setaram Instrumentation, Caluire, France) was used to determine the maximum sintering temperature in order to obtain Sr-TCP granules of β-TCP phase (without α-TCP phase). The evolution of powder morphology with milling time and the microstructure of the sintered granules were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Tokyo, Japan). The density of the granules was determined by helium gas pycnometry (Accupyc Quantachrome apparatus, Florida, USA) and complemented by SEM observation. 2.3 Injectability evaluation 2.3.1 Preparation of the pastes Non-setting pastes (non-reactive systems that do not harden over time) were prepared by mixing 6g of each Sr-TCP powder sample with an aqueous solution of 3wt.% of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Sigma–Aldrich, Germany) using liquid to powder ratios (LPR) of 0.28, 0.34, 0.4 and 0.6gmL−1. Setting pastes (reactive systems) were also prepared by mixing in a 1:1 wt. ratio, Sr-TCP powders and monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM, Sigma–Aldrich, Germany) in a total of 6g, with an aqueous solution containing 3wt.% PVP+15wt.% citric acid (CA, 400, Sigma–Aldrich, Germany)+0.5wt.% hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose (HPMC, 5mPas at 2% by mass, Sigma–Aldrich, Germany) using different LPR of 0.28, 0.34, 0.4gmL−1. The influence of replacing 10wt.% of Sr-TCP powders by large sintered granules on the injectability of both reactive and non-reactive pastes was also evaluated. Table 1 summarises all the investigated pastes and their respective sample codes. As an example, P-800-6-G denotes a non-reactive paste (P), prepared from the 800-6 powder, and containing 10wt.% of granules (G). Sample codes for reactive pastes are similar, substituting P by CP, such as, CP-800-6-G. 2.3.2 Injectability tests Injectability tests were performed as described in earlier studies [14,17,28,34–36] by using a 10mL syringe (15mm diameter and 80mm in length) fitted with a cannula of 2.2mm inner diameter and 91mm in length. The paste (6g powder+required amount of liquid) was hand-mixed for 1min and then placed into the syringe. The extrusion set was placed in a suitable homemade fixture device and put in a testing machine (Shimadzu Autograph, trapezium 2, Japan). The extrusion was performed at room temperature (RT=20°C) being always initiated 2min after starting mixing the paste. The crosshead speed and the maximum load were fixed at 15mmmin−1 up [23,24,35,36] and 500N, respectively. This maximum load was selected to cover the entire range of applied forces and include all types of injection devices (manual, injector guns) and for enlarging the regime of filter pressing effect. Minimizing LPR values while keeping high injectability levels are the key points to develop high strength CPC cements. With this in mind, in the search for an optimised PSD, pastes prepared from blends of the most performing powders were also tested at the lowest LPR (0.28mLg−1). The percentage of injectability was determined as the mass of the paste that could be expelled from the syringe divided by the initial mass of the paste inside the syringe [17,35,36]. Each injectability experiment was repeated three times and the average values were calculated. Paste samples were collected every 30±2s counted from the beginning of the extrusion process for evaluating the filter pressing effect. Any remaining paste in the syringe (when complete extrusion did not occur) was also collected. These samples were weighed before and after complete drying at 120°C for 24h to determine their LPR values. 2.4 Zeta potential and electrical conductivity in different electrolyte solutions The powder blend 800-(50:50) was selected to assess the specific effects of the additives in the reacting liquid and ionic strength on zeta potential (ZP) and electrical conductivity (EC). The measurements were carried out using a Zeta Sizer (Nano ZS, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) at several pH values. For this, 13mg of powder was ultrasonically dispersed for 15min into 50mL of each aqueous electrolyte solution tested using 1mM KCl as background electrolyte. Each dilute suspension was divided into two equal parts, one for increasing and the other for decreasing pH runs, and the pH values were adjusted by using 0.1M solutions of either 0.1M NaOH or 0.1M HCl, respectively. 2.5 Influence of preparation conditions on the flow behaviour of pastes To evaluate the influence of the dispersing/reacting liquids on the flow behaviour and injectability, the powders 800-6, 800-12 and their 800-(50:50) blend were selected. Pastes at various LPR (0.45, 0.40, 0.35, and 0.28mLg−1) were prepared with deionised water, NaCl 3M, in the complete reacting liquid, and in aqueous solutions of each separate additive used in the reacting liquid (0.5wt.% HPMC, 3wt.% PVP, or 15wt.% CA). Viscosity measurements were performed using a rotational Rheometer (Kinexus pro+, Malvern, UK) equipped with a cone and plate (2°, 25mm, and gap of 70μm) measuring configuration. The flow measurements were conducted between 0.1 and 100s−1 at 20°C. For each test, 2g of powder was mixed with each testing liquid at various LPR for 1min to form a homogeneous paste. The rheological measurement was always initiated 2min after starting mixing the paste to ensure the same rheological history during the preparation of all the pastes. 2.6 Statistical methods and data analysis Table 1 summarises the codes of pastes prepared from the different powder samples. The corresponding PSD curves are displayed in Fig. 2, with distributional features/percentiles reported in Table 2 . The injectability of the pastes prepared from the different powder samples (without and with replacement of 10wt.% of Sr-TCP powder by 10% of granules) was evaluated for non-reactive and reactive systems (Figs. 6 and 7, respectively, with data points representing average values of three independent experiments). Along the text, injectability data were expressed as means±standard deviations. The filter pressing effect was evaluated by the significance of the variations in LPR (three independent experiments) undergone upon the extrusion of each paste (Tables 3–5 ) and quantified from repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse–Geisser correction and statistical significance for p <0.05. The pairwise comparisons between the chosen/blend powder samples and the reference one (1000-12) considered: (i) differences in particle size distributions (Fig. 8, with the evaluation of the discrepancy between distributions, D, as the integral of the absolute differences between two cumulative distributions); (ii) differences in injectability (Fig. 9 with statistical significance for p <0.05 assessed by t-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The conclusions from parametric statistical analysis were corroborated in all cases with the non-parametric counterparts, due to the small sample size (Friedman test for the repeated measures ANOVA and Mann–Whitney U test for the t-test). All statistical analyses were conducted in IBM® SPSS® Statistics (Version 21.0) and graphical displays were developed in Matlab® (R2006a). ZP and EC were evaluated for the 800-(50:50) powder dispersed in different electrolyte solutions (Fig.10(a)and (b)). Three measurements were performed for each testing condition and the average values and standard deviations were calculated. 3 Results 3.1 Characterisation of starting powders The results of ICP analysis revealed that a Sr content of 5.02mol% was retained in the lattice of the Sr-TCP powder, in good agreement with the planned Ca2.85 Sr0.15(PO4)2 composition. The XRD patterns of Sr-TCP powder samples heat-treated at 800°C, 900°C, 1000°C and 1100°C displayed in Fig. 1 reveal that all samples consist of β-TCP, β-Ca3(PO4)2, ICDD PDF 04-001-7104, also coinciding with the standard (Ca2.83Sr0.17)(PO4)2 phase containing 5.6(6)mol% Sr (ICDD PDF 01-076-8438) [37]. This coincidence means that lattice distortions in β-TCP caused by the atomic replacement [31,38,39] are too small to be noticed in agreement with previous studies [31,37]. The volume based differential PSD curves of the different powder samples are displayed in Fig. 2 . The most salient features of 800-0 include a quite broad PSD with D 50 around 6.7μm, comprising a small population of particles at ∼2.4μm and a more intense population of coarser particles centred at ∼18μm. Milling caused narrowing of PSD and the upsurge of two distinct populations with varying intensities in 800-6. The bimodal features accentuated with milling extent and D 50 decreased to 0.7μm for sample 800-12, with the most intense population of fine particles centred at 0.6μm and a smaller population of coarser particles centred at 2.4μm. These coarser populations presented in 800-6 and 800-12 powders are likely to consist more of small aggregates of primary particles than of coarse individual ones. The PSD parameters (including D 10, D 50, and D 90, as well as BET SSA) of the powders are presented in Table 2. The data enable concluding about a clear increase of PS and a concomitant decrease of SSA as calcination temperature increased. Moreover, increasing the milling time resulted in a gradual size reduction, accompanied by an increase of SSA, confirming the effects expected from milling. Fig. 3 shows the morphological SEM features of non-milled powders heat-treated at all temperatures, while Fig. 4 depicts the influence of milling on the morphology for the powders heat-treated at 800°C and 1100°C. The less magnified SEM micrographs of Fig. 3 show overall views of dispersed particles/aggregates deposited over the metallic supports, while the higher magnified inserts show clear details about the gradual sintering effects upon increasing the heat treatment temperature. The micrographs shown in Fig. 4 confirm the strong aggregation effect of calcination temperature and the importance of the milling process in destroying the aggregates. 3.2 Characterisation of the Sr-TCP granules The starting suspension exhibited an appropriate shear thinning behaviour (not shown) for the preparation of the granules. The DTA curve (not shown) exhibited an exothermic peak centred at 1209°C, which was attributed to the β→α phase transformation. Based on this result, 1150°C was selected as the sintering temperature for the granules. The morphology of sintered granules can be observed in the SEM micrographs presented in Fig. 5 , confirming the high degrees of sphericity and density. The SEM observation of the internal cross sections of some granules revealed only a few small pores. The experimental density achieved upon sintering, was 3.055±0.06gcm−3, corresponding to relative density of ∼97%. 3.3 Injectability and filter pressing effect of pastes 3.3.1 Non-reactive systems The results of injectability of non-setting pastes without and with added 10wt.% granules are present in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), respectively. From non-milled powders, injectability could be solely performed for LPR=0.6mLg−1. Fig. 6(a) reveals that injectability was improved with increasing milling times and LPR. From non-milled powders, only the P-1100-0 paste could be partially extruded at the lower LPR values (0.34 and 0.4mLg−1), achieving 32.8±0.4% and 48.1±0.2% of injectability, respectively. The increase of LPR to 0.6mLg−1 allowed the extrusion of all the pastes derived from non-milled powders. The highest value of injectability (95.8±0.8%) was obtained for P-1100-0, while the lowest one (46.4±1.5%) was observed for P-800-0. All the pastes prepared from powder milled for 12min could be more extensively extruded in comparison to the ones derived from powders non-milled or milled for 6min. For example, at the LPR=0.34mLg−1, the injectability values for P-1000-12 and P-1100-12 were as high as 95.2±1.4%, and 95.7±0.7%, respectively. The results displayed in Fig. 6(a) and (b) also reveal that injectability was enhanced by replacing 10wt.% of Sr-TCP powder by the same amount of spherical dense granules that simulate larger individual particles. The larger improvements were achieved for the powder samples calcinated at 800°C and 900°C. The results about the influence of the same experimental variables (calcination temperature, milling time and LPR) on the extent of filter pressing effect are reported in Table 3. Statistical analysis indicated the occurrence of this phenomenon for most of the non-reactive pastes except for the P-1100-0, P-800-12 and P-900-6-G ones. At LPR=0.6mLg−1, the pastes P-800-0, P-900-0, P-1000-0 and P-1100-0 revealed enhanced flowability and decreased trend for solid/liquid phase separation with the heat treatment temperature increasing. Accordingly, no segregation has apparently occurred in P-1100-0, contrarily to the quite visible filter pressing effect in the cases of P-800-0, and P-900-0 pastes. The LPR values for these last pastes at the beginning of the extrusion (A1) were higher than the starting value (0.6mLg−1). This initial liquid enrichment is consistent with the lower LPR values measured for the remaining portion of the paste in the syringe. In the case of paste P-1000-0, a less extended filter pressing effect was only noticed for the A2 sample. For the pastes P-1100-0, the filter pressing effect absent at 0.6mLg−1, became clearly and gradually noticeable with decreasing LPR values. Table 3 also shows that milling for 12min was enough to prevent the filter pressing effect at 0.6mLg−1 for the paste P-800-12, contrarily to the extensive solid/liquid phase separation observed for P-800-0. But milling for 6min was insufficient to eliminate the filter pressing effect at 0.4mLg−1 for the pastes P-800-6 and P-900-6. On the other hand, the filter pressing effect was much mitigated for P-800-6-G and completely prevented for P-900-6-G. 3.3.2 Reactive systems The injectability results of reactive cement pastes at various LPR values, without and with added 10wt.% granules, are presented in Fig. 7 (a) and (b), respectively. Some observable features (enhanced injectability by increasing LPR and decreasing particle/agglomerate sizes) are common to non-reactive systems [14,17]. However, exceptions can also be noticed: (i) the injectability of CP-1100-0>CP-1100-6>CP-1100-12; (ii) increasing the LPR decreased the injectability of CP-1100-6 and CP-1100-12 systems; (iii) at LRP=0.34mLg−1, the injectability of CP-800-12 (84.5±0.8%) was lower than that of CP-800-6 (96.9±0.5%). Pastes from non-milled powders could not be extruded at LRP=0.28mLg−1 and only partially extruded at LPR=0.34mLg−1. The higher values of injectability at 0.34mLg−1 were obtained for CP-800-0 (24.7±2.0%) and CP-1100-0 (24.7±2.3%), and the lower ones were observed for CP-900-0 (3.7±0.9%) and CP-1000-0 (19.5±2.7%). This tendency was maintained at LPR=0.4mLg−1 with CP-800-0 and CP-1100-0 reaching 95.6±2.1 and 97.3±0.2%, respectively. The pastes derived from powder samples milled for 6min could be partially extruded at LPR=0.28mLg−1. The highest injectability value (50.9±2.5%) was obtained for CP-1100-6 while the lowest one (1.8±0.3%) was registered for CP-900-6. Increasing LPR to 0.40mLg−1 enhanced the injectability of the systems CP-800-6 (95.6±2.0%), CP-900-6 (97.4±0.7%) and CP-1000-6 (97.4±0.5%), while worsen that of CP-1100-6 (23.9±1.3%). For the pastes derived from powder samples milled for 12min, the higher injectability values at LPR=0.28mLg−1 were obtained for CP-800-12 (79.7±4.1%) and CP-1000-12 (96.0±0.6%), while the less performing systems were CP-900-12 (33.6±2.2%) and CP-1100-12 (35.6±2.1%). Comparing the injectability results for the pastes without (Fig. 7(a)) and with added 10wt.% of granules (Fig. 7(b)), slight increases are observed in just some cases when granules are present. This small beneficial effect of granules was more evident for CP-900-0-G and CP-1000-0-G at LPR=0.40mLg−1. In the remaining cases, granules worsened the injectability (Fig. 7(b) and Table 4). For the CP-1100-0-G at LPR=0.40mLg−1, injectability decreased from 97.3±0.2wt.% to 35.3±1.8wt.%. At LPR=0.28mLg−1, the liquid was insufficient to wet the non-milled powders+granules, thus preventing extrusion. For reactive pastes, the dependence of filter pressing effect on calcination temperature and milling time can be judged from the results presented in Table 4. The first set of pastes aimed at evaluating the effect of heat treatment temperature, reveals that: (i) at LPR=0.40mLg−1 segregation phenomena apparently did not occur for CP-1100-0 (p>0.05), being noticeable for CP-900-0 and CP-1000-0 ones (p <0.05 for both cases); (ii) the CP-800-0 could be completely extruded, but a slight filter pressing effect has occurred. The second set of experiments aimed at evaluating the effect of LPR in CP-1100-0 pastes. At LPR=0.28mLg−1 no extrudable pastes could be formed. At LPR=0.34mLg−1, an evident solid/liquid phase separation occurred; but this phenomenon was no more apparent at LPR=0.40mLg−1. The third set of experiments was aimed at evaluating the effect of milling for 6min on the filter pressing effect upon extruding the CP-800-0 and CP-800-6 pastes. The filter pressing effect, clearly evident for the CP-800-0 paste at LPR=0.34mLg−1, disappeared in the case of CP-800-6, reflecting the beneficial effect of milling. The last set of pastes, prepared from powders milled for 6min, was intended to investigate the influence of heat treatment temperature (800°C, 900°C) and of adding 10wt.% of granules on the filter pressing effect at a fixed LPR (0.34mLg−1). Segregation did not occur for CP-800-6 and CP-800-6-G, but appeared in the cases of CP-900-6 and CP-900-6-G, being more evident in CP-900-6-G. 3.3.3 Powder blends in reactive systems Considering that: (i) the high injectability values of CP-1000-12 (96.0±0.6%) and CP-800-12 (79.7±4.1%) pastes at the lowest LPR (0.28mLg−1) (Fig. 7(a)); (ii) the jump in injectability of CP-800-6 to 96.9±0.5% when LPR was increased to 0.34mLg−1, it was hypothesised that blends of powders 800-6 and 800-12 could be a viable option to mimic the PSD of the sample CP-1000-12 and thus to enhance the injectability of the pastes. Accordingly, attempts were made to reproduce as much as possible the target PSD of the 1000-12 powder by blending two different powder samples. The selection of this pair of powders was based on the PSD features reported in Table 2 and in Fig. 2. The blend of powders 800-6+800-12 was found to exhibit features similar to the target. The features of the pair 900-6+900-12 were not far, except for D 90 that was significantly higher (Table 2). Powders obtained at 1100°C deviated from the desired target (Fig. 2) and were excluded. Therefore, 5 powders were selected to proceed with this study: 1000-12 (1); 800-6 (2); 800-12 (3); and the blends of the powders 800-6+800-12 in the following weight ratios: 50:50 (4) and 75:25 (5). The corresponding PSD curves are plotted in Fig. 8 (a) and (b). Fig. 8(b) shows that curve 1 (1000-12) is located in between the curves 2 (800-6) and 3 (800-12), corroborating the suitability of the pair 800-6+800-12 for the intended purposes. As a matter of fact, small deviations relative to curve 1 are observed for PSD curves 4 and 5, in good agreement with data reported in Table 2. The best fit was obtained for blend 75:25 (curve 5) showing only a residual discrepancy, D value, between distributions. Fig. 9 shows the injectability results of the reactive pastes derived from the 5 powders selected above at two LPR values. It can be seen that injectability of CP-800-6 was significantly enhanced with LPR increasing from 0.28 to 0.34mLg−1, while the effect was less pronounced for CP-1000-12 and CP-800-12 pastes. The pastes derived from powder blends could be completely extruded even at the lower LPR=0.28mLg−1, confirming the wiseness of these selections. The evolution LPR values along the extrusion process of the pastes prepared from the 5 selected powders is reported in Table 5. The filter pressing effect, evident in CP-800-6 and CP-800-12 systems (p <0.05 for both systems), could not be detected neither in the reference paste CP-1000-12 nor in the cement pastes derived from powder blends (4 and 5). 3.4 Influence of dispersing/reactive liquids on zeta potential and rheology Since the most significant differences between non-reactive and reactive systems were observed for powders heat treated at 800°C, they were selected to investigate the effects of liquids’ composition on their dispersing ability. The plots of ZP and EC of dilute 800-(50:50) systems are displayed in Fig. 10 (a) and (b), respectively. The results for 15wt.% CA are not shown in Fig. 10(a) because fast dissolution of the particles hindered any reliable measurement, in agreement with observations reported elsewhere [21]. The absolute ZP values are close to zero in NaCl 3M, being relatively small in the presence of 3wt.% PVP and presenting a minimum at ∼pH 7.5. The other curves show an increasing trend with pH increasing, especially in the case of KCl 10−3 M. The EC is highest (∼20Sm−1) in NaCl 3M, followed by the measured for the 15wt.% CA-containing systems (∼0.7Sm−1) irrespective of the presence of other additives. The remaining EC curves appear almost superimposed and exhibit minima within the neutral pH region. The flow curves of non-reactive P-800-(50:50) pastes prepared with different aqueous solutions at various LPR are displayed in Fig. 11 (a). All the systems exhibit shear thinning behaviours within the entire shear rate range tested. With CA alone, and with the complete reactive liquid (3wt.%PVP+0.5wt.%HPMC+15wt.%CA), the minima LPR values required to wet the powder and form a paste were 0.35 and 0.4mLg−1, respectively. All the other curves (in black) correspond to LPR=0.45mLg−1. In comparison to deionised water: (i) the NaCl 3M solution forms a noticeable less viscous paste; (ii) 3wt.% PVP solution gives significantly higher viscosity values; (iii) the viscosity curve of paste prepared with the less concentrated 0.5wt.% HPMC solution is closer to that of pure water system. The least viscous system was obtained for 15wt.% CA solution. Further adding PVP and HPMC binders to CA solution somewhat enhanced the viscosity of the resulting paste. The shear thinning behaviour is also observed for the reactive systems in Fig. 11(b), with even smoother flow curves. At LPR=0.45mLg−1 the viscosity curve appears above those corresponding to non-reactive pastes. The remaining viscosity curves at LPR=0.28mLg−1 (green) show the following features: (i) CP-800-(50:50) is less viscous than CP-800-6 or CP-800-12; (ii) the paste prepared with CA alone is slightly more viscous that obtained from the complete reactive liquid (3wt.%PVP+0.5wt.%HPMC+15wt.%CA), contrarily to what was observed for non-reactive systems. 4 Discussion The results of ICP analysis revealed an excellent agreement between the planned and the experimentally obtained Sr-TCP compositions. The good match of the XRD patterns (Fig. 1) and the standard files of pure and Sr-doped β-TCP (ICDD PDF 04-001-7104, and ICDD PDF 01-076-8438, respectively) mean that the lattice distortions [31,38,39] are too small to be noticed [31,37]. The precipitated primary Sr-TCP particles brought together by capillary forces upon drying tend to agglomerate through weak chemical bonds by releasing OH surface groups and establishing oxygen bridges. These bonds strengthen and necks are gradually formed as the heat-treatment temperature increases, resulting in the formation of hard agglomerates or even sintered aggregates [40], as illustrated in the SEM micrographs of Figs. 3 and 4. This explains why PSD curves displayed in Fig. 2 became gradually broader with increasing the heat-treatment temperatures. The as formed aggregates are likely to be at least partially destroyed by milling. This process is easier for the powders heat-treated at lower temperatures that promote less extended neck formation among the primary particles [40]. The SEM micrographs presented in Fig. 4 confirm the strong aggregation effect of calcination temperature and the importance of the milling process in destroying the aggregates, in good agreement with the results displayed in Fig. 2 and Table 2. The SEM micrograph of 800-12 powder (Fig. 4, a3) shows assemblages of small particles brought together by capillary action upon the evaporation of the dispersing water (soft agglomerates). A first glance comparison of these relatively large particle assemblages with the smaller ones seen in the SEM micrograph of 1100-12 (Fig. 4, b3) might be misleading. Moreover, the coarser aggregates present in the powder calcined at 1100°C are likely to sediment before collecting the dilute suspension droplet onto the metallic support used for SEM analysis. The grain growth and the extensive neck formation among the primary particles heat treated at 1100°C confer a more compact and cohesive structure to the aggregates (Fig. 3), explaining the smaller specific surface area in comparison to the sample calcined at 800°C (Table 2). These powder characteristics are expected to affect their reactivity when in contact with the liquid medium. The micrographs presented in Fig. 5 reveal that freeze granulation from the 47vol.% suspension of 800-0 powder (D 50 ≈0.51μm) was effective for preparing spherical granules and sintering the granules at 1150°C enabled achieving high degree of density. The high relative density of ∼97%, (3.055±0.06gcm3) is consistent with the good dispersion of the Sr-TCP powder in the starting suspension. Sintering at a temperature that is 59°C below the one corresponding to the β→α phase transformation (1209°C, as determined by DTA) also accounted for the high level of densification achieved. Considering that pure β-TCP undergoes β→α phase transformation at ∼1125°C [41–44], these results indicate that thermal stability was enhanced for ∼84°C by doping β-TCP with 5mol% Sr. For non-reactive systems, the pastes prepared from powders heat-treated at lower temperatures (800 and 900°C) required higher LPR to be injected and were more prone to undergo solid/liquid phase separation upon extrusion in comparison to those derived from powders calcined at higher temperatures (1000 and 1100°C) (Table 3). This is consistent with the higher densification degrees (Figs. 3 and 4) and the lower values of SSA (Table 2) of the last powders, which will trap less liquid in the intra-agglomerate pores, thus availing more liquid to enhance the flow (Fig. 6(a)). On the other hand, strongly bonded particles moving together will make the flow more difficult because of their mutual collisions and risks of clogging the cannula. This tendency for hindering the flow and form a slow moving or stopped porous paste bed is the well-known filter pressing effect. Therefore, destroying rigid particle aggregates that might clog the cannulas is a fundamental step to improve injectability of pastes and to mitigate the filter pressing effect. This is confirmed by the highest injectability combined with the absence of filter pressing effect observed for the P-1100-12 system (Fig. 6(a) and Table 3). Injectability was also significantly enhanced by partially replacing irregularly shaped aggregates by spherical granules (Fig. 6(b) and Table 3) that simulate uniform larger particles (Fig. 5). These improvements can be attributed to the regular shape of granules, the change in size ratio, and packing ability, and to less liquid trapped in the intra-aggregate pore spaces [45]. Therefore, higher LPR will be required to enable pastes made of aggregated powders to flow in a homogeneous way. Table 3 confirms that liquid phase migration upon extrusion occurred preferentially in systems with lower LPR. These results are in agreement with the existing consensus that increasing LPR facilitates the injectability [16] as observed in Fig. 6. In general, increasing LPR and milling time facilitated injectability of both non-reactive (Fig.6(a)and(b)) and reactive systems (Fig.7(a)and(b)) [14,17]. The extended filter pressing effect observed especially for non-reactive pastes derived from powders calcined at lower temperatures became less evident in the case of reactive systems (Table 4). Moreover, the noticeable improvements in injectability with increasing calcination temperature observed for non-reactive pastes were not verified for reactive systems (Fig.7(a)). These differences in flow properties between reactive and non-reactive systems suggest that the relevance of particle/agglomerate size and size distribution is not the same in these different systems, supporting the explanatory hypothesis suggested above. Other influencing factors come into play in the more complex reactive systems and, among the powders’ features particle/aggregate size distribution seems the most relevant one, especially at the lower LPR values. On the other hand, the relatively high ionic strength of the reacting liquid contributed to mitigate the occurrence of filter pressing effect in comparison to non-reactive pastes prepared from powders calcined at lower temperatures (Table 4). The overall results suggest that the particle/aggregate size distribution is the key factor that mostly determines injectability of cement pastes. In fact, powder blends with an overall PSD close to that of the standard powder 1000-12 (Fig. 8) performed similarly upon extrusion (Fig. 9 and Table 5). Several models [48–52] have been proposed to explain the enhanced packing ability of binary, ternary or even multimodal particle size systems by mixing in various proportions different sized particles. Furnas model [48] is particularly useful for predicting the optimal packing of powder blends, with the smaller particles occupying the interstitial spaces among the larger ones. Farris [53] explain the viscosity reduction that follows from mixing discretely sized particles with sufficiently large size ratios, considering that the suspension could be regarded as a coarse fraction suspended in a fluid containing the finer particles, with all fractions behaving independently of each other. The limited benefits in terms of injectability of reactive pastes containing coarse spherical granules (Fig. 7(b)) can be attributed to the excessively large size granule/particle ratio, contrasting with the observations made for non-reactive systems in which granules enhanced injectability. The lower viscosity of CP-800-(50:50) in comparison to CP-800-6 or CP-800-12, Fig. 11(b), reflects the enhanced packing ability of the powder blend in agreement with the Furnas [48] and Farris [53] models. Considering the small differences between the viscosity curves of CP-800-6 and CP-800-12, the lower viscosity of CP-800-(50:50), and the noticeable differences in injectability of these systems (Fig. 9), it seems clear that injectability is much more sensitive to variations in PSD than viscosity alone. One of the most salient differences of reactive systems is the lower amount of liquid required for injecting the pastes (Fig. 7) in comparison to non-reactive ones (Fig. 6). In fact, all cement pastes, except those prepared with non-milled powders, could be partially or totally extruded at LPR=0.28mLg−1 (Fig. 7(a)). This seems strange considering the expected increase in viscosity involved in hydraulic setting reactions. However, a number of reasons could be alleged to explain the enhanced flowing ability of reactive systems: (i) the presence of ionic species derived from CA and/or HPMC and PVP in the setting liquid may change the interparticle forces and the packing ability. It is known that interparticle forces have significant effects on the ability of particles to pack in suspensions or pastes [20,21,46]; (ii) dissolution reactions that increase the ionic strength of the liquid, which in turn tends to collapse the electrical double layers around the particles enabling them to approach up to closer distances [47]. This explanatory hypothesis is supported by the almost null ZP in the presence of NaCl 3M (Fig. 10(a)), the correspondingly high EC (Fig. 10(b)), and the noticeably lower viscosity in comparison to that of non-reactive paste made with deionised water (Fig. 11(a)). This was further proved by comparing the feasibility of preparing non-reactive pastes from 800-6 at LPR=0.34mLg−1 using pure water or NaCl 3M solution. The powder was not completely wetted by deionised water, contrasting with a flowable paste obtained with NaCl 3M. With CA or (CA+PVP+HPMC) solutions, minima LPR values of 0.35 and 0.4mLg−1, respectively, were required for forming (non-necessarily extrudable) non-reactive pastes (Fig. 11(a)). These values are noticeably higher than 0.28mLg−1 used to prepare extrudable reactive systems (Fig. 11(b)). On the other hand, at LPR=0.45mLg−1 the non-reactive pastes prepared with 15wt.% CA or (3wt.%PVP+0.5wt.%HPMC+15wt.%CA) solutions are noticeably less viscous in comparison to the other systems at the same LPR (Fig. 11(a)). This enhanced fluidity of CA-containing pastes is likely to be due to two concomitant and concurrent effects: (i) surface adsorption of citrate ions, accentuating the negative ZP values [20,21]; (ii) increase of ionic strength derived from dissolution of β-TCP and the acidic environment. Such significant flow ability differences between non-reactive and reactive pastes are likely to derive mostly from the huge increase in ionic strength derived from the acidic pH values of 15wt.% CA and (3wt.%PVP+0.5wt.%HPMC+15wt.%CA) solutions and the partial dissolution of MCPM and β-TCP in reactive systems. This is supported by the impossibility of measuring any reliable ZP values in CA-containing solutions and by the noticeable EC values measured in the presence of 15wt.% CA and (3wt.%PVP+0.5wt.%HPMC+15wt.%CA) Fig. 10(b). In summary, the most salient differences between reactive and non-reactive systems can be explained by the significant increase in ionic strength in the case of reactive pastes, collapsing the electrical double layers around the particles. The apparent size of the particles decreases and the interactions among them are mediated by short range lubricating forces [47]. Another important factor is the replacement of 50% of β-TCP by MCPM in reactive systems. Further, real complex particle size variations that are hard to describe in detail, are also expected from the dissolution/precipitation and setting reactions. Due to thermodynamic reasons, the sharpener corners of the particles will firstly undergo dissolution. This will favour the particles sliding over each other, also contribution to enhance the flowability and injectability of reactive pastes. 5 Conclusions This work demonstrates that knowledge acquired upon using non-reactive systems regarding the effects of powder features (PS, PSD, state of aggregation) cannot be directly transposed to the setting cement pastes prepared from the same powders. The collapse of the electrical double layers around the particles and the surge of short range lubricating forces are consistent with injectability tests performed under high ionic strength conditions (3M NaCl), supporting the explanatory hypothesis proposed. Accordingly, the overall injectability results for reactive systems revealed that under the set of fixed experimental conditions used, particle/aggregate size distribution is the most determining factor, as confirmed by the excellent injectability of pastes derived from powders with significant differences in SSA (CP-1000-12 and CP-50:50 and CP-75:25). Partially aggregated particle might behave like individual particles and enhance injectability, provided that they are integrated in an overall continuous and relatively large PSD. The partial replacement of fine and/or insufficiently milled (aggregate) powders by regular shaped dense granules might be promising, provided that granules with suitable sizes can be prepared to generate blends with proper PSD. Future research will be required towards optimising PS and PSD preferentially of non-aggregate particles.

Within this context, extreme value theory provides a powerful tool to quantify the probability of a long RR occurrence, through the statistical characterization of the RR tail distribution. Here, tail characterization does not rely on the Gaussian assumption but by fitting the Generalized Pareto distribution (GPd) to the excesses above a properly chosen high threshold, and through the analysis of its corresponding tail index, denoted as γ. The new approach is illustrated with a 24-h RR recording from a normal subject and a Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patient. Wavelet analysis allowed to reconstruct one signal containing the RR power traditionally related to respiratory rhythm (∼ 0.25 Hz) and another to sympathetic baroreflex activity (∼ 0.1 Hz). The fitted distributions for the normal subject do not reject the hypothesis of γ = 0 for both LF and HF while γ > 0 for the CHF patient. Thus, the CHF distributions are heavy-tailed, indicating a non-negligible probability that a very long RR interval can occur. In a forthcoming study, it will be assessed the impact of these preliminary findings in CHF mortality prediction.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2015 Authors.Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS) is an important prognostic factor because a reduced BRS has been associated with an adverse cardiovascular outcome. The threshold for a 'reduced' BRS was established by the ATRAMI study at BRS < 3 ms/mmHg in patients with a previous myocardial infarction, and has been shown to improve risk assessment in many other cardiac dysfunctions. The successful application of this cut-offto other populations suggests that it may reflect an inherent property of baroreflex functioning, so our goal is to investigate whether it represents a 'natural' partition of BRS values. As reduced baroreflex responsiveness is also associated with ageing, we investigated whether a BRS estimate < 3 ms/mmHg could be the result of a process of physiological senescence as well as a sign of BRS dysfunction. This study involved 228 chronic heart failure patients and 60 age-matched controls. Our novel method combined transfer function BRS estimation and automatic clustering of BRS probability distributions, to define indicative levels of different BRS activities. The analysis produced a fit clustering (cophenetic correlation coefficient 0.9 out of 1) and identified one group of homogeneous patients (well separated from the others by 3 ms/mmHg) with an increased BRS-based mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR): 3.19 (1.73, 5.89), P < 0.001]. The age-dependent BRS cut-off, estimated by 5% quantile regression of log (BRS) with age (considering the age-matched controls), provides a similar mortality value [HR: 2.44 (1.37, 4.43), P = 0.003]. In conclusion, the 3 ms/mmHg cut-offidentifies two large clusters of homogeneous heart failure (HF) patients, thus supporting the hypothesis of a natural cut-offin the HF population. Furthermore, age was found to have no statistical impact on risk assessment, suggesting that there is no need to establish age-based cut-offs because 3 ms/mmHg optimally identifies patients at high mortality risk.",

        "doc_abstract": "© IAWF 2014.Forest fires are a major concern in Europe, particularly in Portugal where large forest fires are responsible for negative environmental, social and economic effects. In this work, a long time series of daily area burned in 18 Portuguese districts (north, coastal areas and inner-south) from 1980 to 2010 are analysed to characterise extreme area burned and regional variability. The analysis combines the peak-over-threshold method and classification techniques to cluster the time series on the basis either of their corresponding tail indices or their predictive distributions for 5- and 15-year return values, that is, the level that is exceeded on average once every 5 or 15 years. As previously reported in other wildfire studies, the results show that the distributions of area burned (1980-2010) are heavy tailed for all Portuguese districts, with considerable density in the tail, indicating a non-negligible probability of occurrence of days with very large area burned. Moreover, clustering based on tail indices identified three distinct groups with spatial pattern closely related to the percentage of shrub cover within each district. Finally, clustering based on return values shows that the largest return levels of area burned are expected to occur in districts located in the centre and south of Portugal.",

        "doc_abstract": "Heart rate and blood pressure are the most important vital signs in diagnosing disease. Both heart rate and blood pressure are characterized by a high degree of short term variability from moment to moment, medium term over the normal day and night as well as in the very long term over months to years. The study of new mathematical algorithms to evaluate the variability of these cardiovascular parameters has a high potential in the development of new methods for early detection of cardiovascular disease, to establish differential diagnosis with possible therapeutic consequences. The autonomic nervous system is a major player in the general adaptive reaction to stress and disease. The quantitative prediction of the autonomic interactions in multiple control loops pathways of cardiovascular system is directly applicable to clinical situations. Exploration of new multimodal analytical techniques for the variability of cardiovascular system may detect new approaches for deterministic parameter identification. A multimodal analysis of cardiovascular signals can be studied by evaluating their amplitudes, phases, time domain patterns, and sensitivity to imposed stimuli, i.e., drugs blocking the autonomic system. The causal effects, gains, and dynamic relationships may be studied through dynamical fuzzy logic models, such as the discrete-time model and discrete-event model. We expect an increase in accuracy of modeling and a better estimation of the heart rate and blood pressure time series, which could be of benefit for intelligent patient monitoring. We foresee that identifying quantitative mathematical biomarkers for autonomic nervous system will allow individual therapy adjustments to aim at the most favorable sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. © 2013 Campos, Pereira, Muralikrishna, Albarwani, Brás and Gouveia.",

The well-known Cerebral State Index (CSI) quantifies depth of anesthesia and is traditionally modeled with Hill equation and propofol effect-site concentration (Ce). This work brings out two novelties: introduction of electromyogram (EMG) and use of fuzzy logic models with ANFIS optimized parameters. The data were collected from dogs (n =27) during routine surgery considering two propofol administration protocols: constant infusion (G1, n =14) and bolus (G2, n =13). The median modeling error of the fuzzy logic model with Ce and EMG was lower or similar than that of the Hill with Ce (p =0.012-G1, p =0.522-G2). Furthermore, there was no significant performance impact due to model structure alteration (p =0.288-G1, p =0.330-G2) and EMG introduction increased or maintained the performance (p =0.036-G1, p =0.798-G2). Therefore, the new model can achieve higher performance than Hill model, mostly due to EMG information and not due to changes in the model structure. In conclusion, the fuzzy models adequately describe CSI data with advantages over traditional Hill models. Keywords Depth of anesthesia CSI EMG Dog Fuzzy logic model Hill equation 1 Introduction The increasing complexity of surgical procedures calls for more advanced anesthetic techniques (Barash et al., 2009). While considerable advances have been made in human anesthesia techniques, the same cannot be said about veterinary anesthesia. As a matter of fact, the techniques used for humans are currently adapted for animal use, e.g., the automatic evaluation of depth of anesthesia (DoA). Nevertheless, the need for support/automatic systems to monitor and induce a stable DoA assume a high importance in veterinary practice, which would yield significant improvements in patients’ welfare under general anesthesia, diminishing side effects. A DoA monitor provides a useful and friendly display of the patient’s anesthesia level, allowing a proper adjustment of hypnotic drug needs to balance the drug-effect relation. Since increased DoA is associated with decreased brain electrical activity, several electroencephalogram (EEG) derived indexes for monitoring DoA have been developed for humans (White et al., 2004; Ekman et al., 2004; Iannuzzi et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2005). As an example, the Cerebral State Index (CSI) has shown promising results with dogs’ data, as reported by Bollen and Saxtorph (2006) and Ribeiro et al. (2008). The validation of a DoA index can be carried out with mathematical models that estimate it as a function of physiological variables. The CSI is traditionally modeled using the Hill equation, which takes into account the effect-site concentration (Ce), which briefly is the concentration of hypnotics in the brain, and reflects its effect on brain electric activity. The CSI monitor acquires an electric activity signal using facial electrodes, and makes use of band pass filters to obtain the EEG and the electromyography (EMG) (Danmeter A/S, 2006). During surgery, the EEG exhibits typically lower frequencies than EMG. Nevertheless, since EEG and EMG frequency bands are overlapped above approximately 30Hz (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007), it is likely that the EMG acquired by the CSI monitor contain EEG information of high frequencies, as reported by Jensen et al. (2006): “It cannot be ruled out that the CSI has some influence of facialis electromyography”. This work presents a novel model to describe the CSI as a function of Ce and EMG, with application in dogs’ data. While Ce and EMG are related, there is no established mathematical model relationship between them. In this framework, fuzzy logic methods have been used to describe the unknown input–output relationship, combining both empirical rules and information extracted from the experimental data itself (Kovacic and Bogdan, 2006). Additionally, the fact that the system under study is highly variable, due to patients’ different reactions to similar stimulus, justifies the use of fuzzy models that weighs rules and permits a grey zone (not only “1” or “0”) allowing a better modeling of overall patient reaction (Kovacic and Bogdan, 2006). Fuzzy methods are easy to interpret as the model output can be written as a weighted linear combination of the system inputs, and constitute a generic framework for uncertainty handling. These methods have multiple applications (Kovacic and Bogdan, 2006), e.g., a fuzzy model had already been presented for analgesia score evaluation, relating the propofol and remifentanil concentrations with different DoA indices (Gambús et al., 2011). Although hypnotics like propofol are not muscle relaxants, they usually induce alterations in muscle activity (Ribeiro et al., 2008) reflected as a decrease in the EMG. Thus, it is important to study the hypothesis of enhancing CSI modeling by taking into account the EMG information together with the Ce. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Clinical data Data were collected from 27 dogs during routine surgery (orchiectomy or ovariectomy) with general anesthesia using propofol. The dogs were mixed breed, housed at Hospital Veterinário do Porto following standard pre-intervention conditions. The collected data were divided in two groups: G1 was used to develop the model (i.e., parameters estimation and validation), whereas G2 was used to test the model. The local ethics committee approved the procedures and an informed consent was provided to the owner. 2.1.1 Hemodynamic monitoring The propofol and fluid administration (sodium chloride 0.9%) were performed by a three way stopcock catheterized in the cephalic vein. An infusion pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was used for the sodium chloride 0.9% administration at a constant infusion rate of 10mlkg−1 h−1 during all the study period. The hemodynamic state of the patient was monitored, during all the anesthesia procedure, using a S/5 Datex anesthesia monitor (S/5 Datex-Ohmeda; Helsinki, Finland), namely monitoring blood pressure, lead II ECG and heart rate. Blood pressure was measured non-invasively on the posterior left foot using repeated measurements (oscillometric method): each measurement was done immediately after the preceding one (Datex S/5 “STAT” mode). 2.1.2 Data acquisition During each intervention, simultaneous measurements of propofol infusion rate r(t), CSI(t), and EMG(t) were recorded on a 5s time basis. Fig. 1 shows that an increase in the propofol infusion rate, r(t), produces an increase in Ce(t) and a simultaneous decrease in both CSI(t) and EMG(t), which is in accordance with propofol physiological effect. Propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg, Germany) was administered using a syringe pump (Asena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) programmed to allow an infusion rate r ⩽600mlh−1. RugLoop II® software was used to drive the syringe pump and store the data acquired by the Cerebral State Monitor® (CSM, Danmeter A/S). The CSM sensors are three single adhesives electrodes that were adapted for animal use. The wire link button was adapted to alligator’s clamps, which were then clipped to the dog’s head skin, over the head middle line (positive electrode placed in the frontopolar, negative electrode in the occipital and the reference electrode was placed in the pariental). This assembly was welded and protected with silicon (Bressan et al., 2007). The electrodes had impedance levels lower than 5kΩ, following manufacturer recommendations (Danmeter A/S, 2006). The CSI and EMG are simultaneously acquired by the CSM monitor using the same sensors. The monitor collects an electrical signal from the head and makes use of digital filtering to obtain two signals: the EEG (6–42Hz) and the EMG (75–85Hz). The CSI index is calculated using a multiparametric method based on fuzzy logic and EEG frequency parameters (Danmeter A/S, 2006; Jensen et al., 2006). The numerical scale of CSI ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no brain electrical activity and 100 corresponds to awake. The EMG is displayed as a numerical percentage (0–100 logarithmic), corresponding to the percentage of energy acquired in the 75–85Hz frequency band (Danmeter A/S, 2006). 2.1.3 Group 1 – train dataset Group 1 (G1) included 14 male animals, weighting between 18.8 and 35.0kg (25.3±5.3kg). The animals were premedicated 30min prior to the beginning of anesthesia to avoid animal stress (0.05mgkg−1 acepromazine IM, Vetoquinol, Univete). The anesthesia was divided into study and surgical periods: the study period did not have any external interference and was divided into induction and maintenance phases; the surgical period was characterized by external stimulus (e.g., incision, suture) and other drug administration (e.g., analgesic). In the induction phase, propofol was continuously administered at an infusion rate of 200mlh−1 until loss of corneal reflex (clinical criteria to determine a deep DoA). At this point, the dogs were intubated and mechanically ventilated with 100% oxygen in order to maintain an end-tidal CO2 between 35 and 45mmHg. In the maintenance phase, the propofol infusion rate was automatically adjusted so that Cp decreased to 3μgml−1 and after stepwise increased from 4 to 11μgml−1 (4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11μgml−1). The Cp was maintained during 5min in each step and the corneal reflex was evaluated. Hemodynamic variables (non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate and lead II ECG) were monitored during all the study. The surgical period began when corneal reflex was no longer present or hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure below 60mmHg) was verified, at this time a fentanyl bolus (5μgml−1) was administered. During this period, the propofol was adjusted based on clinical needs, i.e., the anesthesiologist evaluated the patient state by the monitor parameters and adjusted the drug concentrations accordingly. When the surgery finished, carprofen 4mgkg−1 SC and a single dose of morphine 0.4mgkg−1 SC were administered to the dogs, being monitored in the post-operative phase. 2.1.4 Group 2 – test dataset Group 2 (G2) was composed of 13 animals (9 female and 5 male), weighting between 6 and 45kg (20.0±11.7kg). The animals were premedicated 30min prior to the beginning of anesthesia to avoid animal stress (0.03mgkg−1 acepromazine IM, Vetoquinol, Univete and 0.5mgkg−1 morphine sulfate, Martindale Pharmaceuticals). In this protocol, the anesthesia was also divided into study and surgical periods. In the study period, propofol was administered via 6mgkg−1 bolus. After bolus administration, CSI was monitored until its minimum value being reached and return to a maximum value around 70 (scale 0–100) in order to avoid complete anesthetic recovery. At this time point, the normal surgical procedure began and depth of anesthesia was increased. During this period, propofol was adjusted based on clinical necessity, in order to maintain the patient stable during the entire procedure. During the study period, dogs were allowed to breath spontaneously via a facial mask connected to a breathing system, where 100% oxygen was administered. Hemodynamic variables (non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate and lead II ECG) were monitored during all study. A similar post-operative protocol was considered for the patients of this group. 2.2 CSI modeling The relation between the infusion rate r and the CSI (measure of effect) is represented in Fig. 2 . The model includes pharmacokinetic (Pk) and pharmacodynamic (Pd) blocks of propofol, and effect block model. After drug administration, the plasma concentration Cp is estimated with the Pk model, and the effect-site concentration Ce is estimated with the Pd model. Finally, the estimated Ce is the input of the effect model that describes CSI. Following sections detail each one of the model blocks. 2.2.1 Estimation of effect-site concentration (Ce) Ce is estimated assuming a Pk/Pd model, which translates what the body does to the drug (Pk) and what the drug does to the body (Pd) (Absalom and Struys, 2005). The Pk model is used to estimate Cp from infusion rate r (mlh−1) and the blood volume V 1 (ml), assuming a conventional three-compartmental model (Absalom and Struys, 2005). After its administration to the blood (compartment 1), the drug is rapidly distributed into the muscular tissues (compartment 2) and slowly distributed into the body fat tissues (compartment 3). These properties can be modeled by (1) Cp ( s ) = 1 V 1 · s 2 + ( k 31 + k 21 ) s + k 21 k 31 s 3 + p 1 s 2 + p 2 s + p 3 r ( s ) , p 1 = k 31 + k 21 + k 10 + k 13 + k 12 , p 2 = k 21 k 31 + k 10 k 21 + k 13 k 21 + k 10 k 31 + k 12 k 31 , p 3 = k 10 k 21 k 31 , where kij (min−1) is the transfer rate between the compartments i and j (i,j =1,2,3, i ≠ j). The parameter k 10 (min−1) is the elimination rate from the blood. The parameter V 1 (V 1 = Vc*wt) represents the blood volume, where Vc is the volume of central compartment per kg and wt is the dog’s weight in kg. In this work, the parameters in Eq. (1) are set to Vc =780mlkg−1, k 10 =0.07min−1, k 12 =0.0365min−1, k 21 =0.0312min−1, k 13 =0.0049min−1, and k 31 =0.0011min−1, following the study of Beths et al. (2001). The Pd model is used to estimate Ce from Cp as (2) Ce ( s ) = 1 1 k e 0 s + 1 Cp ( s ) , where ke 0 (min−1) is the elimination rate of the drug at the effect compartment and represents the delay between Cp and Ce. In this work, ke 0 =0.7230min−1 as detailed in Brás et al. (2009). Briefly, this parameter was estimated using the Time-to-Peak method, i.e., calculating the ke 0 based on the average time between the beginning of the bolus and the maximum CSI effect. 2.2.2 CSI modeling with the Hill equation (sigmoid) The Hill model, that allows to estimate CSI from Ce, is given by (3) CSI ^ t = CSI 0 + ( CSI 0 - CSI max ) Ce t γ Ce t γ + EC 50 γ , where CSImax is the CSI at maximum drug effect (i.e., the minimum CSI value), CSI0 is the CSI at no drug, EC50 is the effect-site concentration that produces 50% of the maximum effect, and γ is the Hill parameter that represents the steepness of drug effect around 50%. For each dog’s data, the Hill equation parameters were identified using nonlinear least squares (De Smet et al., 2007). The average parameters were used in a fixed parameter model. 2.2.3 CSI modeling with fuzzy logic In this work, the model output is z =CSI, while the inputs are x 1 = EMG and x 2 = Ce (see Fig. 2). Considering a Sugeno fuzzy logic model given two inputs x 1 and x 2, a typical fuzzy rule i (i =1,2, …, N) has the form: If x 1 ∈ Fi (x 1) and x 2 ∈ Fi (x 2),then output is (4) z i = a i x 1 + b i x 2 + c i , where F 1 i (x 1) and F 2 i (x 2) are the fuzzy sets and ai , bi , ci are constants. The zi of each rule is weighted by the firing strength wi of the rule i, and j refers to the inputs (in this case n =2 inputs), (5) w i = ∏ j = 1 n Γ F j i x j , where Γ F j i is a Gaussian membership function defined by its center μi and standard deviation σi (Angelov, 2002). The final output of the system z ˆ is the weighted average of all zi , computed as (6) z ˆ = ∑ i = 1 N w i z i ∑ i = 1 N w i , The parameters of the model (a, b, c, μ, σ) for each rule (i) were estimated using Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), combined with backpropagation and least squares minimization (hybrid method) (Jang, 1993). In this work, the initial μ and σ estimates could be obtained either from grid partition or subtractive clustering. In the grid partition method, the domain of the antecedent variables is divided into equidistant and identically shaped membership functions. In the subtractive clustering method, the antecedent domain is divided in clusters that identify conveniently the dataset. In this method, the radius σ is defined a priori as a value between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to the data range (Chiu, 1997). The initial radius σ is chosen from the set {0, 0.05, …, 1} as the radius that allows to obtain the highest performance after ANFIS procedure. 2.3 Statistical analysis The performance of the models is evaluated in terms of the mean absolute error and median bias for each record. The error is obtained from (7) error = 1 m ∑ t = 1 m | CSI ( t ) - CSI ( t ) ^ | , where m is the length of CSI in a recording, CSI ^ is the estimate of CSI as provided by a model, and t denotes time. The bias is obtained as (8) mbias = median ( CSI ( t ) - CSI ( t ) ^ ) , In this work, the model error was also studied regarding dispersion measures of Ce and EMG. For each record, the standard deviation of Ce was evaluated. The measure of EMG dispersion considered only the EMG values above 40%, i.e., (9) std 40 = 1 k - 1 ∑ t = 1 m I ( EMG ( t ) > 40 ) ( EMG ( t ) - 0 ) 2 . where I(A) is the indicator function of the set A and k is the number of EMG values expressing high activity, typically above 40%, in the recording of length m. The statistical analysis was carried out using nonparametric ANOVA, with significance level p <0.05 (Kruskal–Wallis for independent samples and Wilcoxon signed-rank for paired samples). The Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. 3 Results The parameters of the models were identified in the study period of G1 protocol, and validated in the study period of G2 protocol. Validation in a different group than the one used for model identification has the purpose of evaluating the model sensitivity to different anesthetic protocols. Additionally, the models are compared in the surgical period of G1 and G2 protocols, thus testing the models in a different surgery phase. The parameters of the Hill equation were identified using the methods described in Section 2.2.2 and data from the G1 study period. The resulting average parameters were EC50 =6.62±3.70μgml−1, γ =2.00±0.00, CSI0 =99.00±0.00 and CSImax =3.02±7.52 (being in accordance with previously reported results (De Smet et al., 2007)). The parameter CSImax, i.e., the CSI value at maximum drug effect, exhibited a large standard deviation, which evidences the large variability of individual responses to the same experimental protocol. As presented in Table 1 , the fuzzy logic structure that presented the lowest modeling error considered subtractive clustering and 4 rules, corresponding to 4 membership functions. Still, there were no significant differences between the fuzzy logic models for the different structures. After the ANFIS procedure, the model rules are defined as a linear combination between EMG and Ce. The model parameters are given in Table 2 and its corresponding membership functions are presented in Fig. 3 . As an example, the first rule is defined using Eq. (4) and the parameters in Table 2 as z 1 = 0.805 EMG + 2.198 Ce + 5.445 . The rule is then weighted according to Eq. (5) by w 1 = Γ F EMG 1 ( EMG ) × Γ F Ce 1 ( Ce ) , where Γ F EMG 1 is a Gaussian density with μ 1 =83.001 and σ 1 =25.228, and Γ F Ce 1 is a Gaussian density with μ 1 = 4.162 and σ 1 =4.303. The final output CSI ^ is the weighted average of all z i , i =1,2,3,4, according to Eq. (6). Fig. 4 (a) shows the output CSI ^ as a grid around the data, where it can be observed that the model follows adequately the experimental data. The new model provides the lowest modeled CSI values for the lowest Ce values (Fig. 4(a)). However, the lowest Ce values are associated with high EEG activity, once increasing concentrations of hypnotics induces EEG depression. In fact, it is possible to observe from Fig. 4(b) a shift of the model estimates towards the highest EMG values and the lowest Ce values for the highest CSI values. This result indicates that in the presence of low Ce values, the EMG is the variable with more importance in the CSI modeling. The comparison between the new CSI model and the Hill model has to consider that existing differences in performance can be due to differences in the model structure and/or the different inputs. The methodological changes are evaluated comparing the Hill model with the fuzzy model with single input Ce. The impact of the EMG in CSI modeling could not be assessed from the two inputs model, since Ce and EMG are expected to be correlated. This is because the administration of propofol tends to suppress the EMG activity (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007), which was corroborated in G1 protocol, with 9/14 dogs exhibiting a Ce and EMG correlation larger than −0.6. In this way, a fuzzy models with Ce and EMG as only inputs were additionally considered in order to quantify the impact of those variables in the CSI model. These models were estimated following the procedures described in Section 2.2.3 with n =1. As outlined in Table 3 , the CSI model with inputs Ce and EMG is designated as model B, whereas the CSI models with single input Ce or EMG are denoted as models A or C, respectively. Table 4 presents the modeling errors for different protocols and surgical phases. Table 5 resumes the results from a statistical comparison between the models’ errors evaluated in the study period. In the table diagonal, it is reported the comparison for the same model in different groups; in the upper triangle, it is presented the comparison between different models in G1 data; finally in the down triangle, it is the analysis concerning the G2 data. In protocol G1, there were no statistically significant differences in performance between Hill model and model A, indicating that there was no impact of replacing the model structure for CSI modeling. Also in protocol G1, model B achieved lower modeling errors in comparison with both Hill and A model (p =0.012 and p =0.024 respectively, Fig. 5 (a), evidencing the importance of the EMG variable in CSI model. Our results indicate that the difference error(A)−error(B) is highly correlated with EMG standard deviation measured by std40 (R =0.71, p <0.005, Fig. 5(b). The positive correlation indicates that model B over-performs model A with increased EMG activity. Actually, the value 61.59 for std40 corresponds to equal performance for the two models, for std40 values higher than 61.59 the model B over-performs the model A. Finally, there was no significant difference in performance between model C and B (p >0.1), corroborating that EMG is an important variable in the CSI model. Regarding protocol G2, no significant differences were found between the performances of the models. The models were also compared in the surgical period (Table 6 ), evidencing no pairwise significant differences either in protocol G1 or G2. However, when each model’s performance was compared for different protocols (diagonal in Table 6), models B and C performed better in protocol G2 data rather than G1 (p <0.05). Finally, the bias of each model in each protocol/condition was estimated according to Eq. (7). Statistical analysis indicated that all confidence intervals over the median bias include the value 0 (p <0.05), therefore the hypothesis of unbiased CSI modeling could not be rejected. 4 Discussion and conclusions In this work, a novel approach to CSI modeling is applied to veterinarian anesthesia. DoA indices are traditionally modeled using the Hill equation and considering Ce as the only input of the system (Holford and Sheiner, 1982; Tzabazis et al., 2004; Guarracino et al., 2005; De Smet et al., 2007; Ionescu et al., 2008). However, in protocol G1 the correlation between Hill model residuals ( CSI - CSI ^ ) , Eq. (3)) and EMG is found to be significant for all dogs (p <0.01 for 14/14 dogs). Also, the CSI and EMG correlation is found to be positive for all cases, exceeding 0.6 in 13/14 dogs. These results in the experimental data point out that the EMG should be an input of the CSI model, in addition to Ce. The model C residuals are found to be significantly correlated with Ce in 13/14 dogs (p <0.01), indicating that the Ce should not be discarded from the CSI model. These evidences found in the experimental data suggest the use of model B in CSI modeling, i.e., combining fuzzy logic approach with inputs Ce and EMG. Regarding model B structure, three membership functions covered the EMG range of values, indicating that the system is more sensitive to variations in EMG values (Fig. 3). On the contrary, the Ce membership functions are overlapped, suggesting that the system does not fully exploit the Ce domain information. Model B follows adequately the real data (Fig. 4(a)). Nevertheless, the extrapolation of this model can cause misleading interpretations, because it is expected that the largest CSI values are associated with the lowest Ce values (Jensen et al., 2006). As a matter of fact, the experimental data plotted in Fig. 4 associate the largest CSI values with Ce values near 0 and EMG values near 100. This result is in accordance with the expected interpretation because large CSI values indicate full electroencephalographic and electromyographic activity. This shift of the highest CSI values towards the lowest Ce and highest EMG values, indicates that higher CSI values are more associated with EMG rather than with Ce (Fig. 4(b)). The new model B is also compared with the traditional Hill model. Models A and C are additionally considered to explore existing differences due to methodology and/or the different inputs (Table 3). The results in the study period indicate that there is no loss of performance when the Hill model is replaced by the fuzzy logic structure (Hill versus A, p =0.288). Model B exhibits significantly lower modeling errors than model A (p =0.024) and similar performance in comparison with model C (p =0.948). Finally, the performance of model B (or C) increases in comparison with model A and Hill for increasing EMG changes (p <0.005), indicating that the EMG-based models better capture CSI changes in a recording. The methods are also compared for two different administration protocols: G1 with a constant infusion rate and Cp targets, and G2 via bolus. Traditionally, the propofol is administered by bolus, although with the introduction of automatic syringe pumps in clinical practice, the drug is nowadays more often administered using constant infusions or Cp/Ce targets. Bennett et al. (1998) point out the benefits of constant infusion (G1) versus bolus (G2) administration, e.g., the increase in the hemodynamic stability. The results in Table 5 indicate that Hill and model A follow better data from G2 protocol than the data from G1 protocol, as the modeling error increased significantly in G1 data (p <0.05). This is an expected result because protocol G1 was designed with continuous propofol administration while Hill-based CSI model assumes a sigmoidal CSI/Ce relation, adapted for protocols designed with bolus propofol administration, as G2. The new model B is found to exhibit similar performances in both protocols (G1 versus G2, p =0.145), and similar to that of the Hill and model A in protocol G2 (B versus Hill p =0.522, B versus A p =0.234). These results pointed out advantages of CSI model B over Hill model, evidencing that Hill model may not be suitable for non-bolus protocols, while model B exhibits a comparable response in different types of protocols. In the safer continuous infusion protocol (Bennett et al., 1998), model B is found to exhibit the lowest median modeling error in comparison with the other models (Table 4). In the surgical period, only models B and C achieved a better performance for protocol G2 than for G1 (Table 6). In both protocols, the propofol is administrated according to clinical necessity, but there are important differences in the experimental data, which may explain the better performance of the EMG based models in protocol G2. In fact, the dogs in protocol G1 received more propofol during the study period than those of protocol G2 and, therefore, it is expected that the EMG would be more suppressed in Surgery period for the dogs in protocol G1. The results indicated that the better performance of model B in protocol G2 than in G1, is significantly correlated with a decrease in the standard deviation of Ce and an increase in EMG standard deviation (Eq. (9)), G2 versus G1. In the surgical period, Ce is almost constant while EMG is more variable, once there is stimulus that affects the EMG activity. Therefore, EMG tends to provide more useful information to CSI model than Ce. The better performance of model B in comparison with Hill model is found to be directly related with the increase of EMG activity. However, the EMG may be suppressed during surgery, either spontaneously or by the administration of muscle relaxants. In such cases, our results indicated that model B maintains its performance comparing to the Hill model (Tables 5 and 6). The improved performance with model B is probably a consequence of the limitations associated to using a human DoA monitor in dogs. The CSI and EMG are calculated by band pass filtering of an electric activity signal, collected by sensors placed in the head. In the head, both muscular and cerebral electrical activities are present. However, dogs are expected to exhibit EEG activity of higher frequencies in comparison with humans (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007), which leads to a shift of EEG frequencies in dogs towards the EMG frequency band. This evidence suggests a more pronounced spectral overlap between EEG and EMG, and the possibility that the acquired “EMG” is in fact a mixture of high frequency EEG and electromyographic activity (Bonhomme and Hans, 2007; Ekman et al., 2007). In conclusion, this study suggests that the cutoff frequency to distinguish EEG and EMG set in the human CSM monitor may not be suitable for monitoring depth of anesthesia in dogs. The CSI performance in dogs can be improved by introducing the input EMG to the CSI model. These improvements are related to the changes in muscular activity induced by propofol, which can be quantified by a measure of EMG dispersion, such as std40, associated to a probable more pronounced spectral overlap between EEG and EMG in dogs. Overall, this work shows that the CSI modeling in dogs can be improved using the current human anesthesia set-up, once the EMG signal is acquired simultaneously with the CSI index. However, it does not invalidate the search of new indices more suitable to use in dog’s anesthesia.

The results indicate that fuzzy models exhibit a similar performance in both conditions, and their performance is significantly higher with real data than with surrogate data.

        "doc_abstract": "Cerebral State Index (CSI) is a measure of depth of anesthesia (DoA) developed for humans, which is traditionally modeled with the Hill equation and the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce). The CSI has been studied in dogs and showed several limitations related to the interpretation of EEG data. Nevertheless, the CSI has a lot of potential for DoA monitoring in dogs, it just needs to be adjusted for this species. In this work, an adapted CSI model is presented for dogs considering a) both Ce and EMG as inputs and b) a fuzzy logic structure with parameters optimized using the ANFIS method. The new model is compared with traditional Hill model using data from dogs in routine surgery. The results showed no significant impact in the model performance with the change of model structure (Fuzzy instead of Hill). The residuals of the Hill model were significantly correlated with the EMG, indicating that the latter should be considered in the model. In fact, the EMG introduction in CSI model significantly decreased the modeling error: 11.8 [8.6; 15.2] (fuzzy logic) versus 20.9 [16.4; 29.0] (Hill). This work shows that CSI modeling in dogs can be improved using the current human anesthesia set-up, once the EMG signal is acquired simultaneously with the CSI index. However, it does not invalidate the search of new DoA indices more adjusted to use in dog's anesthesia. © 2011 IEEE.",

Quantile regression (QR) is a more robust procedure than OLS and allows a more complete characterization of the data, by estimating conditional functions for different quantiles of interest. In this work, OLS and QR for BRS estimation are compared regarding slope estimates and dispersion. The EuroBaVar results indicate that OLS slope and QR slopes at different quantiles do not exhibit significant differences. Also, OLS and QR slopes require similar number of beats to achieve a given BRS precision in stationary recordings. Finally, BRS estimated with OLS exhibit relative dispersion lower than 10% and 5% when computed from stationary recordings of approximately 3 and 9 minutes length, respectively.",

BEs can be either of short or of long length, so they are likely to be associated with fast/parasympathetic as well as with slow/sympathetic ANS modulations. Under sympathetic inhibition, LF power in Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA) decreases and HF power dominates. Therefore, it is suggested that LF and HF powers of MSNA are related with sympathetic neural excitation and inhibition, respectively. In this work, MSNA powers are associated with BRS from short/long BEs, defined from a cutoff length estimated from the respiratory frequency of each subject. The results indicate that BRS from short(long) BEs are correlated with HF(LF), while not significantly correlated with LF(HF) powers. Therefore, short and long BEs may carry differentinformation on ANS modulations in baroreflex regulation.",

        "doc_abstract": "In patients with hypertension, β blockade decreases muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; micrographic technique) expressed in burst frequency (burst/min) but does not affect MSNA expressed in burst incidence (burst/100 heart beats), because reductions in blood pressure (BP) upon each diastole continue to deactivate the arterial baroreceptors, but at a slower heart rate (HR). We studied the effects of oral β blockade on MSNA and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in normal participants. Bisoprolol (5 mg, 1 week) was administered in 10 healthy young adults, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study design. The beat-to-beat mean RR interval (RR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) series were analyzed by power spectral analysis and power computation over the very low frequency (VLF), low frequency, and high frequency (HF) bands. Baroreflex sensitivity was computed from SBP and RR cross-analysis, using time and frequency domain methods. Bisoprolol increased RR (P <.0005), decreased mean SBP and diastolic blood pressure values (P <.01), did not change the SBP and RR powers, except for RR power in VLF (P <.02) and SBP power in HF (P <.03). The MSNA variability (P >.13) and respiratory pattern (P =.84) did not change from placebo to bisoprolol condition. The bisoprolol-induced bradycardia was associated with higher burst/100 heart beats (P <.05) and bisoprolol did not affect burst/min (P =.80). Time domain BRS estimates were increased after bisoprolol (P <.05), while frequency domain ones did not change (P >.1). Oral bisoprolol induces differential effects on sympathetic burst frequency and incidence in normal participants. Peripheral sympathetic outflow over time is preserved as a result of an increased burst incidence, in the presence of a slower HR. Unchanged BP and HR and MSNA variability suggests that the larger burst incidence is not due to sympathetic activation.",

The BRS is estimated by the slope between systolic blood pressure and RR interval values in baroreflex sequences (BSs) and an overall estimate is obtained by slope averaging. However, only 25% of all beats are in BSs with 60% of those located in 3-beat length segments. Also, in cases of BSs absence (usually associated with poor BRS function), the BRS cannot be quantified. Here, baroreflex events (BEs) are introduced and used with global/total slope estimators to improve BRS assessment. The performance of the novel method is evaluated using the EuroBaVar dataset. The events technique benefits from a higher number of beats: 50% of all beats are in BEs with more than 70% exceeding 3-beat length. It always provides a BRS estimate, even when BSs cannot be identified. When BSs are available, estimates from BEs and BSs are highly correlated. The estimates from BEs for the cases without BSs are lower than the estimates for the remaining cases, indicating poorer BRS function. The events technique also offers superior ability to discriminate lying from standing position in the EuroBaVar dataset (23/23 versus 18/23 for the sequences technique). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The sequences technique is frequently used for time domain assessment of the arterial-cardiac baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS). The BRS is estimated by the slope between systolic blood pressure and RR interval values in baroreflex sequences (BSs) and an overall estimate is obtained by slope averaging. However, only 25% of all beats are in BSs with 60% of those located in 3-beat length segments. Also, in cases of BSs absence (usually associated with poor BRS function), the BRS cannot be quantified. Here, baroreflex events (BEs) are introduced and used with global/total slope estimators to improve BRS assessment. The performance of the novel method is evaluated using the EuroBaVar dataset. The events technique benefits from a higher number of beats: 50% of all beats are in BEs with more than 70% exceeding 3-beat length. It always provides a BRS estimate, even when BSs cannot be identified. When BSs are available, estimates from BEs and BSs are highly correlated. The estimates from BEs for the cases without BSs are lower than the estimates for the remaining cases, indicating poorer BRS function. The events technique also offers superior ability to discriminate lying from standing position in the EuroBaVar dataset (23/23 versus 18/23 for the sequences technique). Keywords Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity Heart rate and blood pressure variability Sequences BRS Events BRS EuroBaVar 1 Introduction It is currently accepted that the joint analysis of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and RR interval series allows the assessment of the arterial-cardiac baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS), either using time or frequency domain methods [1]. The sequences technique is a frequently used time domain method for spontaneous BRS estimation, thanks to its ease of implementation [2]. This method is based on the identification of baroreflex sequences (BSs) and linear regression over the corresponding SBP and RR values. An overall estimate is obtained by averaging the slope estimates from all BSs identified in a record. In spite of its simplicity, this technique sometimes fails to provide an estimate for low BRS patients, depending of the parameters used. As a result, this method is considered by some authors to have limited value for the BRS evaluation/quantification in autonomic dysfunction cases [3], which are the crucial cases to identify. Therefore, performance improvements that preserve simplicity are needed. The sequences technique was first used in sino-aortic denervated cats [4,5]. The spontaneous BSs appeared to reflect baroreflex mechanisms as their number (and mean slope) was drastically reduced after denervation. Studies in humans confirmed the existence of such BSs and reported similar results in subjects with poor BRS function [6]. In practice, several thresholds are imposed for BSs identification and no consensual opinion about their values can be found in the literature; slight modifications in threshold values can change the number of BSs and the BRS estimate [7]. The values derived for cats are most likely non-optimal for humans. Moreover, the elimination of certain thresholds has also been suggested [7,8]. In normal cases, the overall number of beats in BSs is approximately one fourth of the total number of beats [5] and, consequently, a large part of the data is discarded from BRS analysis. More than half of the BSs have 3-beat length [9], implying that the BRS estimate is more likely to be influenced by outlier values. In cases of BRS dysfunction, the number of BSs is further reduced so that the slope estimate will exhibit higher variance. In cases of BSs being unavailable, the BRS cannot be quantified. The validity of BRS estimates obtained from short and few SBP–RR segments remains to be addressed [10]. Improvements on time domain BRS assessment have been proposed with the ‘xBRS’ estimate [8]. Briefly, the regression is performed over 10 s windows of the SBP and RR series resampled at 1 Hz, considering the SBP–RR delay that maximizes their cross-correlation (up to 5s). The BRS estimates are accepted if positive valued and statistically significant at the probability 0.01. Finally, the BRS estimate from an entire recording is obtained by geometric averaging of the local estimates. As pointed out in [11], this method provides more BRS estimates than the sequences technique because it allows a non-constant SBP–RR delay. However, as the BRS is estimated in relatively long time windows, different effects such as arterial baroreceptor stimulation and deactivation can occur and, therefore, cannot be separated. In this work, a new criterion for beat-to-beat SBP–RR segmentation is introduced. It consists of the identification of high SBP–RR correlation segments, here referred as baroreflex events (BEs), which are not constrained to be of constant length. Alternative BRS estimators combined with BEs are proposed to improve time domain BRS assessment in normal conditions and to allow its quantification in cases of BS absence. The methods for time domain BRS estimation are described in Section 2. The experimental data used in this work is described in Section 3. The results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. 2 Methods BRS analysis is performed over SBP and RR series, denoted x SBP ( n ) and x RR ( n ) respectively, with n = 1 , 2 , … , N max ⁡ indicating beat number. The analysis is considered with a beat lag of τ = 1 , i.e., x SBP ( n − 1 ) is paired with x RR ( n ) [5]. The methods are based on 2 steps: first the identification of baroreflex related segments (sequences or events) and then BRS estimation from SBP–RR slope. The sequences technique is based on BSs identification and on the average of the slopes computed at each BS [2,5], here referred as local approach for slope estimation. The events technique, proposed in this work to improve BRS assessment, makes use of baroreflex events (BEs) and global/total slope estimators. 2.1 The sequences technique The threshold values used for BSs identification are summarized in Table 1 . The kth BS must have a minimum length in beats ( N k ≥ N min ⁡ ), a minimum x SBP and x RR beat-to-beat changes in the same direction ( Δ k SBP ≥ Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ k RR ≥ Δ min ⁡ RR ) and a minimum correlation between the x SBP and x RR values in BSs ( r k ≥ r min ⁡ ). Each identified BS k , k = 1 , 2 , … , K is characterized by N k pairs of values ( x SBP k , x RR k ) beginning at index n k , that is, x SBP k = [ x SBP ( n k − 1 ) x SBP ( n k ) ⋯ x SBP ( n k + N k − 2 ) ] x RR k = [ x RR ( n k ) x RR ( n k + 1 ) ⋯ x RR ( n k + N k − 1 ) ] . The local approach provides one BRS estimate (slope) from each baroreflex related segment. Formally, the BRS measure b k , associated to the kth segment, is estimated assuming the linear regression between x SBP k and x SBP k , i.e., (1) x RR k = b k x SBP k + c k 1 N k + ϵ k , k = 1 , 2 , … , K where ϵ k is a vector of residuals and 1 N k is a vector of ones with length N k . The parameters b k and c k are estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) minimization. Finally, an overall estimator is obtained from the mean of the K local slopes (2) B L,O = 1 K ∑ k = 1 K b k . 2.2 The events technique The new criterion for SBP–RR segmentation consists of the identification of segments that exhibit positive and high correlation between the x SBP and x RR values. That is, for the identification of each baroreflex event BE k only the thresholds N min ⁡ and r min ⁡ are enforced, as pointed out in Table 1. Since no minimum values for Δ k SBP and Δ k RR are required, x SBP and x RR may not be consecutively increasing or decreasing on a beat-to-beat basis as in BSs. Fig. 1 displays x SBP and x RR in BSs and BEs identified in a record, illustrating that BEs are not necessarily simultaneous x SBP and x RR ramps over time as BSs. Also, it can be observed that BEs can achieve a longer length than BSs and that x SBP and x RR in BEs exhibit more variability as a consequence of less restrictive identification thresholds. 2.2.1 Global approach for slope estimation The global approach is based on a global regression slope over the local mean detrended baroreflex related segments [12]. The kth local mean detrended segment ( d SBP k , d RR k ) is obtained from the original segment ( x SBP k , x RR k ) by (3) d SBP k = x SBP k − x ¯ SBP k 1 N k and d RR k = x RR k − x ¯ RR k 1 N k , where x ¯ SBP k and x ¯ RR k represent the mean value of x SBP k and x SBP k , respectively, i.e, (4) x ¯ SBP k = 1 N k ∑ i = 1 N k x SBP k ( i ) and x ¯ RR k = 1 N k ∑ i = 1 N k x RR k ( i ) . Local mean detrending allows the correction of the differences in x SBP k and x RR k baselines, emphasizing their fluctuations around their local mean value. The detrended pairs of values can be represented in a dispersion diagram with d SBP k displayed against d RR k as in Fig. 2(a) and (b). A global BRS measure B G,O can be considered as the slope obtained from the mean detrended values, (5) d RR = B G,O d SBP + ϵ , where d SBP = [ d SBP 1 ⋯ d SBP K ] , d RR = [ d RR 1 ⋯ d RR K ] and ϵ is a vector of residuals. The parameter B G,O is estimated by OLS minimization. 2.2.2 Total approach for slope estimation The total approach is a robust version of the global approach, consisting of an outlier rejection rule combined with the slope estimation in (5) using total least squares (TLS) minimization [13]. In linear regression, the OLS method attributes all errors to the dependent variable and the solution minimizes the sum of squared vertical direction errors. On the other hand, the TLS method minimizes the sum of squared orthogonal direction errors, accounting for errors in both the dependent and the independent variables [14]. Before TLS slope estimation, outlier segments are removed from BRS analysis. The influence of the kth segment is evaluated by f k , this being the ratio between the TLS slope estimated when the kth segment is omitted from BRS analysis and the TLS slope estimated when all segments are used for BRS analysis. A value of f k near 1 indicates no excessive influence of that segment in the BRS estimation. The kth segment is an outlier if f k exceeds the median value more than twice the median absolute deviation (MAD) divided by 0.6745 [15]. After the removal of outlier segments, the total slope B G,T is estimated with the remaining pairs ( d SBP, α , d RR, α ). The TLS approach is sensitive to scale changes in the data [14], meaning that a multiplicative factor in one of the variables will not produce a proportional slope. To deal with this shortcoming, d SBP, α and d RR, α must be normalized and to guarantee the same order of magnitude in d SBP, α and d RR, α errors, the correction factors are defined by the corresponding MAD values. The slope α is estimated using TLS minimization over the normalized values from (6) d RR, α MAD ( d RR, α ) = α d SBP, α MAD ( d SBP, α ) + ϵ α , where ϵ α is a vector of residuals and the total approach estimator is (7) B G,T = MAD ( d RR, α ) MAD ( d SBP, α ) α . Fig. 2(c) and (d) illustrate the dispersion of d SBP, α and d RR, α together with the corresponding total regression line. Comparing to Fig. 2(a) and (b), it can be observed that the identified outlier segments have their extreme points outside the mass center of the data. 3 Experimental data The performance of the methods is evaluated using the EuroBaVar dataset, available for the comparison of BRS estimation procedures [10]. This dataset has 46 paired records of spontaneous x SBP and x RR series, acquired from 21 subjects in lying (L) and standing (S) positions. The record lengths range from 553 to 1218 beats. Therefore, in order to set comparable results for all records, the BRS analysis was based on the first N max ⁡ = 512 beats. The dataset is non-homogenous: one subject is diabetic with evident cardiac autonomic neuropathy and another is recently heart transplanted, both classified as cardiac baroreflex failure patients by the Ewing score [10]. The remaining 19 subjects are 12 normotensive outpatients, 1 untreated hypertensive, 2 treated hypertensive and 4 healthy volunteers. In addition, replica records of two subjects were incorporated to test reproducibility. There is no information about the match of each subject to its corresponding records. 4 Results The methods were compared with respect to the variables given in Table 2 and their ability to discriminate L and S positions for each record. The upper index S or E was added to each variable according to its evaluation in BSs or BEs, e.g., N S and N E indicate the number of beats available for BRS analysis using BSs and BEs. 4.1 Sensitivity analysis of r min ⁡ Fig. 3 presents the distribution of the variables in Table 2, as a function of r min ⁡ . For BSs, all variables are constant for r min ⁡ < 0.8 , because the identified BSs are the same. This result indicates that the x SBP and x RR values in BSs present r min ⁡ > 0.8 . In median, N S is close to 128 of the 512 beats and N S / K S is lower than 4 beats/segment. The r S is very high, probably due to the small values of N S and N S / K S . For r min ⁡ > 0.8 , N S and K S decrease in the same proportion so that N S / K S is kept constant for all r min ⁡ values. The BSs that exhibit lower correlation are rejected for r min ⁡ > 0.8 , leading to higher r S values. For BEs, N E decreases and K E increases with increasing r min ⁡ . The ratio N E / K E decreases and tends to N min ⁡ = 3 , with r min ⁡ increasing to 1. Regarding the BRS estimates, B ˆ L,O E and B ˆ G,O E increase with increasing r min ⁡ , because BEs with lower x SBP − x RR correlation and slope are identified for lower r min ⁡ values. When r min ⁡ increases, these segments are more unlikely to be identified and B ˆ G,O E tends to B ˆ G,O S . As previously indicated, N E / K E decreases when r min ⁡ increases. The mean of the local slopes B ˆ L,O E is calculated from more segments of shorter length (and higher slope) and, therefore B ˆ L,O E increases for increasing r min ⁡ . The robust estimates B ˆ G,T E do not seem to be much affected by r min ⁡ , mainly due to the outlier rejection rule. Finally, as illustrated in Fig. 3(c), r E increases linearly with r min ⁡ , being approximately r min ⁡ for 0.2 < r min ⁡ < 0.8 . The four files without BSs (circles in Fig. 3) present the same trend in N E , N E / K E and B ˆ E as for the remaining files, although presenting lower values. Fig. 3(d) and (e) suggest that r min ⁡ = 0.8 for BEs identification is an optimum trade-off between N E and r E . Since N E decreases and r E increases when r min ⁡ increases, r min ⁡ can be set to a value that maximizes the product N E r E . Alternatively, the product N E ( r E ) 2 can be considered, once the squared correlation coefficient r 2 corresponds to the fraction of d RR variance accounted for the d SBP − d RR linear regression. 4.2 Number of beats/segments in BRS analysis Fig. 4 shows that N E is highly correlated with N S and is always higher than N S (Fig. 4(a)), because BEs are in larger numbers for most of the files (open circles in Fig. 4(b)) and BEs are longer segments segments than BSs. The files that present K S > K E (filled circles) are the files that present the highest N E and N S values and still satisfy N E > N S , because in these cases BEs are much longer than BSs. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the median of K and the number of EuroBaVar records (out of 46) as a function of N k (the segments length), evidencing that BEs are longer segments than BSs. For BSs, 12 records have one 6-beat BS and none present BSs longer than 8 beats, whereas 24 records have one 10-beat BE and 21 records one 15-beat BE. 4.3 BRS estimates and L from S discrimination Fig. 6(a) shows the empirical distribution of B ˆ . The B ˆ L,O E values are higher than B ˆ L,O S and show larger interindividual differences. With the use of the global/total approaches, B ˆ S and B ˆ E have similar distributions. The pairwise comparison between estimates from BSs corroborates that B ˆ L,O S > B ˆ G,O S [12], mainly due to the fact that the global approach emphasizes BSs with lower slopes. There are no significant statistical differences between the mean of paired B ˆ L,O S − B ˆ G,T S values and zero ( p > 0.7 ). The comparison between B ˆ G,O E and B ˆ G,T E with the traditional B ˆ L,O S evidences that B ˆ L,O S > B ˆ G,O E in 34/42 of the files, B ˆ G,T E > B ˆ L,O S in 25/42 of the files and B ˆ G,T E > B ˆ L,O S > B ˆ G,O E in 17/42 of the files. All approaches produce B ˆ S with pairwise correlations exceeding 0.97 and B ˆ E with pairwise correlations exceeding 0.8. The estimates B ˆ G,T S and B ˆ G,T E attained the highest correlation between estimates using BSs and BEs (0.94). BRS analysis based on BEs has also the capability of providing a BRS estimate when BSs cannot be identified. The 4 files without BSs correspond to the paired L and S evaluations of the 2 subjects (B005 and B010), in which neuropathy was evidenced by inadequate Heart Rate response to Ewing’s test. For these files, identified in Fig. 6(a) with the open circles, the B ˆ E values are lower than the 5th percentile of the BRS estimates empirical distribution of the remaining files. For the discrimination between L and S, it is expected that the L to S ratio of B ˆ ( R ˆ L S ) is above 1 [10]. As shown in Fig. 6(b) there is strong evidence that both the mean and median of R ˆ L S are above 1 for all approaches combined with BSs or BEs, being approximatly two times greater in L than in S. Of the 23 pairs of records, 21 present BSs in both positions and R ˆ L S from local/global/total approach is above 1 in 18/20/20 of the pairs, respectively. All 23 pairs present BEs, and R ˆ L S is above 1 in 20/23/23 of the pairs, respectively. The use of global/total approach combined with BEs is able to distinguish L from S also for the files without BSs, but not able to differentiate them from the remaining files. The results of the events technique are compared to those of the ‘xBRS’ estimate [8] in Table 3 . All techniques are able to differenciate L from S positions ( R ˆ L S > 1 ), with the B ˆ G,T E estimates achieving a higher R ˆ L S mean (better discrimination), with similar variability and lower amplitude range. Both B ˆ G,O E and B ˆ G,T E are able to distinguish L and S conditions for all subjects. 5 Discussion The thresholds minimum beat-to-beat changes ( Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ min ⁡ RR ) and minimum correlation ( r min ⁡ ) required for x SBP and x RR segmentation are set to increase the reliability of the identified BS being a segment clearly baroreflex related. In this way, there is an increased assurance that the corresponding slope is quantifying a real baroreflex effect. However, their use may also reduce the ability of providing an individual estimate, particularly if the thresholds values are very restrictive and/or the analyzed subject has poor BRS function. The simultaneous use of Δ min ⁡ SBP , Δ min ⁡ RR and r min ⁡ can be avoided [16]. In fact, x SBP − x RR segments satisfying restrictive Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ min ⁡ RR values present high x SBP − x RR correlation. The correlation is usually higher than r min ⁡ , suggesting that these 3 thresholds are redundant. This fact is in accordance with results in cats data [5], where it is reported that the correlation between x SBP and x RR value that fulfill Δ min ⁡ SBP = 1 mmHg and Δ min ⁡ RR = 4 ms exceeds 0.92; the authors state that this high correlation supports a true baroreflex nature of BSs rather than random coupling. The high correlation is clearly a consequence of BSs being chosen as to satisfy restrictive values on Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ min ⁡ RR . In the EuroBaVar data, 85% of the x SBP − x RR segments that fulfill N min ⁡ = 3 , Δ min ⁡ SBP = 1 and Δ min ⁡ RR = 4 also satisfy r min ⁡ = 0.92 . This percentage increases to 99% for r min ⁡ = 0.8 , either setting Δ min ⁡ RR = 4 or Δ min ⁡ RR = 5 ms. Removing Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ min ⁡ RR for x SBP and x RR segmentation (as in BEs), there are more beats available for the slope estimation in the files that present BSs. Also it enables to identify segments in cases of BSs absence and, therefore, it is possible to provide a BRS estimate. Consequently, it would be more adequate to remove Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ min ⁡ RR thresholds and only impose the r min ⁡ threshold. The results of the r min ⁡ sensitivity analysis show that r min ⁡ = 0.8 is an adequate value for BEs identification, achieving a trade-off between N E and r E and maximizing r E (see Fig. 3(c)–(e)). It is important to point out that both BSs and BEs are identified by imposing a r min ⁡ value, regardless of its statistical significance ( p r as the p-value for the null hypothesis of no correlation). If such a criterion was to be additionally considered, 60% of the BSs identified in the EuroBaVar files (representing 54% of the BSs beats) would not present statistically significant x SBP and x RR correlation (i.e., p r > 0.05 ). For BEs, the corresponding proportions would be 61% and 38%. The inclusion of non-significant segments can turn into a disadvantage if B L,O is used (either combined with BSs or BEs), but not if the events technique estimators ( B G,O E and B G,T E ) are used. With that inclusion, B ˆ L,O considers slopes estimated from non-significant segments to compute the average slope, whereas the events technique estimates are still based on data that presents r E close to 0.8 and, due to the large N E value, it is obviously statistically significant (see Fig. 3). The non-significant BEs are typically 3-beat segments that are located around the origin of the d SBP and d RR dispersion diagrams (as the ones in Fig. 2(b) and (d)). Therefore, these short segments have small weight in the global/total slope estimation: the correlation between the B ˆ G,O E and the B ˆ G,O computed from the segments identified by imposing r min ⁡ = 0.8 and p r ≤ 0.05 is 0.98 and their median paired differences is not significantly different from zero ( p > 0.35 ). Patients with a weak baroreflex response can be expected to present x SBP and x RR correlation lower than 0.8, although statistically significant. If the segments identification would be performed with r min ⁡ = 0 and p r ≤ 0.05 , r and N would be much lower than with BEs (for both dysfunction and normal cases) and, therefore, the ability of such method to provide an adequate BRS estimate would be diminished. As for the normal, the dysfunction cases present r E close to 0.8 (also statistically significant due to large N E ) and the expected lower x SBP and x RR correlation is reflected in shorter N E / K E , i.e., shorter segments of high correlation (see Fig. 3). A shorter length of BSs leads to a higher variance in the BRS estimate when the sequences technique is used (local approach with BSs), since each slope is typically estimated from 3 points. BRS estimation based on the local approach with BEs reduces the accuracy problem, because BEs are longer segments than BSs. This shortcoming can be further reduced if BEs are used together with global/total approach. First, with the global/total approach the slope is estimated from the overall number of x SBP − x RR pairs in all of the identified segments. Second, as BEs are longer segments and usually in higher number than BSs, the overall number of beats in BEs is higher than in BSs. Also, the stationarity of BRS over segments in this dataset (a priori setting of r min ⁡ = 0.8 leading to r close to 0.8) supports the use of global/total approach for BRS estimation, which implicitly assume stationarity. Regarding the BRS values, it was shown that local estimates from BEs are higher and present higher dispersion than local estimates from BSs. The higher dispersion in BEs estimates simply indicates that, in the EuroBaVar dataset (a heterogenous dataset), the inter-subject variability measured by BEs analysis is greater than the inter-subject variability measured by BSs analysis. These results can be explained by the weight of 3-beat BEs in the slopes averaging, once they present higher slopes than the 3-beat BSs (as a result of avoiding Δ min ⁡ SBP and Δ min ⁡ RR thresholds). This was corroborated by recalculating local estimates from BEs considering N min ⁡ = 4 and observing that the differences both in median and dispersion disappear. Concerning the global/total approach with N min ⁡ = 3 , the median and dispersion differences in the BSs/BEs estimates are smaller (see Fig. 6(a)). In general, local estimates are higher than global estimates (both with BSs and BEs) and there are no significant statistical differences between local and total estimates. All estimates present pairwise correlation with the sequences technique estimates exceeding 0.8. With the use of the global/total approaches, BRS estimates from BSs and BEs have similar distributions and the total approach presents the highest correlation between BSs and BEs estimates with no significant statistical differences. The fact that BRS estimates from BSs and BEs are correlated, though in the latter case obtained from a higher number of beats, indicates that both are measuring the same phenomenon but with a more visible expression in BEs. The absence of BSs in a record, and the impossibility to assess the BRS, is not synonymous to an absent BRS function, but rather a shortcoming of the sequences technique to provide a BRS estimate. In EuroBaVar recordings without BSs, the number of beats in BEs is around 200 out of 512 beats with r E exceeding 0.75. The corresponding BRS estimates are lower than the 5th percentile of the BRS estimates empirical distribution for the remaining files, therefore indicating a poorer BRS function of these subjects. The ratio R ˆ L S obtained from BEs allows the discrimination of L and S positions in all subjects, whether obtained with the global or the total approach. However, the median of the ratios is higher when the total approach is used. In general, the total approach is preferred since it is more robust than the global approach and can handle nonstationary data. It should be noticed that for the single purpose of L and S discrimination, simpler statistical measures over the whole x RR series can be considered. For example, the L to S ratio of x RR mean value (or any quartile) discriminates 22/23 of the cases and the L to S ratio of x RR maximum value (or minimum) discriminates 21/23 of the cases. The use of BEs in BRS analysis also allows L and S discrimination for the subjects without BSs and it is not possible to differentiate these cases from the remaining ones. The location of the ratio R ˆ L S for these files in separate tails of the overall distribution could be explained by the fact that the ratio of two small values is more sensitive to a small variation in one of the values. Another explanation could be the different origins of the baroreflex failure (one diabetic with cardiac neuropathy and another after heart transplantation). From this work, clinical interpretation studies facing pathological/control cases should be carried out in order to further investigate this behaviour. There has been debate about the meaning of BSs and the reasons why the SBP–RR analysis based on BSs reflects the BRS function [5,9]. It is reported that the parasympathetic modulation may be already active on the same RR interval or on the one immediately following a blood pressure change, while sympathetic modulation usually becomes apparent after 5–6 beats [9]. As displayed in Fig. 5, BSs are typically of 3-beat length, 12/46 of the records have 6-beat BSs and none present BSs longer than 8 beats. Therefore, BRS analysis from BSs mostly reflects the autonomic control of the heart through parasympathetic neural afferents [9]. The sympathetic arm of the ANS presents typically oscillations of lower frequency than the parasympathetic [9] and, therefore, longer x SBP and x RR data segments are needed to detect and quantify this modulation. As the events technique is able to provide long data segments, besides the short segments already identified by the sequences technique, BEs are more likely to capture the sympathetic modulation than BSs. Also, as BEs are not constrained to be of constant length (as in [8]), arterial baroreceptors stimulation and deactivation effects can be separable. Experimental studies making use of manoeuvers for the activation or inhibition parasympathetic/sympathetic modulations are now needed to clarify the physiological meaning of baroreflex events. 6 Conclusions In this work, the events technique is proposed to improve time domain BRS assessment. This novel technique consists of the joint use of baroreflex events (BEs) and global/total slope estimators. With the use of BEs instead of BSs, the BRS analysis benefits from more and longer segments of data, leading to a higher number of beats available for the slope estimation (more than 50% of all beats in BEs against 25% in BSs). Also, the use of BEs provides a BRS estimate for all subjects. If BSs are identified, BRS estimates from BEs and BSs are highly correlated. For the cases of BSs absence (usually associated with poor BRS function), BRS estimates based on BEs are lower than the 5th percentile of the remaining BRS estimates empirical distribution. Finally, the events technique provides a higher BRS estimates inter-subject variability, which allows to distinguish lying from standing positions in all subjects, including those without BSs (23/23 against 18/23 for the sequences technique).

The results corroborate that spontaneous and drug induced estimates are different although correlated. In particular, if BEs are used the differences and the correlation between the estimates is higher. No precision improvement is achieved if the BRS is estimated from drug induced data.

In normal conditions most of BSs have 3 beats length and the estimated slope is potentially inaccurate. Also, the number of beats in BSs is approximately 25% of the total number of beats, evidencing that a large part of the data is discarded from BRS analysis. In this work, global BRS estimators combined with baroreflex events (BEs) are proposed as a way to improve BRS assessment in normal conditions and to allow its quantification in cases of BS absence. The results in the EuroBaVar dataset showed that the number of beats in BEs gets up to 50% of the total, with correlation between the corresponding SBP and RR values close to 0.8. Also, BRS assessment based on global estimators combined with BEs distinguishes Lying from Standing positions in all the subjects of that dataset, including those without identified BSs.",

In a previous study, a global estimator was compared with the traditional estimator: global is less biased, presents lower variance and the use of SBPramps in BRS estimation, instead of BRSseqs, turns both estimators unbiased. In this work, the replacement of BRSseqs for SBPramps in BRS analysis is further evaluated. Also, it is introduced a robust global (total) approach and compared with the traditional and the global approaches. The results showed that BRS global estimator with BRSseqs has lower bias, lower variability and present increased power to discriminate between Lying and Standing situations in the EuroBaVar dataset. It is expected that the robust properties of the total estimator can be fully enhanced in clinical practice.",

A low-order linear autoregressive model allowed to separate and quantify the QTV fractions correlated and not correlated with HRV, estimating their power spectral density measures. Simulated series and artificial ECG signals were used to assess the performance of the methods, considering a respiratory-like electrical axis rotation effect and noise contamination with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from 30 to 10 dB. The errors found in the estimation of the QTV fraction related to HRV showed a nonrelevant performance decrease from automatic delineation. The joint performance of delineation plus variability analysis achieved less than 20% error in over 75% of cases for records presenting SNRs higher than 15 dB and QT standard deviation higher than 10 ms. The methods were also applied to real ECG records from healthy subjects where it was found a relevant QTV fraction not correlated with HRV (over 40% in 19 out of 23 segments analyzed), indicating that an important part of QTV is not linearly driven by HRV and may contain complementary information. © 2006 IEEE.",

Although a common used method, the sequences technique imposes the setting of several parameters to determine what is a valid baroreflex event and no consensual opinion about these parameters is found in the literature. The theory is overlooked, and linear regression over three values is the usual procedure. The methodology itself can be questionable and the estimator has not been clearly examined regarding its statistical properties, namely bias and variance. In this work, an alternative estimator that we have been using is evaluated and compared with the traditional approach, considering real and simulated data. The results obtained show that the proposed estimator is less biased and presents lower variance than the traditional approach. © 2005 IEEE.",
