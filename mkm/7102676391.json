Traditionally, the development of these skills is achieved with the help of several laboratorial facilities. Here, a full-stack model to help in this process is presented. This model includes the utilization of a set of tools that can be used to remotely access the available resources, thus creating an “online lab.” This “online lab” is of particular interest and usefulness in the current pandemic context and is of particular interest not only for students to have access to real hardware devices, thus developing their skills and knowledge, but also to professional teams collaborating in the development of IoT sensor devices.",

Internet of Things (IoT) technology may be used to contribute to increasing the degree of security of these people in their own homes, in a much more discreet and non-intrusive way than the typical commercially available systems, providing real-time data about the status of these people to their family members or caretakers. In this article, a non-intrusive IoT-based real-time alert system to be used by elderly people is proposed, using simple and low-cost “of the shelf” electronic components. It is also intended that this solution can integrate other monitoring devices already available on the market, such as bracelets, video cameras, robots, among others. Both laboratorial and house-hold tests have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of the system.",

All rights reserved.The study analyzed several instruments of the master-integrated course in Electrical and Computer Engineering at a Portuguese Public University. The institutional drivers responsible for adopting new methodologies in the course were evaluated. A case study was carried out with a qualitative approach based on mixed methods: a statistical analysis applied to textual corpus and complemented by content analysis. As a result, two classes of content analysis emerged: skills and knowledge expected from students; and aspects of training in Electrical Engineering and the study cycle. Seven drivers were identified for the adoption of new methodologies in the course, based on the theories of diffusion of innovation and institutional theory: training, development, competence, study cycle, new, technology, and UC. Each of these drivers has its outcomes, 16 in total, which shows the effects perceived by the teachers, course coordinators and evaluators.",

The analysis was based on the perception of the course coordinators. Triangulation between multiple methodologies and different methods of analysis was used, combining lexical analysis, analysis of keywords and content analysis. Course coordinators were interviewed at three universities in Portugal and Brazil. In the content analysis, two categories emerged: the coordinators' perception of non-traditional methodologies, and the perception of software tools as didactic resources. The initiatives using non-traditional teaching processes and methodologies were reduced and punctual, with individual actions by teachers and not of educational standards discussed and institutionalized. The precariousness of laboratory infrastructure and software licenses was a common report.",

In addition to supporting the typical needs of distance learning/education (e.g., e-learning), it is also intended that the proposed system complements the traditional classroom-based teaching. This model will have two modules: the physical/infrastructural module and the policies/practices module. While the physical module will have all the infrastructure services associated with educational practices, such as the e-learning platform, the policy module will include institutional policies and rules in the creation, development, practice and management of courses, equipment and physical spaces, such as exam rooms. In line with these, UTAD has come to recognize that e-learning should be part of its strategy for its training offer and, consequently, is being adopting new policies, namely through the signing of protocols with other institutions with more experience using e-learning. As such, a review of other models and systems that have been successfully implemented in other international reference universities will also be briefly presented here. The courses implemented so far, and the results achieved, are also presented and commented.",

It is composed of two components: the hardware component (e.g., Android Tablet); and the software component. The software component as two modules: the server and the client. A teacher chooses what exercises/games a child should do directly in the Android table or using the server, from the existing ones in the system. A child does the exercises/games by logging into the system in the Android Tablet. Automatic feedback about the correctness of the answers is provided by the system. Data (number of tries, time spent, etc.) are automatically grabbed and processed to be presented to the teachers and parents. Registered parents can see the results and follow their children' s “academic life”, by logging into the server side of the system. We found a significant improvement in the development of handwriting skills in the children throughout the academic year, and improvements were also more present when comparing children who had have contact with the system with children who did not have this contact. Educators, children, School Boards, City Town Hall and the Educational Community are unanimous in stating that the implementation of this system was a real success.",

A system to support the teaching and learning of handwriting skills is proposed. It is composed of two components: the hardware component (e.g., Android Tablet); and the software component. The software component as two modules: the server and the client. A teacher chooses what exercises/games a child should do directly in the Android table or using the server, from the existing ones in the system. A child does the exercises/games by logging into the system in the Android Tablet. Automatic feedback about the correctness of the answers is provided by the system. Data (number of tries, time spent, etc.) are automatically grabbed and processed to be presented to the teachers and parents. Registered parents can see the results and follow their children' s “academic life”, by logging into the server side of the system. We found a significant improvement in the development of handwriting skills in the children throughout the academic year, and improvements were also more present when comparing children who had have contact with the system with children who did not have this contact. Educators, children, School Boards, City Town Hall and the Educational Community are unanimous in stating that the implementation of this system was a real success.

Proponents of sociocultural theory claim that learning is primarily a social process mediated through interactions using tools (Vygotsky, 1978; Wertsch, 1992). According to Vygotsky, mediation occurs through the use of ‘semiotic’ and ‘material’ tools. The semiotic tools include symbols, signs, and spoken languages. Material tools include such items as pens, spoons, and particularly networked computers. These tools do not simply facilitate the set of activities that might take place, but they fundamentally shape and define the type of activities that might be developed (Wertsch, 1992; Berge et al., 2019). Seymour Papert proposed the use of tools, particularly the computer—“a mighty education tool”, in helping in the process of construction of knowledge (given rise to the “constructionist” theory), adapting the beginnings of the cognitive constructivism of Jean Piaget in order to a better use of technology (Papert, 1980). In order to become more accurate in their work, both in reading problems and in working out solutions, kindergarten and primary students need more practice to reinforce what they are learning, a process which traditionally takes place on paper, and is distributed in textbooks or tutoring books. Unfortunately, these materials are usually designed for average learners, and it is often difficult to find the best-fitting content for students with differing abilities and skills. “Literate” students may need a higher-level tutoring, and “illiterate” may need a lower-level tutoring. Therefore, the depth and flexibility of ability gained from these textbooks are restricted. Some programs based on e-learning technology may provide personalized contents for learners by collecting the learning process. But kindergarten and primary students will certainly become restless and unfocused when staying in front of computers for long periods of time. As putted by Warschauer (2007), “New technologies do not replace the need for strong human mentorship, but, indeed, amplify the role of such mentorship”. Obviously students must become into contact with the new teaching/studding tools progressively, in order for they to become a part of the learning environment as smoothly as possible. Resnick (1998) and Sylla et al. (2018) discuss how computationally enhanced manipulative materials, called “digital manipulatives”, may be designed to radically change the traditional progression, i.e., from direct manipulation of physical objects, such as Cuisenaire Rods and Pattern Blocks, to more abstract formal methods. These new manipulatives, such as programmable building bricks and communicating beads, “aim to enable children to continue to learn with a kindergarten approach even as they grow older, and also to enable young children to learn concepts (in particular, systems concepts such as feedback and emergence) that were previously considered too advanced for them”. In this context, at least in Portugal, the typical educational computer applications are being developed to be used in desktop computer systems or laptop computers. Consequently, the interaction of the child with the application is typically made using the keyboard, mouse (or other pointing system), leading to an additional barrier. More recently, the market is assisting to the growing of solutions for mobile devices, commonly known as “Tablets” and/or “iPads”, especially in the English language. The utilization of this type of devices to teach/learn can be classified in the field of Mobile-Learning (m-Learning). One of the greatest advantages that can be pointed out is the possibility to use it anytime and anywhere. Additionally, the kind of interaction is more “natural”, because the traditional “mouse like” (or keyboard) interaction can be replaced by the direct screen touch. Here we present a system to teach and learn pre-writing skills (graphisms). This system is composed by two components: the hardware component, the Android Tablet; and the software component, forming the exercises/games that the child must solve/complete. The software component as two modules: the server and the client. As suggested by the name, the server component runs at the server side, and is responsible to send to the client (i.e., the Android Tablet) the exercises/games that a child should do. Besides this, the server module also includes all the management functions, which will be explained later. The client module, runs on the Android Tablet, and has an engine that executes the exercises/games; it also has a communications module, responsible to communicate to the server all the data (child name, number, class, exercise number, execution time, number of tries, etc.). We believe that a presentation of some of the concepts and materials will help in better understanding the system and the choices we have taken. Section 2 is devoted to the presentation of the literature review and related software applications. The system is presented in section 3. Section 4 is used to present and discuss the results achieved so far. The paper ends with the conclusions and future work section. 2 Related work 2.1 Handwriting and the use of IT There are several factors determining the difficulty of handwriting for children (Feder and Majnemer, 2007; Berninger and Rutberg, 1992; Hammerschmidt and Sudsawad, 2004). These factors can be categorized into external and internal factors. Examples of external factors include instructional procedures and materials used during writing. Internal factors are abilities found within the child: visuomotor skills; visual perception; motor planning, that is, the ability to plan new motor behavior; in-hand manipulation; and kinesthetic awareness. For example, Conroy (2004) notes that children need to perfect coordination in order to learn writing skills, because “through repetition and practice of specific movements, the brain and muscles learn to work together as a team”. In line with this idea, Striker (2001) points out, among other, the following tips for beginning writers: • Realize children learn best through modeling (use drawings on a board to illustrate characters or objects in a story). • Don't rush into writing (allow youngsters time to experiment with shapes and alphabets by “scribbling”). • Plan for fun opportunities. According to Levine (1987) all children, including those with handicaps, must go through the following stages of pre-writing: • Scribble or pretend to write; • Gain the awareness that letters can be arranged to form words; • Begin to organize letters and shapes in a line; • Begin to print letters and numbers; • Become adept at printing letters; • Become preoccupied with visual appearance of writing; • Use invented spelling of words liberally. Additionally, there are several research studies reporting the potential, advantages and disadvantages, and risks of using Information Technologies—IT (which some authors define as Information and Communication Technologies—ICT) in the teaching and learning, and in particular of pre-writing skills; see, for example, Rogers and Graham (2008) and Castilla et al. (2016). The review presented by Wollscheid et al. (2016) aims at assessing the emerging literature on digital writing tools, such as Computers and Tablets, compared to traditional writing tools like pen (or pencil) and paper, on early writing outcomes among first writers. In particular, Tablets, iPads and other mobile devices are being used in many different fields with many objectives. For example, Foley and Masingila (2015) used these devices as assistive technologies in resource-limited environments for learners with visual impairments in Kenya. Krcmar and Cingel (2014) have researched parent-child joint reading in traditional and electronic formats. Matthews and Seow (2007) have tried to understand children's representations through their interactions with digital paint. The use of these mobile devices to learn aural skills have been researched by Chen (2015). Additionally, the ever growing interest of schools in engaging students with mobile learning, from preschoolers through high school-age students, during and beyond the school day, and in “bring your own device” (BYOD) models is reported by Grunwald Associates LLC (2013). Wollscheid et al. (2016), in their research review, concluded that the benefits of replacing handwriting by typing in early writing instruction lack consistent evidence. As stated by these authors, “studies with a cognitive psychological and those with neuroscience and learning perspective point in favor of handwriting, studies with a socio-cultural perspective rather point in favor of digital writing. The studies that used a cognitive psychology and neuroscience and learning approach applied quasi-experimental or cohort designs, while studies based on a socio-cultural perspective mainly were qualitative”. Genlott and Grönlund (2013) used their “Integrated Write to Learn” method to improve literacy skills. Children in the 1st grade “use computers and other ICT tools to write texts and subsequently discuss and refine them together with class mates and teachers”. Only at the 2nd grade students do handwriting. They claim that “the biggest improvement concerned writing skills”, but reading skills were also improved considerably. They also found that “students in the test group wrote longer texts with better structure, clearer content, and a more elaborate language”. Sulzenbruck et al. (2011) showed that the skill to produce precisely controlled arm-hand movements is related to the usage of computer keyboards in producing written text in everyday life. As stated by the authors, “this result supports the notion that specific cultural skills such as handwriting and typing shape more general perceptual and motor skills. More generally, changing technologies are associated with generalized changes of the profile of basic human skills”. van Mier and Hulstijn (1993) investigated the initiation time required in handwriting. They used letters, figures and patterns, both familiar figures and novel nonsense (unfamiliar) patterns. They found that initiation time increases linearly with the number of strokes, but the “effect was much larger for figures and patterns than for letters, and rapidly decreased with practice (successive presentations)”. In a second experiment, they used the same stimuli, but the number of strokes had to be doubled by requiring the subject to draw each line twice. For the figures and patterns, the initiation time increased significantly with the increasing number of strokes, but the increase was irrespective of the number of strokes for letters. As the authors state “these results suggest that the planning of a movement sequence involves several levels and that the amount of preprogramming is highly influenced by the amount of motor practice”. Several researchers have addressed the study of handwriting characteristics (differences) among children with disability problems and children with no problems (proficient vs non-proficient). For example, Barnett et al. (2018) have proposed a “Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS)”. This non-language dependent scale aims at being a “quick and practical tool to assess legibility” in children facing handwriting difficulties. From the analysis of the results obtained, the authors concluded that this scale “may be a useful tool to identify poor handwriting legibility, with application across different languages and writing scripts”. As stated by Prunty et al. (2014), “There is substantial evidence to support the relationship between transcription skills (handwriting and spelling) and compositional quality”. In this study, the authors tested a free-writing task, with children with developmental coordination disorder. The results indicate that “children with developmental coordination disorder performed significantly below their typically developing peers on five of the six Wechsler objective language dimensions items”, and that they also have a higher percentage of misspelled words. They concluded that the handwriting difficulties typically reported in children with developmental coordination disorder “have wider repercussions for the quality of written composition”. Also included in this research field, Rosenblum et al. (2003) used computerized temporal measures to examine and compare the writing process of proficient and non-proficient third grade handwriters. They compared temporal handwriting measures of two groups of 8 and 9 year old children, and the teachers of the classroom used a questionnaire to identify 50 students who were non-proficient handwriters and 50 students who were proficient handwriters. They recorded the “total time”, “on paper time”, “in air time”, “speed” and “number of characters per minute”, as the participants performed graded writing tasks. The results showed that “non-proficient handwriters required significantly more time to perform handwriting tasks”, and that their “in air time” was especially longer, when compared to the proficient handwriters. Additionally, their handwriting “speed” is slower, and they write fewer characters per minute. They concluded that “the use of a computerized handwriting system provides objective temporal measures of handwriting performance, and may lead to the development of additional tools for the evaluation and treatment of handwriting difficulties”. Another example is presented by Rosenblum et al. (2016), where unique handwriting performance characteristics of children with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFASD) were studied. They compared the handwriting process and product characteristics of children with HFASD to those of typically developing children, with the aim to determine the best means of differentiation between the groups. The children have performed three graded writing tasks on electronic Tablets, and their paragraph copying product was then evaluated using the Hebrew Handwriting Evaluation (HHE). They found significantly inferior handwriting performance among children with HFASD, in both the handwriting process and in the product measures. Finally, the behavior organization of children with Developmental Coordination Disorders (DCD), in varied tasks requiring generating and monitoring mental representations related to space and time requirements, was studied by Rosenblum (2015). She evaluated 42 children (aged 7–10) using handwriting tasks on Tablets. In addition, teachers from the classroom completed a questionnaire for assessing atudents' organizational abilities-teachers (QASOA-T), to assess the children's daily organizational ability. She found significant group differences (DCD versus controls), for all handwriting kinematic measures and for the children's organizational abilities. Berninger et al. (2009) tested the writing by pen and by keyboard with children with and without learning disabilities in transcription (handwriting and spelling). The two groups did not differ significantly in verbal IQ but did in handwriting, spelling, and composing achievement. Although the groups did not differ in total time for producing letters by pen or keyboard, both groups took longer to compose sentences and essays by keyboard than by pen, wrote longer essays with faster word production rate by pen than by keyboard, and wrote more complete sentences when writing by pen than by keyboard. 2.2 Software review As far as our knowledge, there is no system (or Application—“App”) available, using the same approach and ideas as those used in the one presented and discussed here. However, there are some tools available for helping in the teaching and learning of pre-writing skills that share some of the ideas that we have used for the development of our system. Some of these tools include websites and Android applications (apps). Almost all of the sites, and their contents, are presented as being part of “therapeutic activities”. For example, the site “Therapy Street for Kids” is “your short cut to finding therapeutic activities to enhance your child's school occupational therapy program”. There we can find a list of “skill areas”, such as fine motor, crossing midline, handwriting, self-help and so forth, and related activities. Many activities address more than one skill, and typically are easy to do at home and with common materials we probably already have. The major therapeutic associations in the world have their sites available with useful activities and links; see, or example, the “Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists” site The list of available Android Apps to teach/learn pre-writing skills, is huge. A review of them all is beyond the objectives of this work, but we believe that the highlighting of some of their main characteristics will help clarify some of the options we have taken during the development of the system presented here. Table 1 presents a list of the ones we elected as the most representative. All these applications include some sort of animations and sounds, including associating a letter to a word (e.g., name of an animal) and its sound when pronounced. As we can see, the majority of these Apps were developed in English, and let children “print” upper and lowercase letters and numbers. Some of them include sets of shapes (‘arrow’, ‘circle’, ‘crescent moon’, ‘cross’, ‘diamond’, ‘ellipse’, ‘heart’, ‘heptagon’, ‘hexagon’, ‘octagon’, ‘parallelogram’, ‘pentagon’, ‘polygon’, ‘rectangle’, ‘square’, ‘star’, and ‘triangle’) for the children to color, fill or follow the contour. The possibility to adjust the color, shape and width of the “pencil” is also present in some of them. The writing of the letters or the contour shapes can be fully guided (i.e., the child must follow the path of the letter and start at the beginning point—initial point—and end at the ending point), partially guided (i.e., as long as the child paints the path of the letter it will be considered correct/well succeeded, no matter the order and color of the strokes), or loose (although children do have a “reference model” to follow they can “print” the letters, numbers or shapes anywhere in the screen, i.e., it is not mandatory for the child to follow the “path” of the letter, number or shape). Finally, the difficulty level (easy, medium, and hard) can also be adjusted in some of these Apps. Most of the characteristics present in the system proposed here are also present in these Apps, in particular in the “Patchimals — First lines”, by “Patchimals”, and “Writing Wizard”, by “L'Escapadou”, Apps. As will be explained in detail in section 3, our Android App (i.e., the game engine) is integrated in the learning/teaching system proposed here, and data will be gathered during the execution of the exercises/games and presented to the teacher, so that he/she can analyze the results and adapt the next exercises to the needs of the children. Also, the execution of these exercises/games by the children is fully guided (if a child tries to print a point elsewhere in the screen it will not be printed; only those points at the pre-established path and obeying the pre-established order will be printed). For example, if a child begins by “pressing” the screen at the ending point of the sequence it will not be printed; this is not the case with “Patchimals — First lines” App. The system we present here is not intended for the writing of letters; it uses only pre-writing shapes and the number of shapes available is very big (at least when compared with the majority of the Apps listed in Table 1). As can be seen, there is a lot of research in the field of handwriting and computer-based (keyboard) writing, discussing the benefits of each over the other. However, the number of works testing the use of devices that enable the “direct” use of handwriting (like Tablets) is very low. Here, we propose a system that uses Android Tablet digital devices to develop handwriting skills, trying to take advantage of the fact of being a flashy appealing media for the children, and, at the same time, being closer to the “traditional” way of handwriting learning, and thus developing the competences associated to that way of learning. 3 The system Agudo et al. (2015) have showed that the design of hyper-media tasks can be optimally implemented when following previous phases of data collection on preferred items. The results showed the need to steer the learning path towards an effective adaptation to the children's cognitive abilities. These facts deeply influenced the way we developed the system presented here. Additionally, to the development of the system presented here, whenever applicable, we have had in mind the recommendations presented and discussed by Sim et al. (2006), Rubens et al. (2005) and Squires and Preece (1996). The user of this system must be registered, and in order to get full access to the features of the system s/he must pass through the authentication (login and password) process. Only the data of registered users will be sent and inserted in the database. A non-registered user has access to general information and may download a demo version of the Android app. Fig. 1 presents a block diagram with the relations involved and information flow in a typical working session. As explained below, first, the teacher creates the set of exercises/games that the student/child should solve. The child should solve the exercises/games recommended by the teacher, but can also randomly solve exercises/games from the list of existing ones. Statistical data will be only gathered for the exercises proposed by the teacher. These data will be available for the teacher, student/child and parent. As stated in the introduction section, this system is composed of two components: the hardware component, the Android Tablet; and the software component, forming the exercises/games that the child must solve/complete. The software component as two modules: the server and the client. The server component runs at the server side, and is responsible to send to the client (i.e., the Android Tablet) the exercises/games that a child should do. The server module also includes all the management functions. The client module, runs on the Android Tablet, and has an engine that executes (“runs”) the exercises/games. 3.1 Server module To develop the server module, we have used PHP, HTML 5, JavaScript, and MySQL. This module works like a typical web-portal, implementing some of the functionalities available on typical Learning Management Systems (like, Moodle, Sakai, etc.). Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of the server module. The server module has a management component that includes everything related to the management of the daily life in the kindergarten/school. This includes the traditional operations of creating, changing, deleting and reporting (listing and plotting) users, kindergartens/schools, classes, exercises, among other. Also included in the management component is the statistics module, which grabs and processes all the data, and modules responsible for the downloading of exercises to the Android Tablet, help, and exiting the system. The databases module is able to manage distinct databases, including the databases for the exercises, images used to produce the exercises/games, as well as all the information related to the registered kindergarten/school, classes, users, storing of statistics, among other. Once logged into the system, a teacher may propose new sets of exercises/games for the children to solve, access the statistics module, and all other functionalities provided by the server module. The teacher may query information from a child (individually), a group of children or the entire class. This information includes grades/marks, time spent per exercise, number of tries, among other. There are several researchers proposing and using different systems to automatically provide the students with the exercises they must solve during their working sessions. Examples of such system are the ones proposed by Chrysafiadi et al. (2018) and Troussas et al. (2019). However, here we have intentionally leave this responsibility to the teachers; as such, in the current version of the system proposed here, there are no exercises automatically provided by the system. The statistical data gathered by the system can be used by the teacher, but it is solely the responsibility of the teacher to provide the students/children with the next exercises to solve. To produce a set of exercises/games (i.e., prepare a typical work session), the teacher simply chooses the exercises/games from the existing ones, and then the group of children who should apply. A teacher can have the groups of children s/he wants by just creating emailing lists (e.g., for different classes, and groups in a class). Statistical data is “attached” to a particular set. The teacher may also concatenate statistical data from several groups of students and sets. This may be very helpful if the class needs to be divided into several groups (e.g., due to its heterogeneity). The data can be either presented as lists/tables or plots. Note that a teacher may individual- and directly set in each Android Tablet the exercises/games a child should do. 3.2 Client module The client module was fully implemented in Android. It has four main components: the management module, the game/exercise engine, the configurations module, and the communications module. Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the client module. The management module does all the management of the client side (Android) application: it maintains the user/child information, the exercises/games to be executed, configuration profiles, and controls all the operations flow of the application. Exemplifying, if there should be two or more children sharing the same Android Tablet, then the data concerning the user/child executing the exercises/games must be changed every time the user/child changes. Then, the management module calls the module to collect the user data and stores it in the local Android Tablet database. Every time an exercise/game should be completed, the management module calls the game engine module and passes it to the exercise/game. When the exercise/game finishes the results are passed to the communications module, to transmit it to the server (if an Internet connection exists, or saves the data in a local database for later transmission). The exercises/games engine gets the exercise/game to be executed from the management module and runs it. After completion of the exercise/game, it returns control to the management module. The engine must receive a background image, that serves as the context of the game, and a sequence of coordinates, that actually constitute the pre-writing path (and hence the exercise). In other words, the child must press the screen at the coordinates of the path in order to correctly “travel the path” and fulfill the exercise/game objective. This set of points (coordinates) mark out the child's writing. Fig. 4 helps to clarify this idea. The gray dots show the correct path that a child must travel in order to complete the exercise, and hence practice his/her pre-writing skills. In this example, the bee is collecting pollen to make honey, and is flying from one flower to another. The background image gives the context (the bee, flowers, sun, etc.), and the dots provide the path to be filled by the child. Note that only the gray dots will be highlighted, if they are touched in the correct order and within the limits of the maximum error allowed (brush/pencil width). The configurations module keeps track of the current configurations of the Android application. These data include the user's login, kindergarten/school, class, teacher, etc., but also the exercises/games running options, which include four options: width of the brush, help on/off, multiple strokes on/off, and sound on/off. In its current version, the width of the brush is directly related to the degree of difficulty, because the thinner the brush the harder the completion of the exercise/game. In other words, if the same exercise/game is accomplished with a thicker brush the “error” that a child can make is greater, also meaning that the strokes of the brush are wider and hence the precision of the path can be much lower. Linked to this “difficulty level” is the option “multiple strokes” on or off. If this option is on, this means that a child may raise the painting brush (his/her finger or pointer) as many times as needed (the number of strokes/tries will be saved). If this option is off, the child must accomplish the exercise in a single try (which is very hard to do). When the “help” option is on, the next point in the stroke will be highlighted; this works like a “guiding green dot” which the child should follow to complete the exercise/game. If the “sound” option is on, for every correct dot/stroke of the brush a ‘click’ sound will be heard, and at the end of the exercise/game an “applause” will also be heard. The communications module is responsible to send and receive every data to and from the server. This includes receiving the exercises/games to be played, comprising the background image and the set of coordinates of the path, and sending the results of the exercises/games to the server for storage and processing. These results include the total difference to the “ideal path” (the gray dots presented as “guiding lines”), number of strokes/tries, the total time, and total effective time of the exercise/game. As noted before, if no Internet connection is detected these data will be locally saved and will be sent to the server as soon as an Internet connection is available. The communications processes are implemented using web-services. The difference to the ideal path is computed in the following way: the lengths (norm of the vectors) representing the ideal and the painted paths are computed and then the final difference will be equal to the absolute value of the difference between them, i.e., | | | ideal path | | − | | painted path | | | , where | | ⋅ | | denotes the norm of the vector and | ⋅ | the absolute value. The number of tries/strokes corresponds to the number of times the child raises her/his hand/finger from the Android Tablet to complete the exercise/game. The total time is the elapsed time since the child produces the first screen touch, until s/he completes the exercise/game. This includes all pauses. When an exercise/game is about to start a “ready to start” message is presented. The “total time” clock starts counting right after the child touches the screen (anywhere), even if the child will take a bit longer to find the starting point of the path. On the other side, the “effective time” clock will start counting only after the child hits the beginning of the path and will not include eventual pausing times. This will be used by the teacher, for example, to see if a child has any difficulties identifying the start of the sequence, which seems to be the case if the child has some kind of cognitive problem. 4 Results The system proposed here was developed having in mind the teaching and learning of pre-writing skills, i.e., kindergarten and first year of primary school. The system was tested in two Kindergartens in the city of Vila Real, Portugal. More specifically, pre-writing skills sessions were developed with the children attending the Kindergarten of the Basic School of “Árvores”, below designated by Room 1, belonging to the Grouping of Schools of “Diogo Cão”, and the Kindergarten of “Mateus”, below designated by Room 2, belonging to the Grouping of Schools of “Morgado de Mateus”. Informed consent was obtained from all the parents of the children involved in this study. Room 1 consisted of 23 children, 10 boys and 13 girls: 2 with 6 years old, 11 with 5 years old, 5 with 4 years old and 5 with 3 years old. Room 2 comprised 21 children, 11 boys and 10 girls: 9 with 5 years old, 6 with 4 years old and 6 with 3 years old. In Room 2 there were 2 students of Romanian origin, who rarely attended the room, and 3 students of gypsy ethnicity. Although all the children in these rooms (both in room 1 and room 2) had contact and used the Tablets, we only present and discuss the results achieved by children with 5 and 6 years old, both for experiment 1 and experiment 2 (presented in the next subsections). Four Android Tablets were available for each of the rooms, implying that students had to share these devices. Thus, the teacher responsible for each of the rooms was asked to update the “user data” whenever there was a change in the student using the Tablet. We started by using a two-week trial period where the children could interact with the Tablets and experience the different games/exercises in a more or less free and flexible way. After this initial period, several work sessions were held; the data presented below corresponds to the period of time from the beginning of November 2016 to the end of March 2017. Statistical analyzes were performed using the SPSS Statistics software package (v.24, IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL), with α = 0.05 . We have conducted two different experiments, reported in the following subsections. 4.1 Experiment 1 The first unexpected fact relates to the existence of a considerable number of records in the database, all associated with Room 1, with “userID” equal to −1, meaning that the user is not registered in the database. In a first analysis to the data contained in the databases we were unable to identify the reason for such situation. However, after the manual copy of the data from Room 2, which, contrary to what was expected at the beginning of this study, did not have an Internet connection, we were able to identify the “source of the problem”. We had foreseen that if the Internet connection was not available (for example, due to network loss, accidental disconnection of the network from the Tablet by the children, etc.), data for all work sessions would be recorded locally in a database. When we manually imported this database into the global database, we found the names of students without accents, with lowercase letters, with extra spaces between the first and last names, among others. Although this was not the Room where the problem had been detected, it undoubtedly helped us to solve it. Of course, in this situation, the user data were corrected manually, resulting in a much higher data available for Room 2, and as a consequence we only have used the data of Room 2 in Experiment 1. Data recorded in the database and used in this test were as follows: • student identification; • number (identification) of the exercise; • date and time; • degree of difficulty, this being determined by the combination of the following options: – the width of the stroke/brush, which can be thin (harder), medium (medium difficulty), and thick (easier); – the sound: on—easier (there is sound aid), or off—harder (no sound aid); – the stroke: single—the exercise must be completed in a single attempt (harder), or multiple strokes—several attempts may be made (easier); – the help, which may be on, indicating the “next point” in the exercise (easier), or off—not indicating the “next point” (more difficult); • number of attempts used to finish the exercise; • the difference between the graph made and the one considered ideal; • the total time to complete the exercise; • effective time; • the percentage of completion of the exercise (divided from 0 to 25%, from 25 to 50%, from 50 to 75% and from 75 to 100%). Although in total there were 5194 records of exercises performed by the children of the two Rooms, from November 2016 to March 2017 (547 relating to Room 1, and the remaining ones relating to Room 2), and for the reasons of incoherence presented above, the data presented below were collected from 7 5-year-old children from Room 2, using exercises where the degree of difficulty was minimal (large stroke/thick brush, multiple strokes/more than one attempt, sound on and help on) and totally (100%) completed by these children, in the following terms: • the earliest date (in the study period) of each exercise for each child was chosen as moment M1 (November 2016); • the most recent date (in the study period) of each exercise for each child was chosen as moment M2 (March 2017); • for each day of study, the “lowest differential” was chosen for each exercise and child: that is, for each of the moments (M1 and M2), the best-performing exercise for each of the children involved was chosen, so that no difference was artificially introduced; • there were only two moments (two results) per child and exercise; a database (for treatment and analysis) was created with the values of these two moments, corresponding to a total of 129 cases. The tables below present the results of the statistical tests applied, where: • “attempts” — represents the number of attempts used to complete the exercise; • “difference” — represents the difference between the executed exercise and the one considered ideal; • “dif. time” — represents the difference between the total time for the completion of the exercise and the effective time. These parameters were chosen based on the literature review presented above. They can also be used to measure the children's accuracy in solving the exercises/games, but also to indicate how motivate the children feel during the execution of the exercises/games, and how challenging they feel the exercises/games are (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Schiefele, 1991; Ames, 1992). To measure the type of statistical test to be applied to the two moments on the various paired samples (number of attempts, difference, difference between the total time and the effective time, etc.) —if parametric using the T-student test for paired samples, if non-parametric using the Wilcoxon test— it was necessary to verify the assumptions of the parametric statistical tests, namely through the application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Lilliefors correction, to analyze the normality of the distribution, and the Levene test for the homogeneity of the variance. Applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, it was verified that all the indexes follow a non-normal distribution (with p < 0.001 ), so non-parametric tests have to be used. To determine if whether or not there was a decrease in the “difference”, a decrease in the number of “attempts”, a decrease in the “effective time”, a decrease in the “total time”, and a decrease in the “difference between total time and effective time” from moment 1 (November) to moment 2 (March), the Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used, and the means were calculated using the parametric t-student test for paired samples; see Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 . As can be concluded from the reading of these tables, a significant reduction was observed in all these variables, from moment 1 to moment 2, with a mean decrease of 23.125 in the difference, a mean reduction of 8.829 in the number of attempts, an average reduction of 5.397 seconds in the effective time, an average reduction of 7.185 seconds in the total time and an average reduction of 1.788 seconds in the difference between the total time and the effective time (Table 5). We can therefore conclude that there has been an improvement in all parameters. It should be noted that the decreasing in the difference between the total time and the effective time in about 2 seconds demonstrates that the children learned what was needed to be done in each of the exercises, significantly reducing the “interpretation” time in each of the exercises. 4.2 Experiment 2 The second experiment consisted in the application of a set of 6 paper-and-pencil based exercises (of the same type as those implemented in the Android Tablets) to two groups of children in the Kindergarten of the Basic School of “Árvores” (Room 1): a group of 9 children of 5 and 6 year-old who had contact with the Tablets, and another control group with 10 children (also 5 and 6 years old) who did not have access to the Tablets (a copy of the 6 paper-and-pencil based exercises can be downloaded from in Portuguese). It should be noted that the choice for the two groups of students both belonging to the same school (Room 1), and not to different schools, was made with the main objective of isolating other variables that may influence the results, among which we highlight the socioeconomic and cultural level and daily experiences of the children. As such, these two groups of children (because they belong to the same school) lived more or less the same experiences throughout the year and had more or less the same opportunities. Note also that both groups have low prior experience of performing graphic activities in “pencil-and-paper” versions, similar to those performed here. At the end, we asked a panel of 5 experts to assess these exercises, this evaluation being “blind” (i.e., these experts did not know “which children” performed “which exercises”). The results are presented and discussed next. Given the reduced size of the sample, 9 students belonging to the “Testing” group and 10 students to the “Control” group, and because this is a case study, we chose to use non-parametric tests. However, the performed tests of normality proved this need. Table 6 presents the results of non-parametric tests. As can be seen, the results are better for the “Testing” group than for the “Control” group, i.e., the ranks of the “Testing” group are better than the ones for the “Control” group. As mentioned above, although the reduced number of samples and the results of normality tests indicate the need to use non-parametric tests, T-test results are shown in Table 7 . Although its validity is questionable, the values presented in this table confirm the best results of the students included in the “Testing” group when compared to the “Control” group. As can be seen, not only the average score assigned by the experts is better (higher), but also the standard deviation is lower (the difference between the scores obtained is lower). 5 Discussion The system presented and tested here was developed with the aim to help the teaching and learning of pre-writing skills by kindergarten and first year of primary school, and having in mind the orientations, principles and rules presented above, in particular the ones presented in section 3. The system grabs a set of data, in accordance with the systems presented in the literature review section. As stated above, from the analysis of the results of experiment 1, we have observed a significant improvement in the children's handwrite performance. We have register a mean decrease of 23.1 in the difference between the ideal path of the graphism and the one produced by the children, a mean reduction of 8.8 in the number of attempts, an average reduction of 5.4 seconds in the effective time, an average reduction of 7.2 seconds in the total time and an average reduction of 1.8 seconds in the difference between the total time and the effective time spent by the children. We have to stress out that the decreasing in the difference between the total time and the effective time in about 2 seconds demonstrates that the children learned what was needed to be done in each of the exercises, significantly reducing the “interpretation” time in each of the exercises. Concerning experiment 2, and as mentioned above, although the reduced number of samples, the values obtained confirm the best results of the students included in the “Testing” group (the ones that have had access to the Tablets) when compared to the “Control” group (not only the average score/mark assigned by the experts is better (higher), but also the standard deviation is lower). Most of the experiments presented in the literature review section used keyboards to measure the children's proficiency (e.g., Berninger et al. (2009), and Wollscheid et al. (2016)). Here, we have tested the handwriting of children directly in the Tablets' screen. Also, most of that experiments were conducted with children with disabilities (e.g., Prunty et al. (2014), Rosenblum et al. (2016) and Berninger et al. (2009)), but here have conducted these experiments with children “typically developing”. Some of the results presented here are in line with the ones presented in the literature review section, and in particular the ones achieved by Genlott and Grönlund (2013). Contrarily to the idea presented by Berninger et al. (2009), although they have tested the differences in writing with pen and using the keyboard and we have tested the handwriting directly in the Tablets' screen, we have found differences both in total time and in the effective time children spend in the solution of the different exercises. In line with the findings of van Mier and Hulstijn (1993), we have found that the “initiation time” in handwriting increases with the “complexity”. However, in our case, we have also observed a reduction of this initiation time, in experiment 1, from moment one to moment two. Parallel to these findings, it is also worth to highlight the statements made by teachers, children, Direction Boards of the School Groups, the Town Council and the educational community in general, in the different interviews carried out with the various media (newspapers, radio and television, both at regional and national level). For example, in the newspaper “Jornal de Notícias”, March 2, 2017, p. 24, it can be read that “Maria Isabel” says that “it is more fun than the dolls”, “Inês” says that the application “is fun”, the teacher Regina Nunes highlights the “good reaction of the children” and the teacher Maria Adélia Matos found that “the elders, when they achieve the goals, have a party. The smaller ones still have some difficulties and there are those who are making contact with this reality for the first time, but it is going very well”. The teachers are unanimous to affirm that this system has potentialities that will allow them to make better profitability of their time. The feedback given by some parents is also very encouraging and motivating. We also believe that children with special education needs may greatly beneficed from the use of this system, in line with what was succeeded elsewhere (Reis et al., 2010; Candeias et al., 2015). 6 Conclusions and future work We have proposed a system to support the teaching and learning of handwriting skills. This system is composed of two components: the hardware component, the Android Tablet; and the software component, i.e., the exercises/games that the child must solve/complete. The software component as two modules: the server and the client. The server component runs at the server side, and it is responsible to send to the client the exercises/games that a child should do. The server module also includes all the management functions. The client module, runs on the Android Tablet, and has an engine that executes the exercises/games, which also includes a communications module, responsible to communicate to the server all the data (child name, number, class, exercise number, execution time, number of tries, etc.). A teacher chooses what exercises/games a child should do directly in the Android Tablet or using the server (from the existing ones in the system). A child does the exercises/games by logging into the system in the Android Tablet. Automatic feedback about the correctness of the answers is provided by the system. The system grabs all the data (number of tries, time spent, etc.) and processes it to present the data to the teachers and parents. Registered parents can see the results and follow their children' s “academic life” by logging into the server side of the system. This system has proved its usefulness, as the results presented above show. In line with the literature review presented in section 2 and discussed in the section 5, we found a significant improvement in the development of handwriting skills in the children throughout the academic year (“Experiment 1”), with a decrease in the difference between the ideal path of the graphism and the one produced by the children, a reduction in the number of attempts, a reduction in the effective time, a reduction in the total time and a reduction in the difference between the total time and the effective time spent by the children doing the exercises. A decreasing in the difference between the total time and the effective time in about 2 seconds demonstrates that the children learned what was needed to be done in each of the exercises, significantly reducing the “interpretation” time in each of the exercises. As explained in the discussion section, although the reduced number of samples, the values obtained for “Experiment 2” confirm the better results achieved by the students that have had access to the Tablets, when compared to the results achieved by the students that did not have contact with the Tablets. Most of the experiments presented in the literature review section used keyboards to measure the children's proficiency. Here, we have tested the handwriting of children directly in the Tablets' screen. Also, most of that experiments presented in the literature review section were conducted with children with disabilities, but here have conducted these experiments with children “typically developing”. Educators, children, directions of the School Groups, City Town Hall and the educational community are unanimous in stating that the implementation of this system was a real success. In the near future we want to implement a forum area, intended to promote the interaction between teachers and parents. Also, we want to add to the system the possibility for the teacher to add new exercises. We believe that this will be possible, because, as described above, the teacher will have to provide a background contextualizing image and the path (“strokes”) that a child must pursue to achieve the final goal. Based on this path the system will automatically generate the coordinates for the Android game engine. We also want to include other classes of exercises/games: paint, count, imitate, copy, identify colors, shapes, spatial relationships, position in space, among other.

        "doc_abstract": "© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Frequently, the vineyards in the Douro Region present multiple grape varieties per parcel and even per row. An automatic algorithm for grape variety identification as an integrated software component was proposed that can be applied, for example, to a robotic harvesting system. However, some issues and constraints in its development were highlighted, namely, the images captured in natural environment, low volume of images, high similarity of the images among different grape varieties, leaf senescence, and significant changes on the grapevine leaf and bunch images in the harvest seasons, mainly due to adverse climatic conditions, diseases, and the presence of pesticides. In this paper, the performance of the transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques based on AlexNet architecture were evaluated when applied to the identification of grape varieties. Two natural vineyard image datasets were captured in different geographical locations and harvest seasons. To generate different datasets for training and classification, some image processing methods, including a proposed four-corners-in-one image warping algorithm, were used. The experimental results, obtained from the application of an AlexNet-based transfer learning scheme and trained on the image dataset pre-processed through the four-corners-in-one method, achieved a test accuracy score of 77.30%. Applying this classifier model, an accuracy of 89.75% on the popular Flavia leaf dataset was reached. The results obtained by the proposed approach are promising and encouraging in helping Douro wine growers in the automatic task of identifying grape varieties.",

Aligned with this trend, and inspired by the results from our pilot study, we focus this research on exploring the potential of a low-cost and open source device for heart rhythm analysis, with emphasis on Atrial Fibrillation (AF). AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, defined as a complex cardiac disease which is highly correlated to stroke and heart failure, and its prevalence is especially high in elderly population. Given the importance and impact of such cardiovascular disease, we performed ECG acquisitions in a hospital setting to evaluate the potential of this device to identify heart rhythms. These ECG acquisitions were performed in 10 patients, accomplished simultaneously with the low-cost device and the gold standard devices used in the clinical routine of the hospital. The data collected from the low-cost device was analysed by the cardiologist specialized in rhythmology, along with the conventional ECG exam analysis, whom suggested 100% accuracy of the low-cost device in differentiating a sinus rhythm from AF. The results also present great accuracy in the detection of atypical cardiac events through ECG analysis, as well as a good agreement for the corroboration of the numerical data from the devices used for this study, as the RR intervals and QTc intervals values suggest.",

This task is particularly difficult to implement in an e-learning environment, where the student stands alone in front of a computer. In this paper, a prototype system is proposed to figure out the concentration level in real-time from the expressed facial emotions during a lesson. An experiment was performed to evaluate the prototype system that was implemented using a client-side application that uses the C# code available in Microsoft Azure Emotion API. We have found that the emotions expressed are correlated with the concentration of the students, and devised three distinct levels of concentration (high, medium, and low).",

The purpose of this survey is to categorize and briefly review the literature on computer analysis of fruit images in agricultural operations, which comprises more than 60 papers published in the last 10 years. With the aim to perform applied research in agricultural imaging, this paper intends to focus on advanced image processing and analysis techniques used in applications for detection and classifications of fruits, developed in the last decade. For the reviewed techniques, some performance evaluation metrics achieved in various experiments are emphasized to help the researchers when making choices and develop new computer vision applications in fruit images.",

To facilitate the access to younger students a robot kit and an Arduino library was developed and made available on GitHub. Some of the library examples include the common algorithms used to solve mazes, like the Flood Fill, Right or Left Wall Following to name a few. Recursive Backtracking algorithm is often used to solve mazes especially if there is a lot of computer power. This is not the case of the Arduino platform that only has 2.5 KB of SRAM and a clock speed of 16 MHz, so implementing Recursive Backtracking becomes quite difficult. In this work we show how to implement Recursive Backtracking to find if there are better solutions for solving the maze. We also show the memory measurements for three Arduino common platforms the Leonardo, the UNO and the DUE.",

All rights reserved.Electrocardiographic (ECG) data analysis can reveal crucial information about the cardiovascular physiological phenomenon, which is modulated by the Autonomic Nervous System. Hereupon, beyond cardiovascular diagnosis, ECG markers can also reflect workload levels, or even physical and mental performance, through Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. Building upon previous work found within the state-of-the-art, this pilot research explores the potential of using a low-cost device for cardiopathy pre-screening, through ECG signal analysis. With the aim of performing the rhythmical analysis, we performed empirical tests from a population of 21 control subjects in a resting position, and an additional 2 subjects, one of them in dynamic condition, in the scope of an exploratory research, using ECG wave segments analysis and HRV features extraction for numerical analysis. Results have demonstrated that the signal quality allows reliable ECG acquisition for further rhythmical and HRV analysis, in stationary and dynamic monitoring, for the bipolar leads applied. There was also evidence to suggest a benefit from including ECG morphological analysis with this hardware and software setup for prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders, although requiring further investigation.",

In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm based on region growing using color model and threshold techniques for classification of the pixels belonging to vine leaves from vineyard color images captured in real field environment. To assess the accuracy of the proposed vine leaf segmentation algorithm, a supervised evaluation method was employed, in which a segmented image is compared against a manually-segmented one. Concerning boundary-based measures of quality, an average accuracy of 94.8% over a 140 image dataset was achieved. It proves that the proposed method gives suitable results for an ongoing research work for automatic identification and characterization of different endogenous grape varieties of the Portuguese Douro Demarcated Region.",

A contribution to an efficient solution for voice packet prioritization is proposed in this paper, using an Arduino platform to implement a dynamic programming algorithm that is capable of finding the most important voice segments to convey in the payload of high-priority VoIP packets. Despite the fairly high complexity of the algorithm versus the limited computational resources of Arduino, the efficient implementation developed in this work demonstrates that the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of voice signals is consistently improved when losses are primarily affecting the least important segments.

But can the future be crafted without the past? We believe that many past inventions crave the future, so their understanding is a bridge of knowledge that must be passed to students. According to Grand View Research website the microcontroller market will rise from the 20 billion units in 2015 to an amazing 39 billion units in 2020. Therefore, an increase on IT careers is also expected. The Morse code and the telegraph revolutionized long-distance communication in the past and laid the groundwork for the communications revolution. In fact, although developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse (1791-1872) and other inventors, only in 1844 the first telegraph message, from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland, was sent. To provide the means to students to start learning this technology we have developed four experiences that introduce them to the fundamentals of communications, including the Li-Fi technology. This new technology is based on the Morse code, and can spark again the communications revolution by using tiny, imperceptible flickering lights can provide a new way of sending data to computers and mobile devices. Therefore, we decided to revitalize the almost forgotten Morse code by implementing it with an Arduino in order to lay again the foundations to this new revolution that is coming. This paper presents the implementation model of two Morse code translators, how they work, their implementation, and some results. We also present a VLC (Visible Light Communication) system based on the same principles of the Morse code building this way the foundation for students to proceed with this course of the investigation.",

From these data on, the teacher can easily see where students are having problems and decide what to do next. From the student's point of view, the authors elected as main advantages of this system the prompt feedback about the exercises correctness, added to the training with different exercises sets about the same subject, besides the utilization of video, color, sound, etc., that positively reinforce child's senses. Their previous results show that students prefer to solve exercises in digital form, rather than exercises in paper form, also showing a more positive attitude towards the former.

        "doc_abstract": "An autonomous DGPS navigation system must use an accurate threedimensional (3D) digital map. However, it is crucial to validate it using data collected in the field. One possible way to validate the map is to employ a vehicle driven by an expert to ensure that the trajectory is plotted within the boundaries of navigation paths. It is essential to take this care, especially when the terrain is very highly uneven and small differences in position may correspond to large vertical deviations. A small navigation error can result in a serious fall, which may damage or even destroy the vehicle. In the Douro Demarcated Region, in northern Portugal, the vineyard is planted on narrow terraces built on steep hills along the winding Douro River. This paper presents the results of a dynamic trajectory survey obtained from a real navigation procedure, carried out by an expert driving an instrumented tractor during the spraying of the vineyard. The results were obtained using a DGPS (accuracy = 2 cm) and compared to an existing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the vineyard already created by the authors' work group, with an average accuracy of 10 cm. The results are shown in a C# developed interface with OpenGL facilities, which enable the viewing of the 3D vineyard details. The results confirm the validation of the methodology previously adopted for map extraction and respective equipment selection. The trajectory of the tractor, including some maneuvers, is drawn within the inner and outer edges of each terrace or path that exists in the vineyard. The interface can also be used as an important tool in path planning to automatically extract the topology of the vineyard and to select the best path to carry out some vineyard tasks. © 2015 Springer International Publishing.",

Examination of the evolution of such implants was carried out, including the detailed analysis of 16 architectures, designed by 8 research teams and implanted in 32 patients. Their power supply, measurement, communication, processing and actuation systems were reviewed, as were the tests carried out to evaluate their performance and safety. These instrumented implants were only designed to measure biomechanical and thermodynamic quantities in vivo, in order to use such data to conduct research projects and optimize rehabilitation processes. The most promising trend is to minimize aseptic loosening and/or infection following hip or femoral replacements or femoral stabilization procedures by using therapeutic actuators inside instrumented implants to apply controlled stimuli in the bone-implant interface.",

The economic impact resulting from a bad PQ would be drastic on all consumers. Computers, uninterruptible and switched power supplies (UPS), and fluorescent lamps/tubes are examples of nonlinear loads that have the consumption of a nonsinusoidal current, which cause disturbances in the power supply system (that may be severe or not). This study discusses residential generic power circuitry analysis and simulation, under nonlinear loads, in connection with undergraduate electrical engineering education. It briefly reviews some of the basic techniques, and presents a software tool that has been found to be very useful in the context. The tool has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be used to teach design techniques or as a laboratory support to study the applicability of known methods to real situations.

Nowadays, they are being developed as active implants with the ability to prevent failures by loosening. The generation of electric energy to power active mechanisms of instrumented hip implants remains a question. Instrumented implants cannot be implemented without effective electric power systems. This paper surveys the power supply systems of seventeen implant architectures already implanted in-vivo, namely from instrumented hip joint replacements and instrumented fracture stabilizers. Only inductive power links and batteries were used in-vivo to power the implants. The energy harvesting systems, which were already designed to power instrumented hip implants, were also analyzed focusing their potential to overcome the disadvantages of both inductive-based and battery-based power supply systems. From comparative and critical analyses of the methods to power instrumented implants, one can conclude that: inductive powering and batteries constrain the full operation of instrumented implants; motion-driven electromagnetic energy harvesting is a promising method to power instrumented passive and active hip implants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The Master-based Active Structure is housed outside the human body; the Slave-based Active Structure is housed inside the implants. ‘Physiological States’ refers to the processing operations that use biochemical and biomechanical measures of the patient′s body in order to model the physiological states of the tissues surrounding the instrumented implants. ‘Implant Failures’ refers to the processing operations that use the effects due to failures (such as the modulation of biochemical and biomechanical changes in the tissues surrounding the implants; and changes in the mechanical, electrical, chemical and communication subsystems of the instrumented implant) to model the failures′ characteristics (such as the type, state and regions of failures). ‘Therapeutic Commands’ uses data about the state of the implants, physiological state of tissues surrounding the implants and therapy results of previous therapeutic commands, in order to generate medical prescriptions to be carried out by the ‘Therapeutic Operations’. These therapeutic commands must be conducted primarily by medical specialists, although instrumented implants can be designed with the ability to “learn” throughout time, by using artificial learning algorithms. The module ‘Mechanical Features’ evaluates the operation state of the actuators, sensors, communication systems and power supply systems (Alpuim et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2012; Yoshida et al., 2006). Fig. 2 The four motion-driven electromagnetic and piezoelectric harvesters already designed to power instrumented hip prostheses (Silva et al., 2013). Fig. 3 The primary power coil around a patient’s hip (Bergmann et al., 2012). Having a coil around the hip is uncomfortable and troubles the activities of the patients.

Nowadays, they are being developed as active implants with the ability to prevent failures by loosening. The generation of electric energy to power active mechanisms of instrumented hip implants remains a question. Instrumented implants cannot be implemented without effective electric power systems. This paper surveys the power supply systems of seventeen implant architectures already implanted in-vivo, namely from instrumented hip joint replacements and instrumented fracture stabilizers. Only inductive power links and batteries were used in-vivo to power the implants. The energy harvesting systems, which were already designed to power instrumented hip implants, were also analyzed focusing their potential to overcome the disadvantages of both inductive-based and battery-based power supply systems. From comparative and critical analyses of the methods to power instrumented implants, one can conclude that: inductive powering and batteries constrain the full operation of instrumented implants; motion-driven electromagnetic energy harvesting is a promising method to power instrumented passive and active hip implants. Keywords Instrumented prosthesis Active implant Electric power supply Inductive powering Energy harvesting 1 Introduction 1.1 Need of instrumented hip implants The number of total hip joint replacements (THR) has increased and it is predicted to increase even more in the coming years (Kurtz et al., 2007). Currently, the need of hip revision procedures is rated about 6% after 5 years and 12% after 10 years following arthroplasty (Labek et al., 2011). In the last 10 years, an increase about 13.6% in the number of revisions was reported by the Swedish Orthopedic Register (Kärrholm, 2010). In addition, the probability to undergo re-revision is five to six times higher after the first revision (Ong et al., 2010). Some Arthroplasty Registers are reporting the increasing use of uncemented and hybrid (cemented acetabulum) hip implants in primary replacements (Bergen, 2010; Garellick et al., 2011). They are also highlighting that most patients, undergoing the implantation of uncemented implants, are patients less than 60 years old. This trend is also verified in projections for the future profile of patients: 50% of the primary THR and 35% of the revision THR will be performed in patients less than 65 years old between 2010 and 2030 (Kurtz et al., 2009). The optimization of the design and material properties of hip joint implants, as well as the surgical procedures to implant them, has been a subject of paramount importance for the research community. The current revision rates suggest the use of different methodologies to optimize the performance of hip joint implants. Considering the advances in the electronic systems, as well as in the monitoring and actuation methods, the instrumented implant may become an effective methodology to maximize the outcomes following THR. If uncemented implants are developed to adjust, by themselves, to the biochemical environment surrounding them, then the maximization of their performance will be achieved. Aseptic loosening is the main reason for revision in hip replacements (Havelin et al., 2009), being currently reported around 70% of all revisions (although it is probably more critical if it is associated to deep infection) (Bergen, 2010). Then, instrumented implants must be primarily addressed to patients who are at risk of early implant loosening. However, it is difficult to predict the long-term behavior of the bone-implant interface, in order to identify previously the group of patients that will likely undergo aseptic loosening. Considering the requirement of long-term implant survival and the idiosyncrasies of patients, uncemented hip replacements can be instrumented in order to operate personalized failure prevention in real-time. The main goal is to minimize the need of revision procedures. 1.2 Potential of instrumented hip implants The concept of Instrumented Hip Implant was proposed as an accurate method to model the biomechanical and thermal environment surrounding hip implants and to optimize the rehabilitation processes following arthroplasty (Bergmann et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2010; Graichen et al., 1999; Heller et al., 2005). Rydell (1966) was the first researcher who designed and implanted the first two instrumented hip implants in two patients, in order to measure orthogonal compressive forces and moments over the neck of the implants. The newest architecture for instrumented hip implants was proposed by Bergmann et al. (2012). In order to study the risk of thermally induced bone necrosis, they developed instrumented hip endoprostheses to measure the implant temperatures in-vivo. So far, only passive implants have been instrumented. This class of implants comprises architectures without active mechanisms, namely actuation systems and command structures. Currently, research is being conducted towards the development of instrumented active implants (Frias et al., 2010; Reis et al., 2012). This approach aims the development of instrumentation for implants with the ability to apply stimuli in the bone-implant interface, in order to control the bone remodeling. The architectures of instrumented active solutions are defined according to Fig. 1, but no prototype was already fully designed. A full active hip implant must comprise (Soares dos Santos et al., 2012): (1) measurement systems to monitor the physiological states of the tissues surrounding the implant; (2) processing systems to model the physiological states of the tissues surrounding the implant, as well as to model the failures′ characteristics, namely the state and regions of failures by aseptic loosening; (3) actuation systems to perform therapeutic prescriptions against states of failures by loosening; (4) communication systems between the implant and external systems; and (5) electrical supply systems to power sensors, actuators, transmitters and processing systems. If aseptic loosening occurs in the interface, then the instrumented active implant must characterize it (in real-time) and perform a therapeutic actuation (also in real-time) to minimize the state of failure, according to a closed-loop control methodology. The actuators, inside the instrumented implants, must operate suitable (then controlled) therapeutic actuations, in order to minimize the state of loosening throughout time. Bone cell proliferation and differentiation can be carried out by electrical or mechanical stimulation of bone cells (Balint et al., 2013; Hronik-Tupaj and Kaplan, 2012; Ignatius et al., 2005; Reis et al., 2012). Instrumented active implants could be developed to comprise a network of electrical and/or mechanical stimulators of bone cells along the critical regions where loosening occurs. Because they comprise communication systems that allow the data transfer between the implant and the external systems, medical specialists can program therapeutic actuations, in order to be performed by the actuators inside the implant. Because these implants comprise measurement systems, medical specialists can monitor the evolution of the loosening characteristics without the need of other diagnosis methods or invasive procedures. According to this concept of Instrumented Active Implant, one can conclude that instrumented passive hip implants can also be optimized to model the biochemical behavior of the tissues surrounding the implant; to model in-vivo the interaction between the biochemical properties of the tissues and the biomechanical properties of the implant; to model in-vivo the failures′ characteristics; and to communicate in-vivo the failure diagnoses during the routine activities of the patients. Non-instrumented active implants are also able to exhibit controlled therapeutic actuation in the bone-implant interface throughout time. Their architectures do not comprise electronics, sensors, actuators and power supply systems based on mechanical structures. Smart surface coating modifications can be used to implement non-instrumented active implants (Lehn, 2002; Lendlein and Langer, 2002; Parvizi et al., 2007). The main drawback of this class of implants is the difficulty to implement accurate therapeutic actuations in response to particular biochemical properties of the bone-implant interface when loosening occurs. Whatever the class of the instrumented hip implants, they require electric powering in order to operate: instrumented passive implants have to power monitoring, processing and communication systems; instrumented active implants have to power monitoring, processing, communication and actuation systems. The goal of this survey is to analyze the electric power systems which were already designed for the particular application of powering instrumented hip replacements and instrumented fracture stabilizers; and to analyze which methods are most feasible for future designs of instrumented implants. 2 Methods 2.1 Literature search strategy Relevant publications were selected in order to compare all the power supply methods and mechanisms already implemented and validated in instrumented hip joint replacements and instrumented fracture stabilizers, as well as to identify the new trends towards their optimization. The search was also carried out reviewing the reference section of all papers eligible from the selection criteria. The collection was completed in June 2013. 2.2 Selection criteria Studies, focusing on the following three criteria, were selected: (1) instrumented hip joint replacements and instrumented fracture stabilizers, which were experimentally validated in-vivo. In-vitro studies were considered if later in-vivo studies, using the same instrumented implants, were published. (2) instrumented implants without percutaneous wired connections. The use of percutaneous wiring is not acceptable for clinical applications. (3) recent advances on power supply systems for instrumented hip joint replacements and instrumented fracture stabilizers. 2.3 Assessment of other literature reviews To our knowledge, only Ledet et al. (2012) briefly reported how telemetric systems of instrumented passive implants were powered. Neither comparative nor critical analyses were conducted so far to the electric power supply systems of the instrumented hip joint replacements or instrumented fracture stabilizers. No authors carried out a survey about all the methods, for electric power generation, that were already applied to both instrumented passive and active hip implants. Moreover, no viability analysis of the methods to power instrumented hip implants was already accomplished. 3 Results 3.1 Instrumentation of hip joint replacements Twelve architectures of instrumented hip joint replacements, comprising electric power supply systems, were designed by five research groups. They were arranged according to generations of technological breakthroughs, as follows: (a) three architectures for instrumented endoprostheses were proposed by: Carlson et al. (1974), and Mann and Burgess (1990) for the 1st generation; Carlson (1993), Hodge et al. (1989), and Mann and Burgess (1990) for the 2nd generation; Carlson (1993) and McGibbon et al. (1999) for the 3rd generation. (b) Kilvington and Goodman (1981) and Puers et al. (2000) developed, respectively, only one architecture for hip prostheses. (c) four architectures for total hip prostheses were designed by: Davy et al. (1988) for the 1st generation; Davy et al. (1988) for the 2nd generation; Davy et al. (1990) for the 3rd generation; Davy et al. (1988) for the 4th generation. (d) Friedmar Graichen, and associated research group, contributed with three new designs for total hip prostheses and endoprostheses: Bergmann et al. (1988) and Graichen and Bergmann (1991) for the 1st generation; Graichen et al. (1999) for the 2nd generation; Damm et al. (2010) and Graichen et al. (2007) for the 3rd generation. A comparative analysis of these electric power supply features can be carried out using Table 1. From the comparative analysis, one can find the following considerations: (1) All architectures have been powered by inductive power links or batteries. Although the choice of the method to power instrumented orthopedic implants has been under discussion, only these two methods were used in in-vivo tests; (2) The electric supply systems were used to power instrumentation housed both inside and outside the implants; (3) Up to 9 years of continuous operation of the electric supply systems were already reported; (4) The electric supply systems were used only to power measuring implants, i.e., passive architectures which were only designed to collect in-vivo data (no actuation systems for therapeutic purposes were implemented); (5) These power supply systems were customized only to power measurement (which were composed mainly by strain gauges and temperature sensors), communication and processing systems; (6) These power supply systems are suitable for research purposes related to the modulation of biomechanical quantities, namely forces and temperatures, and, in general, for all research requiring data monitoring that can be conducted only in laboratory or limitedly during the daily life of patients; (7) Processing units were only designed for power regulation; (8) Lower levels of power were demanded because predicting algorithms, database storage and therapeutic actuation systems were not implemented; (9) No side effects, concerning the operation of the power generators in-vivo, were reported in the 24 patients who undergone the implantation of these instrumented hip implants; (10) High power consumption is demanded by the inductive powering systems due to their poor efficiency; (11) The life span of the battery-based power supply systems is related with the number of systems requiring electric power; (12) The design of these power supply systems is not suitable to perform data acquisition throughout the daily living of the patients. 3.2 Instrumentation of fracture stabilizers Three architectures for distal and proximal femoral replacements were proposed by: Taylor (1996) for the 1st generation; Bassey et al. (1997) for the 2nd generation; Taylor et al. (1998), and Taylor and Walker (2001) for the 3rd generation. Two research groups have conducted the instrumentation of other fracture stabilizers: Brown et al (1982) proposed an architecture for instrumented nail plate implants; Schneider et al. (2001) proposed an architecture for instrumented intramedullary nails. Their electric power supply features can be compared using Table 2. Considerations 1–6, 8–12 from the previous section, which details a critical analysis of the power supply systems for hip joint replacements, are also true for instrumented fracture stabilizers. No processing capability was reported. 3.3 Energy harvesting systems to power instrumented hip implants Recently, the suitability of the energy harvesting methods to power instrumented implants started out being studied. Instrumented hip joint replacements were already instrumented with energy harvesting systems, although without in-vivo results. Four motion-driven electromagnetic and piezoelectric harvesters were already designed and tested in-vitro ( Fig. 2): (a) A multi-source energy harvesting system, composed by two electromagnetic harvesters (a translational and a rotational) and a piezoelectric harvester, was proposed by Soares dos Santos et al. (2013). The translational-based electromagnetic harvester was configured as a mass-spring-damper system. (b) An electromagnetic harvester, based on a mass-spring-damper configuration but with a braking magnet, was proposed by Morais et al. (2009, 2010, 2011). Inductive powering was used for activation and deactivation of the data acquisition and processing systems. (c) An electromagnetic harvester, based on a magnetic levitation configuration, was proposed by Silva et al. (2012, 2013) and Morgado et al. (2012). Inductive powering was also used for activation and deactivation of the data acquisition and processing systems. Their electric power generation features can be compared using Table 3. One can state the following considerations about the ability of the motion-driven electromagnetic harvesting systems to power instrumented hip implants: (1) The amount of energy harvested is based on the acceleration profile that excites the generators; (2) None of these energy harvesters has been optimized according to the gait patterns of patients who undergone THR; (3) These powering methods avoid the constraints related with the operation period of the instrumentation embedded into the implants; (4) These harvesting systems ensure long-term energy generation: they are maintenance-free; the energy source is (theoretically) everlasting; the energy is generated inside the implants, which ensures autonomy and safety, and avoids biological changes in the bone-implant interface; they are not expensive; and, finally, they are easy to implement (Morais et al., 2011); (5) Motion-driven energy harvesters can be designed according to different dimensions, up to nanoscale; (6) The performance of the electromagnetic harvesters, based on mass-spring-damper configurations, will probably decrease throughout time, due to the mechanical fatigue characteristics of the springs. The magnetic levitation configuration overcomes this problem, because neodymium magnets keep their magnetism practically indefinitely and because of the non-contact nature of this configuration (the only mechanical contact is between the free magnet(s) and the cylindrical tube); (7) The major drawback of these powering methods is to require hip movements of the patients, according to nonzero acceleration profiles. Consequently, only very low levels of energy will be generated if patients are not able to perform their routine activities. This problem arises mainly in the recovery period following THR and it becomes critical with the aging of patients; (8) Currently, no conclusions can be reported about the amount of energy possible to be generated by these powering methods, because no accurate nonlinear models have been developed and validated in order to conduct optimization studies. Considerations 1–5, 7 and 8, which were stated for the electromagnetic harvesting systems, are also true for piezoelectric harvesting. The progressive degradation rate of the piezoelectric materials, to repeated mechanical and electrical cycling, cannot be disregarded, as proved by Platt et al. (2005). No fracture stabilizers were instrumented with energy harvesting systems. 4 Discussion 4.1 Methods already used to power instrumented hip implants The use of inductive powering or batteries constrains the full operation of instrumented implants. Although Bock et al. (2012) recently highlighted the importance of the battery systems for medical devices requiring high reliability, their use does not ensure long-term operation of the instrumented implants. Batteries cannot be charged and discharged often without damage and reduction in capacity, which makes them unsuitable for everlasting operation. Besides, specialized circuitry is required to charge batteries. The use of inductive power supply strongly reduces the periodicity of operation of the instrumented implants, because it is uncomfortable for patients (Almouahed et al., 2011b) and it troubles their routine activities, as shown in Fig. 3. However, one must emphasize the suitability of the induction-based and battery-based supply systems for research purposes requiring data that can be monitored in laboratory or limitedly during the daily life of patients. Following this methodology, the newest instrumented hip endoprostheses, developed by Bergmann et al. (2012), uses an inductive power link to supply temperature sensors inside the implants. The supply problem becomes critical if one consider that the concept of Instrumented Hip Implant allows the design of architectures with the ability to monitor the biochemical behavior of the tissues surrounding the implants. The same problem also arises if one design instrumentation for implants with the ability to perform therapeutic actuations, in order to overcome detected failures (Reis et al., 2012; Soares dos Santos et al., 2012, 2013). The power consumption increases as the number of sensors, transducers and actuators increase. Moreover, the greater the number of operations of the instrumented hip implants, the larger the consumption and required availability of the power supply systems to operate. Besides, the everlasting life span of orthopedic implants must be considered a validation criterion. One can conclude that induction-based and battery-based supply systems are not able to promote the optimization of both instrumented passive and instrumented active implants, because the monitoring and therapeutic actuation systems must be ready to perform when command orders are prescribed. Of course the maximum prescription rate of therapeutic commands can be decreased to the maximum operation rate of the therapeutic actuators. However, the maximum operation rate of the therapeutic actuators must be higher than the maximum prescription rate of therapeutic commands if optimal performances are required. Finally, the use of inductive power links can be dangerous for patients if their tissues are exposed to high levels of RF electromagnetic fields for a long time. The low efficiency of this method, as well as the higher levels of energy required by active implants when compared to passive implants, may impair the bone-implant interface. Although there are no conclusive proofs of the effectiveness of the motion-driven energy harvesting systems to power instrumented passive or active hip implants, they are being studied for these particular applications because they can generate energy without any of the disadvantages of both inductive supply and batteries. However, their performances are strongly reduced in the recovery period following THR and when patients are not able to perform their routine activities. Therefore, motion-driven energy harvesting systems are best suitable for patients less than 60 years old with good mobility. More efforts must be conducted to validate them as an effective method (within their limitations) to power instrument implants. Firstly, the energy needs for a measurement system (in order to detect the aseptic loosening), a processing system (in order to characterize the loosening) and an actuation system (in order to perform therapeutic actuations to prevent loosening) must be estimated. Then, each configuration must be optimized taken into account the hip movements during routine activities of patients. The validation of accurate nonlinear models to predict their power generation is mandatory. According to the maximum power harvested by each configuration and the energy needs for each design of instrumented passive or active implant, a particular energy harvester can be selected to supply a particular instrumented hip implant. Moreover, models will clarify if it is advantageous to implement only few macroscale harvesters or many micro/nanoscale harvesters. 4.2 New conditioning systems New conditioning systems are being developed to interface with the energy generators operating in-vivo. The main breakthroughs about this subject are listed below: (a) Le et al. (2006) proposed a CMOS circuitry to interface the piezoelectric energy harvesting; (b) Silva et al. (2012, 2013) proposed power management systems to interface multiple energy harvesters; (c) Telemetry systems for instrumented hip prostheses, powered by in-vivo energy sources, were also proposed by Morais et al. (2009, 2011) and Silva et al. (2013); (d) Silva et al. (2013) have proposed storage systems based on supercapacitors, in order to overcome the problems related to the use of batteries as energy reservoirs. The storage of the energy harvested is also a requirement for the maximization of the amount of available energy. Otherwise, energy is lost if it is not used thereupon the generation, or the system will not be reliable if harvesters do not generate enough energy to meet the power needs. (e) Zhao et al. (2012) developed a miniaturized System-on-Chip (SoC) that can be customized to operate in instrumented hip implants. They embedded a processor, ADC, RF transceiver, EEPROM and SRAM memories, and SPI peripheral interfaces within a 9mm3 SoC. 4.3 Methods already used to power other instrumented implants Prior the optimization of the power supply systems for instrumented hip implants, one must take into account the power systems already developed for other orthopaedic implants. To our knowledge, only inductive power links (comprising components inside and outside the patients′ body) were designed to power instrumented knee implants in-vivo. The main contributions were provided by Heinlein et al. (2009, 2007), Kutzner et al. (2010), D′Lima et al. (2008), D′Lima et al. (2005) and Kirking et al. (2006). Although without in-vivo results, three piezoelectric harvesting systems were already designed to power instrumented knee implants: (a) Almouahed et al. (2011a, 2011b) embedded four piezoelectric elements within the anteromedial, posteromedial, anterolateral, and posterolateral compartments of the tibial baseplate. Their main purpose was to instrument knee implants with the ability to measure in-vivo the anteroposterior and mediolateral distributions of tibiofemoral force on the tibial baseplate, using self-powered methods. They conducted the optimization of this piezoceramic generator, but only using the axial force applied by the tibial component during the gait cycle: they harvested about 11mW of maximum average raw power. Such piezoelectric generators can be customized to power instrumented fracture stabilizers. Their application to power instrumented hip joint implants will result in lower power generation, because of the volume restrictions on the hip joint implant. Their performance degradation is a serious drawback for long-term applications. The major potential of this study is the use of piezoelectric materials both for monitoring and power generation operations. (b) Platt et al. (2005a, 2005b) designed a force-based piezoelectric harvesting system similar to the power generation system proposed by Almouahed et al. (2011a, 2011b). They embedded three PZT elements inside an instrumented knee implant, but with larger dimensions than those used by Almouahed et al. (2011a, 2011b). They reported power generation levels up to 4.8mW of raw electric power under axial loading conditions. (c) Luciano et al. (2012) proposed a motion-driven electromagnetic harvesting system which uses the relative motion between the femur and tibia to generate electric power. In the tibial plate, they embedded two cylindrical coils between two condyles; near the outer surface of each condyle, prismatic magnets were embedded. No generated power levels were reported. The main advantage of this method is to avoid the movement of the coils and magnets during power generation, which in turn minimizes the maintenance needs. It is a preliminary study which may became an important breakthrough for instrumented knee replacements. However, it is not feasible for instrumented hip joint implants, because there is no relative motion inside them or is quite difficult to create relative motion inside them. Only inductive power supply systems were implemented to power instrumented shoulder implants (Westerhoff et al., 2009a, 2009b) and instrumented vertebral body replacements (Rohlmann et al., 2012; Rohlmann et al., 2007). No other breakthroughs were found about electric supply methods to power these implants. 4.4 Viability analysis of other methods to power instrumented hip implants Rasouli and Phee (2010) reported the main energy sources to power medical devices. Morais et al. (2011) enumerated the methods that can be used to supply smart prostheses. The feasibility of these methods must be analyzed in order to power instrumented hip implants: (a) Biofuel cells require organic components to generate electric power. Long-term storage of enzymatic biofuel cells inside the implants is quite hard to accomplish. The use of organic components outside the implants requires power generation outside the implants, as well as energy transfer into the implants, which may conduct to biocompatibility and safety problems. No biofuel system was already developed using organic components of bone. Sakai et al. (2009) proposed a biofuel cell system from activated human macrophages. Bone marrow-derived macrophages could be used for energy generation (Weischenfeldt and Porse, 2008). However, such biological systems are quite difficult to implement and they will cause biochemical changes in the bone-implant interface. (b) The use of radioisotope (such as the plutonium 238) energy conversion raises many toxicity problems (Rasouli and Phee, 2010) and it is expensive (Wei and Liu, 2008), although its safety and reliability were already reported (Wei and Liu, 2008). Research efforts have been conducted to harness its high energy density (Wacharasindhu et al., 2009), but no generation system was designed to ensure more than 30 years of power generation. (c) Thermoelectric generation systems could be designed by harnessing the temperature increase inside the implants during the routine activities of patients (Bergmann et al., 2001). Several drawbacks hinder the development of feasible thermoelectric generators inside the implants: the temperature gradients and rates of temperature change are small; it is quite hard to implement and to keep a cold junction inside the implants; hip motion is required; thermoelectric generation exhibits low conversion efficiencies, mainly at low temperature differences (Rasouli and Phee, 2010). Another approach is to install the warm junction outside the implant, but safety problems and biochemical changes in the bone-implant interface will arise. (d) Power generation based on magnetic coupling (Rasouli and Phee, 2010; Wei and Liu, 2008) presents similar problems as described for the inductive powering. 4.5 Future research Many electromechanical harvesters have been proposed in the last years, but most were designed for vibration-based powering. Sue and Tsai (2012) reviewed those powered by human body motion. They showed that electromagnetic and electrostatic energy harvesters have been designed to operate at frequencies much higher than the frequencies of the hip joint. Saha et al. (2008) also proposed a magnetic levitation harvester, similar with the generators designed by Silva et al. (2012, 2013) and Morgado et al. (2012), to generate energy from human motion, but they optimized it to generate energy inside backpacks. The mechanical deformation of piezoelectric cantilever beams is being quite studied for mechanical to electrical energy conversion. However, the literature has shown that they maximize the power generation within vibration spectrums not matching with the frequencies of the hip joint (Gu and Livermore, 2011; Ly et al., 2011; Morris et al., 2008; Moss et al., 2011; Sue and Tsai, 2012; Zhu et al., 2010). Considering all constraints presented in this Section 4, one can conclude that customized harvesters must be studied specifically for orthopaedic implants. Power generation systems, comprising motion-driven electromagnetic energy harvesters, secondary batteries and/or supercapacitors, are potential solutions to power instrumented hip implants for long-term requirements. Magnetic levitation configurations are particularly interesting because they keep their performance throughout time (their performance changes are insignificant) and they are maintenance-free. We propose the development and optimization of the following three configurations of motion-driven electromagnetic harvesters: (i) magnetic levitation systems using several free permanent magnets, in order to optimize the characteristics of each magnet according to the hip motions ( Fig. 4a); (ii) magnetic levitation systems using several independent windings, so that the optimization of the characteristics of each winding, as well as their operation mode, can be conducted (Fig. 4b); (iii) magnetic levitation systems using hollow permanent magnets around independent windings (Fig. 4c). The research for a match between the use of several free magnets and several independent windings is encouraged. It must also be optimized the relation between the minimization of the generators′ dimensions and the maximization of their power generations. The implementation of electrostatic energy harvesters is an alternative approach to power passive or active implants. However, due to their limited ability to power medical devices by human body motion (Mitcheson et al., 2004; Sue and Tsai, 2012), they are best suitable as secondary power generators. So, the study of the motion-driven magnetic levitation generators must be conducted firstly.

We briefly review some of the basic Fourier series theory, and present an Android application that has been found useful in this context. As expected, the application has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be viewed as a tool to help undergraduate students test and assess the Fourier series expansions on a typical set of signals, whose analytical Fourier series coefficients were found during the theoretical lectures. Additionally, students can also control the total approximation error and the number of terms/harmonics used in the expansion.

Keywords Power management Energy harvesting Hip prosthesis Telemetry Body area network 1 Introduction Recent advances in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have led to experimentation in their use in health care for monitoring on the premises of health care providers and in the patient's home [1–3]. An increase in the demand of such services is highly probable given the current demographics that clearly indicate an ageing population [4]. Body area sensor networks (BASN) and/or wireless body area networks (WBAN) are emerging areas in the monitoring of the physical activity of patients receiving care [5]. Wireless sensors that operate as nodes in a WBAN are driving the development of such technologies. Implanted devices can improve the ability of in vivo diagnosis, thereby reducing the number of visits to hospitals or clinics [6]. The development and implementation of efficient power management strategies remains a problematical area. The lifetime of a wireless device and its performance inside the human body are directly related to its power source, among others factors, being critical in some applications [7]. In current wireless sensor technology, up to 75% of a sensor's power budget is dedicated to wireless communication, where the RF transceiver drains a considerable amount of power, estimated to be in the range of tens of mW [8]. WBANs wireless technologies include the classic Bluetooth and the IEEE 802.15.4, with or without ZigBee network layer. Both of these wireless technologies have high power level requirements for use in implanted devices that must operate for large periods of time with a low power budget and without servicing. With the new Bluetooth low energy (BLE v.4) technology, it is expected that LR-WPAN protocols can be used in biomedical applications [9–11]. The use of such normalized communication protocols, which are also available in common mobile devices, allows medical staff to use mobile devices either locally or remotely to access sensor data. Even though BLE v.4 energy consumption is lower than previous versions, power consumption remains a challenge to the design of power management architectures for implanted applications, especially if energy harvesting solutions are considered. Sensor nodes for biomedical applications, including active implantable medical devices, are still mainly powered by primary or secondary batteries. More recently, significant increases in the energy autonomy of wireless sensor nodes have been achieved by combining supercapacitors and ultracapacitors with batteries [12]. WSNs must work independently of their power source throughout their lifetime because they comprise sensor nodes that continuously monitor the local environment, collecting and sharing data with other nodes or coordinators. If WSNs are powered by batteries, their replacement or maintenance [13] will be required emphasizing the importance of energy harvesting operations. The harvested energy can be stored in reservoirs [8], and consequently managed by a power management system [14], before being delivered to the electronic system of the smart hip prosthesis system. The combined advantages of energy harvesting techniques to supply the smart hip prosthesis embedded electronics’ via energy reservoirs comprises the best approach for developing a set of embedded energy transducers that contribute to main reservoir replenishment. Each transducer must harvest as much energy as possible and, when it is required, the reservoir voltage level must be matched by means of a DC–DC converter [15–18], or by other appropriate technique. When multiple energy sources exist, an optimized power management system must be designed to make available as much energy as possible. In cases where a power failure cannot be tolerated (applications requiring perpetual operation or in applications where certain procedures should not be interrupted), and since the energy transducers may not convert sufficient energy, it is necessary to have a reliable power source such as batteries and/or inductive coupling. The activation circuitry described provides that reliable power source, enabling continuous system operation. A smart hip prosthesis was designed comprising three energy transducers, each one harvesting energy from different energy sources and harvesting locations [19,20]. To efficiently manage energy from the multi-source transducers, together with the activation circuit that remotely activates and deactivates system operation [21], a power management circuitry is proposed to energize the prosthesis sensory system, the bone stimulation actuator system [22–24] and the telemetry/wireless communication system. The telemetry system assessed in this study was built around two RF modules: a BLE112 Bluetooth V4.0 device (from Bluegiga) and a MSP430/CC2500 architecture (Texas Instruments) running the proprietary SimpliciTI protocol. The embedded activation circuit operates as an independent and stable power source allowing continuous operation of the implant even when it is configured or under full diagnosis/calibration. The first section of this article outlines the problems associated with powering biomedical implantable devices and the feasibility of using energy harvesting techniques. Section 2 describes four energy sources designed to be incorporated in the structure of the smart implant in order to meet its power needs. Section 3 describes two RF systems used in the research experiments, and their power consumption over time. Section 4 presents the results of the power management circuit evaluation when exposed to high energy consumption scenarios. The findings of this study are then summarized, providing valuable information on how to incorporate an efficient power management solution into biomedical implantable devices, enabling data collection over a WBAN. 2 Energy sources and transducers Smart hip prosthesis can comprise at least three independent and different energy harvesting mechanisms to overcome fragmentation of available energy. A reliable electric power supply for smart hip prosthesis must be implemented in order to provide an uninterrupted power supply to the implant, which can occur during configurations routines, running specific functional analysis or calibration procedures. In such cases, the system can use the energy delivered by a fourth power source, namely a slightly modified wireless activation system [21], used to power the implant via its inductive link. The following subsections briefly describe the three micro-power generators, the activation system and the changes made in relation to the original circuitry, allowing it to be used with the proposed power management architecture. 2.1 Translation-based electromagnetic energy transducer Vibrations comprise one of the most abundant sources of energy in the human body, emanating from movements, particularly in the hip area. Mechanical vibrations from the abduction–adduction and flexion–extension axes can be transduced into electrical energy using a proper transducer. An electromagnetic power transducer was designed to be incorporated inside the femoral component of the hip prosthesis, taking into account the geometry of the prosthesis and vibration levels over time [25]. This prototype uses a single winding and an inertial mass suspended by means of a spring. The design was optimized by a double winding [26]. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the improvements made to this generator in order to extract more energy. Another major improvement was the replacement of the spring with two magnets to create magnetic levitation thereby eliminating problems associated with spring fatigue [27–29]. In order to improve power production, a stronger electromagnetic field must be used and/or the number of turns of the coils must be maximized. Increased inertial mass velocity also promotes energy production. The main improvements are: (a) reduced Teflon tube thickness resulting in reduced distance between the coils and the central magnet; (b) maximization of the inner diameter of the Teflon tube allowing the possible use of a bigger central magnet to augment magnetic force; and (c) spring removal to reduce friction and enable movement of the central magnet without mechanical coupling. The central magnet is now kept in magnetic levitation by means of the magnetic force of smaller magnets fixed in the extremities of the tube. The size and magnetic force of the fixed magnets were chosen in order to maximize power production. Experimental results proved that the use of equal sized fixed magnets did not provide optimal results. Lastly, the number of coil turns was slightly increased due to the increase in available space. Vibrations due to human movement induce ascending and descending movements of the inertial central magnet. Since descending movements are stronger, the bottom fixed magnet worked as a magnetic brake, stopping the inertial mass before the central magnet reaches the bottom of the tube. The bottom fixed magnet also pushed the inertial mass upwards due to the magnetic repulsion. To allow a free ascending movement, the top fixed magnet was chosen just to be enough to stop the inertial mass before reaching the top of the tube. In the steady state, the position of the inertial mass was defined mainly by the magnetic force of the bottom fixed magnet. As in the previous versions of the generator, the steady-state position of the magnet does not coincide with the Teflon tube centre, allowing similar amounts of energy to be produced in both coils. Since the ascending movement is weaker, centering the inertial mass using equal fixed magnets would prevent a free ascending movement, lowering the amount of energy produced by the top coil. Thus, the position of the coils, the gap between them, the size of the magnets, the length of the Teflon tube and the distance between magnets are all parameters tested experimentally to harvest as much energy as possible. Linear models were developed to predict the operation of the energy harvesting mechanisms, but were found to be insufficient because they cannot completely describe the generator due to nonlinearities that are not taken into account. In order to maximize performance and to reduce volume [20], nonlinear models are being developed to predict the amount of generated energy taking into consideration the multi-displacements of the hip joint. 2.2 Rotation-based electromagnetic energy transducer The hip prosthesis is composed of an acetabular component and a modular ball head. A rotational movement between these components occurs during the human gait cycle. This movement can also be used to produce energy using the rotation movement around the flexion–extension axis and the inward–outward axis. A total of twenty four N52 neodymium disc magnets (6mm diameter, 2mm height and 1.48T magnetic field) were embedded in the acetabular component (Fig. 2 ). The magnets were arranged symmetrically in the acetabulum, 12 in each side, comprising six equidistant groups of two magnets. Their position was chosen so that magnetic field lines were able to cross the upper half of the head ball. A coil (4700 turns) was wound around a Teflon tube with a steel cylinder core with a relative permeability of 100. The coil was fixed in the hollowed upper half of the head, as close as possible to the set of magnets. An AWG42 enamelled coper wire (0.063mm diameter) was also used. The generator described above is under development. However, due to a smaller amplitude movement and smaller relative movement velocity between magnets and coil, it is not possible to harvest as much energy as with the translation-based generator. 2.3 Piezoelectric energy transducer The load over the hip joint can be used to generate energy through the piezoelectric effect. A piezoelectric ceramic diaphragm was placed inside the hollowed lower half of the ball head, just beneath the coil of the rotation-based generator. There is no physical contact between the coil and the piezoelectric transducer. The piezoelectric transducer has a diameter of 9mm, 0.22mm thickness, 0.1mm plate thickness and a resonant frequency of 9.0±1.0kHz. Mechanical energy generated by the axial force, is transferred along the prosthesis but only acts over the piezoelectric transducer through vibration. The prosthesis was designed with no mechanical coupling between the generators in order to avoid force impulses over the piezoelectric element (Fig. 3 ). Instead, electric energy generated by the piezoelectric generator is maximized because it is forced to vibrate due to axial load variations. If there was contact between the experimental elements the piezoelectric element would only give an impulse reply. New research efforts are being conducted to maximize the vibration of piezoelectric elements. 2.4 The prothesis embedded electronics activation system Harvested energy can produce enough energy to power systems with low energy requirements. However, generators can only deliver power for a small amount of time. Sometimes the implant may require an uninterrupted power supply for a period of time longer than that supplied by the energy harvesting system (for example, the smart hip prosthesis may be required to operate for medical examinations such as patient walking on a treadmill for assessment of functionality). To meet such power source requirements, an activation system, described in [21], was included in the design. Fig. 4 illustrates the activation subsystem circuitry. Main changes to the original circuit focused the energy recovery and storage. The original supercapacitors presented problems such as very low charge capacity, especially when charged rapidly, depleting almost instantly when supplying loads with relatively high current consumption. The storage capacitors were replaced by lower capacity units with both a higher and sufficient charge capacity. Due to these changes in the storage elements, it was necessary to protect against damage to capacitors due to overcharging. With the exception of the CTRL output which now has a different function, the activation system components remain unchanged. This system is now being used to supply implant electronics, including the data acquisition subsystem and a low-power RF module used to exchange data and/or to configure the implant functionalities. Activation and deactivation operation of the implant electronics is now of low priority concerning power management strategy. 3 Power management system A power management architecture is described with the main purpose of handling energy harvested independently by each micro-power generator, to charge the system's main energy reservoir. Its architecture and implementation details are given in the following sections. 3.1 System overview The proposed power management block diagram is depicted in Fig. 5 . The main function of the implant prototype comprises the detection of loosening in hip prostheses, which is accomplished by using an acquisition and data processing module with RF communications capability to transmit sensor data to a base station. In this architecture, a multi-power management system handles all harvested energy from the three micro-power generators, charging an energy reservoir, which is based on an ultracapacitor. Whenever the control link is active, i.e., an inductive coupling is established, energy from this connection can be recovered and used to also charge the main reservoir. At the same time, incoming data can be demodulated and used to configure implant functions. The smart biomedical implant electronics represents the implant telemetric subsystem responsible for acquiring implant data and transmitting them back to an exterior device using a separate RF communication link. The goal is to use a standardized LR-WPAN protocol, such as Bluetooth low energy, so that common mobile devices can be used as both a base station and as a gateway to other infrastructures. In this paper, two RF systems are used together with the power management system in order to verify its viability in the project. The RF modules are the Bluetooth BLE112 module from Bluegiga and the MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 module from Texas Instruments. 3.2 Multi-energy source power management system The multi-energy source power management system considers two kinds of power sources: the energy harvesting systems and an independent power source with its own energy storage element (Fig. 6 ). Due to its intermittent character, the first kind of power source is used to energize the implant electronics as soon as enough energy becomes available, allowing it to work for a short period of time. Because power generation is dependent on many factors, such as the frequency and periodicity of the hip joint motion, it is impossible to predict when enough energy will be available. When continuous operation of the implant is required, the second kind of power source must be used. In this architecture, each micro-power generator has its own energy storage and power conditioning specific circuit. All generators replenish the main storage element, which may be composed by one or a set of ultracapacitors. The energy reservoir must reach a predetermined voltage level prior to delivering available energy to the load, indicating a sufficient energy burst to perform some sensing/telemetric action. Thus, the storage element is monitored by an ultra low-power voltage level monitor that controls a power switch. Whenever this voltage level rises above a programmed level, power is delivered to the load which will decrease the voltage level of the storage reservoir. When it falls below the lower level, the switch disconnects the load and impedes the use of the remaining energy. By avoiding the complete discharge of the reservoir, it is possible to reach a new ready state much faster, reducing the time between working cycles. The energy level monitor controls a switch by means of the control signal ELG (Energy Level Good), as shown in Fig. 6. The stable power source, with its own energy storage element, is part of the wireless activation system, that receives energy from an external power and data module through an inductive link. Once the activation system reservoir is replenished, an activation command is issued by the external device. As soon as the activation command is validated, the energy of the activation system reservoir is delivered to the voltage regulator and the load. This is accomplished by controlling a power management system power switch via the CTRL command line. While the external module is kept in close proximity, the implant electronics are continually energized. To stop energizing, a deactivation command can be issued or the external module be removed from close proximity. In the first case the energizing is stopped instantly. In the second case energizing will stop as soon as the energy of the activation reservoir is depleted. The architecture has been developed so that the power sources can work independently or at same time since there is no conflict between them (Fig. 6). The power management system also has a power good (PG) signal line to notify the system of imminent depletion of harvested and stored energy. For characterization and evaluation purposes, only the activation system and the translation-based power generator were used simultaneously. The power conditioning prototype includes system's energy reservoir as two 40 mF supercapacitors (Fig. 7 ). Voltage monitoring is carried out using a specific low-power circuit (MAX6777, MAXIM, USA). The power switches are implemented with MOSFET transistors to avoid bias currents. Isolation between power sources is accomplished by simple schottky diodes due to their low forward voltage drop. Voltage regulation is performed by an ultra low-power and low dropout voltage regulator (MAX1963A, MAXIM, USA). The wireless activation system is connected to the other switch where the signals V WE and CTRL are used. 3.3 Low-energy RF modules To evaluate power management architecture performance, the two commercial low-power RF modules, acting as system load and telemetry devices, were used during the experiments. Thus, both load and utilization profiles would be very close to real profiles, allowing a full characterization of the system power management. The choice of these systems was based on reported low power consumption and data transmission protocols. Texas instruments has released a set of modules based on MSP430 ultra-low-power 16-bit RISC mixed-signal processors. The MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 module is a complete wireless development tool well suited to this research that comprises a processor and a set of peripherals such as built-in timers, UART interface, 10-bit A/D converters, general purpose amplifiers and a set of input/output pins. In this module, a CC2500 low-power 2.4 GHz RF transceiver is used. The SimpliciTI low-power star network stack is used for the communications protocol. The module has a USB-powered emulator used to program and debug the application. The simplest network is composed of an access point connected to a personal computer and an end-device with its own independent power source. In order to measure the power consumption of the end-device module, a simple application is used where the ambient temperature is measured using an A/D converter and transmitted to the access point every second. The module is powered with 3.0V using a power supply (see Fig. 8 for the consumption profile). It is visible that a peak of around 20mA is needed when establishing connection between the two modules. Afterwards the current is kept almost null followed by current peaks related to data transmission. This current consumption profile shows a low average current since it is almost zero for the majority of the time. The second RF module used in this study is based on the Texas Instruments CC2540 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low energy System-on-Chip (SoC). A BLE112 module from Bluegiga was used since it is programmed using a script language that simplifies application development, abstracting the programmer from Bluetooth low energy stack implementation. BLE112 comprises an excellent RF transceiver, a microcontroller unit based on an enhanced version of the well known 8051 MCU, in-system programmable flash memory and a set of features and peripherals such as timers, USARTs, A/D converters, an operational amplifier, a comparator and a set of input/output pins. A Bluetooth low energy USB dongle enables connectivity with a personal computer or other devices with a USB port. It is also possible to build a simple network using the BLE112 module, working like an end-device and the USB dongle, connected to a personal computer, working like an access point. The BLE112 module was also programmed to measure the ambient temperature, using its internal A/D converter, and transmit it to a personal computer, every second, through the USB dongle. The BLE112 was also powered with 3.0V using the same power supply as before. In this case, the average current consumption is clearly higher (Fig. 9 ). As can be seen when comparing the profiles of Figs. 8 and 9, there are several current peaks corresponding to when the RF transceiver is turned on. MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 uses a simple protocol for more efficient use of available energy. On the other hand, BLE112 uses the Bluetooth LE protocol which represents a higher power consumption. It is expected that the proposed architecture will power both modules while knowing that the effective time of use will be greater when using the MSP430/eZ430-RF2500. 4 Experimental results In order to evaluate the proposed power management architecture, an experimental test bed was set up using off the shelf electronic components (Fig. 10 ). As previously mentioned, two power sources were used as well as two complete RF systems, as loads. Each load will be powered using each power source independently and afterwards using both power sources simultaneously. One of the first steps was the translation-based micro-generator evaluation, an improved version of a previous device. Fig. 11 clearly indicates that the new generator doubles the power production compared with the previous one described in [26]. This improved performance results from several modifications, where the elimination of a mistuned spring constant and the addition of magnets to create equivalent levitation have improved performance. By using the energy produced by the translation-based power generator, the MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 end-device was powered for more than 100s, when running the same application mentioned in the previous section (Fig. 12 ). The generator was subjected to 1Hz and 40mm amplitude vibrations in order to charge the supercapacitors. When voltage level at the reservoir reaches 3.3V (the pre-established high trip level), the ELG signal closes the switch, allowing the stored energy to reach the voltage regulator which instantly delivers a stabilized V CC voltage to the MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 module. It is also possible to see the stability of the PG signal. Even though, at some point V CC starts to decrease, the MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 module continues to work until V CC goes below 2V, the minimum working voltage allowed by the module. At this point, the signals ELG and PG and the voltage V CC are reset while the stored energy maintains some level. Under these circumstances, it is possible to power the MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 module for up to 160s. A similar experience was carried out using the BLE112 module (Fig. 13 ). Results were largely similar to those described previously although it was only possible to deliver a stable V CC voltage for less than 50s. This is consistent with the consumption profiles presented in the previous section showing that the Bluetooth low energy module consumes more energy than the MSP430 module, when running a similar application. The second stage of the experiments comprised the evaluation of the power management system using the energy delivered by the wireless activation system. When the external module antenna and the activation system antenna are in close proximity and the external module is transmitting energy, the reservoir of the activation system is charged (Fig. 14 ). Meanwhile, when the stored energy is higher than 3.3V, this same voltage appears at the output of the internal voltage regulator of the activation system. From this point on, it is possible to transmit the activation command responsible for closing the switch, by means of the CTRL signal (see Fig. 6) and delivering the V WE voltage to the input of the voltage regulator of the power management system. As in the previous experiments, a stable V CC voltage is applied to the load. There is no significant difference between results for the tested loads and so only a single result is presented. A last set of experiments evaluated the powering of the loads using the two energy sources simultaneously. Results are also based on a single set of results since they are independent of the load that was used (Fig. 15 ). In order to ensure the systems is working as required, at least one of the power sources must be present and with sufficient energy to maintain the available V CC voltage. Initially, following charging of each reservoir, both power sources are capable of energizing the load. Over time, one of the power sources reservoir is depleted to the point it is no longer viable to power the load but the other remains responsible for delivering enough energy. This procedure was carried out several times; the V CC voltage never diminished (Fig. 15). No adverse effects were observed between the power sources, indicating successful isolation of power sources. The results indicate that the power management system architecture works successfully. It is possible to energize a load with RF communications capability for a considerable amount of time using energy harvesting power sources. Using the energy provided by the wireless activation system it is possible to continuously energize such loads. 5 Conclusions and final remarks Energy harvesting micro-power generators can be used to power applications where batteries or other power sources are not a feasible option. Unfortunately, these generators can only produce small amounts of energy, which may be suitable to power systems with low energy needs. They usually use some sort of buffer that is slowly replenished, until a certain amount of energy is stored prior to utilization. This means that a particular electronic device will only be energized from time to time, depending on how fast the reservoir is replenished, and for a period of time that depends on the energy level stored on it and the corresponding discharging rate. The use of RF-based telemetry systems in orthopedic implants represents an high load to any power management architecture where the available energy levels are very low. However, the use of standardized protocols represents an enormous advantage in the signal processing chain, so that more energy is required to maintain a node connected to a WBAN infrastructure. Besides the RF transmission system in the current design, the energy requirements are still higher, as the orthopedic implant contemplates the possibility of periodic actuation on a piezoelectric film for osteoblast stimulation. The approach taken in this research involves the use of three independent micro-generators to harness the largest number of forms of energy present in the hip movement. Another approach that has also been followed lies in the optimization of each generator by employing nonlinear modeling. The power management architecture outlined in this study allows the incorporation of several micro-power transducers that can contribute individually to the supplying of a reservoir. Furthermore, it allows recovering energy from an embedded activation system, which can also be used to operate the telemetry system when necessary. To evaluate its performance, two commercial RF systems were used to impose a specific discharge regime. It was possible to energize both of the RF systems for several seconds using the energy of a single generator, in this case the translation-based generator. The other two generators are in the early stages of development and require optimizations prior being able to efficient use in applications. Two RF modules with different protocols were tested along with the power management system. The presented energy consumption profiles showed that the Bluetooth low energy module worked for less time than the MSP430 module when powered solely using the translation-base micro-power generator produced energy. Despite this, the operation time is sufficient for establishing a network connection and exchange several data packets to a base station enabling the use of such module in this project. Ongoing work include the optimization of the rotation-based and piezoelectric generators and modeling of the three generators. The models will allow specific customizations of the generators in order to fit the orthopedic volume constrains but still produce the maximum energy possible. The power management system is now targeted to a standard 0.35μm CMOS technology.

The availability of electric power to supply active mechanisms of smart prostheses has remained a critical problem. This paper reports the first implementation of a new concept of energy harvesting systems applied to hip prostheses: the multi-source generation of electric energy. The reliability of the power supply mechanisms is strongly increased with the application of this new concept. Three vibration-based harvesters, operating in true parallel to harvest energy during human gait, were implemented on a Metabloc TM hip prosthesis to validate the concept. They were designed to use the angular movements on the flexion-extension, abduction-adduction and inward-outward rotation axes, over the femoral component, to generate electric power. The performance of each generator was tested for different amplitudes and frequencies of operation. Electric power up to 55 μJ/s was harvested. The overall function of smart hip prostheses can remain performing even if two of the generators get damaged. Furthermore, they are safe and autonomous throughout the life span of the implant. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",

Precision viticulture (PV) and precision agriculture (PA) requires the acquisition and processing of a vast collection of data coming typically from large scale and heterogeneous sensor networks.

This paper explores this need and introduces a framework for smart data acquisition in PA/PV that relies on the IEEE 1451 family of standards, which addresses the transducer-to-network interoperability issues. The framework includes a ZigBee end device (sMPWiNodeZ), as an IEEE 1451 WTIM (Wireless Transducer Interface Module), and an IEEE 1451 NCAP (Network Capable Application Processor) that acts as gateway to an information service provider and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) coordinator.

Keywords IEEE 1451 Precision agriculture Precision viticulture Wireless sensor networks Gateway IEEE 802.15.4 1 Introduction PA and PV practices depend on the acquisition, transmission and processing of a vast collection of data coming from a large scale, heterogeneous sensor network (Camilli et al., 2007). These characteristics and the obvious need for wireless data transmission immediately raises two issues. The first is energy-related. The challenge is how to obtain sufficient energy and how to manage it, so that all electronic devices can enjoy virtually uninterruptible operation. Previous work (Morais et al., 2008a,b) gave valuable information on how to support devices that communicate with each other in an IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee mesh network with energy harvesting techniques to power data acquisition devices with multiple sensors. The second issue has to do with the normalization and interoperability related to the multiplicity of sensors, sensor output types, multi-vendor data acquisition platforms and network support. In PA/PV practices there are many sensors with different types of output: voltage, current, wired digital (RS-485, SDI-12) and many other types. This diversity affects the way sensors are integrated in a data acquisition network. The multiplicity of incompatible network specifications and distinctive data acquisition platforms make the integration of heterogeneous sensors far from simple (Tani and Cugnasca, 2005). The adoption of a common and standard communication interface to abstract the sensor/network/user relation would cut down development efforts, reduce installation and configuration complexity, and facilitate the “plug-and-play” of sensors to a network (Oostdyk et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007; Lee, 2008), improving interoperability and reducing the implementation, deployment and maintenance costs. Solutions to meet these challenges would contribute decisively to improve precision viticulture practices. The need for a framework for interoperability to accommodate these systems and support heterogeneous sensor applications using consensus-based standards to connect sensor networks has been noted before (Song and Lee, 2007). Chen and Helal (2008, 2009) had reviewed and analyzed the standards developed to normalize the process of acquiring and handling data from transducers (Echonet, SensorML, DeviceKit, Device Description Language, IEEE Transducer ML and IEEE 1451), and concluded that the IEEE1451 family of standards arises as the most comprehensive. Besides ensuring the appropriate standardization of data and procedures for data acquisition, it also normalizes the process of communications between devices which, in itself, may represent a huge benefit provided that the implementation of these standards is adequately structured with the necessary services support. Our perspective is that the combination in a framework of standards such as IEEE 1451 and IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee will effectively simplify the integration of devices and equipment in a distributed PA/PV environment, which is characterized by heterogeneous data acquisition systems. This will free farmers from the technical issues often met in such systems (Song and Lee, 2007). In line with this perspective, the present paper describes the architecture and implementation of a comprehensive framework that transforms data acquisition platforms and makes possible the “plug-and-play” connection of various sensors. In our opinion, the need for and usefulness of such a framework has been felt for long, but its implementation has been left behind mainly due to the complexity of the IEEE 1451 family of standards. This article is organized as follows: After introducing the problem of interoperability in Section 1, Section 2 presents a brief overview of IEEE 1451 and what benefits can be extracted from the simplification of configuration and use procedures of wireless sensor networks in PA/PV practices. Section 4 presents the hardware and software that have been used and how the MPWiNodeZ platform described in Morais et al. (2008a) has been upgraded to become fully IEEE 1451 compliant. Regarding the WSN sink node, the functional architecture of an in-field gateway, where all services necessary for the implementation of a complete IEEE 1451 system have been incorporated, is also described. Section 5 describes the IEEE 1451 implementation and the sequence of operations needed to interact with a data acquisition platform. In addition, we present a brief description of the IEEE 1451 management tool, developed in Java language, which accesses the in-field gateway and allows to configuring the devices and collect all data from a proof-of-concept WSN. It ends with lessons learned from this research and valuable information on how to implement a complex but comprehensive standard that can be effectively used to create smarter PA/PV technologies. 2 Overview of IEEE 1451 standard Important efforts have been concentrated on the definition, functionality and communication standards for smart sensors. The goal is interoperability for a wide range of applications. The smart sensor, with appropriate local decision-making capability, can act as an intelligent node in a network, with interoperability aimed as the key argument for an obvious need to support various data acquisition platforms across different networks for network independent operation. Such effort would help expedite the development of networked smart transducers. Towards this goal, the IEEE and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) have pioneered the development of a set of standards known as IEEE 1451. The IEEE 1451, a family of Smart Transducer Interface Standards, describes a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers (sensors or actuators) to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks. The key feature of these standards is the definition of Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS), fully described in IEEE Std 1451.0-2007, which stores transducer identification, calibration, correction data, measurement range, manufacture-related information, and other information, which can be remotely retrieved through a common set of interfaces enabling a “plug-and-play” procedure for transducer handling. The characteristics of self-configuration and self-description provided by TEDS help to minimize human errors and by manually entering of data for configuration reduce the need for technical expertise for setting up and maintaining a monitoring system (Oostdyk et al., 2006). A simplified functional structure of a IEEE 1451–based system is depicted in Fig. 1 . IEEE 1451 divides a sensor network system into two general categories of devices, the Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP) and Transducer Interface Module (TIM). NCAP is a processor-based device that acts as a gateway between two levels of a sensor network with two different interfaces. To the lower level, the NCAP exchanges data with a set of TIM devices where transducers are attached through Transducer Channels (TC). To this effect, NCAP incorporates a communications support to ensure connectivity with the TIM according to the communications technologies adopted by the IEEE 1451 family. To the higher level, the NCAP represents the interface of a distributed monitoring system to a higher level of a network where IEEE Std 1451.1-1999 specifies a simple, complete object model for building smart sensor and actuator-based systems. Remote access to WSN data is thus facilitated by a set of standard services and functionalities that form a layer of middleware services for network management applications. Support communications between NCAP and TIM is normalized and described separately by a subset of IEEE 1451, regardless of the subset IEEE 1451.0, where several possibilities exist: point-to-point (IEEE 1451.2), approved wireless radios (IEEE 1451.5), and RFID systems (IEEE 1451.7). The subset IEEE 1451.5 introduces the Wireless Transducer Interface Module (WTIM), a particular case of TIM where communication is based on an approved wireless radio (IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN, Bluetooth or IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee). In any case all the specifications for effective communications are contained in the structures of Physical TEDS (format, fragmentation and packaging methods for the messages used in communications technology). Each TIM includes the TEDS associated with each transducer which completely defines it. Furthermore, the NCAP may request the TIM’s TEDS, in order to interpret correctly each sensor reading, or send TEDS to be stored in each TIM by using any approved communications medium. More information on all TEDS can be found in IEEE Std 1451.0-2007. 3 IEEE 1451 in PA/PV environments PA/PV applications often depend on spatial and temporal variability studies and employ variable rate technology (VRT) to manage crop inputs. Not surprisingly, they show one of the highest rates of adoption of information technology and communications technology in agriculture. In these studies and/or techniques, an enormous amount of data is collected in real-time by sensors that measure a wide variety of parameters related to crop growth. The wide diversity and heterogeneity of available sensors for this purpose places serious difficulties both for end users and manufacturers. The end users have to struggle with the configuration of the recording equipment, and manufacturers need to worry about making their sensors compatible with the majority of the data collection equipment. The adoption of the IEEE 1451 in PA/PV applications aims to simplify these procedures across all distributed and heterogeneous environments. Since the publication of the IEEE 1451 family of standards, several studies have been carried out (Wei et al., 2005; Oostdyk et al., 2006; Nemeth-Johannes et al., 2007; Song and Lee, 2008; Wobschall et al., 2009; Higuera and Polo, 2010; Seng et al., 2011; Barrero et al., in press). Higuera et al. (2009) described an IEEE 1451 implementation of a WSN based on IEEE WSN 802.15.4/ZigBee where WTIMs were implemented using Tmote Sky modules (Moteiv Corporation, USA). NCAP was implemented over the same Tmote Sky module with a USB connection to a computer. The application interface to the sensor network was developed in LabVIEW and it allows the sending of commands to the WTIM and data storage in a database. This work contributes to the enhancement of IEEE Std 1451.5 ZigBee PHY TEDS by adding eleven new registers for ZigBee support. However, it does not take into account PA/PV specificities and only works on transactions initiated by the NCAP, an option that makes impossible sending out data from the WTIM to the NCAP at periodic intervals without the need for pooling the WTIM. Tani and Cugnasca (2005) in turns analyzed the application of IEEE 1451 in PA and how it could help to improve the processes of adoption of WSN and how the various players could benefit from the introduction of standards with interoperability characteristics, and exchange data independently of the communications network. They point out that the various services provided by the IEEE 1451 network element allow for the implementation of two aspects considered essential: the integration of sensors and data acquisition platforms on the same network communications standard and availability of data in SI units. Specifically for PA, Wei et al. (2005) describe a weed sensing system based on IEEE 1451 and ISO 11783, a communication protocol used in many agricultural machines and based on the SAE J1939 protocol (which includes CANbus). The NCAP is connected to other devices using the ISO 11783 bus, which enables connection to non–IEEE 1451–systems. However, only part of the software module that handles the NCAP interface was based on the IEEE 1451.1. It also described the hardware and software of the implemented TIM (IEEE Std 1451.2-1997) and its TEDS. It concludes that IEEE 1451 provides a flexible solution for the integration of embedded systems from different manufacturers. The modular design and “plug-and-play” capability are attractive and so IEEE 1451 may be a major help to speed up further development of PA technologies. In the context of IEEE 1451 and its integration into PA/PV environments, we associate the data acquisition network with WTIM devices and their TC, which correspond to the deployed transducers (sensors and/or actuators). On the other hands, network coordination is left to a NCAP as a part of an in-field gateway, which manages the WTIM devices and performs basic data integration and aggregation. The adoption of the IEEE 1451 viewpoint brings several advantages: • Uniform device description — every device has a corresponding description in the TEDS. As a result, it is always possible to obtain information about any transducer: physical variable, response time and operating modes, among others. • Easier installation and maintenance — incorporation of additional devices is greatly simplified, in a step towards “plug-and-play” capability. The TEDS incorporated in the WTIM supply all the required information in a transparent way to the acquisition system. Replacing or upgrading sensors (for example, to improve accuracy) becomes a simple matter. • Heterogeneity support — IEEE 1451 was conceived with diversity in mind, and in concept it is well suited to the PA/PV scenario, in which the monitoring of a variety of physical variables is the rule. • Data integration and aggregation — the values of the physical variables acquired in the field (temperature, solar irradiance, relative humidity, etc.) can be transmitted in SI units. This distributes the overall required processing and greatly simplifies the processing, integration and aggregation of data. • Diagnostic — The state registers associated with the TIM and their TC allow detecting and report any malfunctions to subsequently carry out any correction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no implementation of this standard in the universe of PA/PV as comprehensive as the one reported in the next sections. For example, we are not aware of any other work in which a WTIM can start a data transaction over an IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network by its own initiative, i.e., without the need for polling by the NCAP. 4 Materials and methods The scenario chosen to incorporate the set of IEEE 1451 standards in a PA/PV environment, and serve as a testbed for developing and testing intelligent data acquisition devices, comprises a set of data acquisition units with all hardware resources needed to implement all IEEE 1451 services over a WSN based on the IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, and an in-field sink node responsible to manage all the data gathering process. Since each analog sensor is not compliant with IEEE 1451, the sMPWiNodeZ data acquisition platform was upgraded to become an IEEE 1451.5 WTIM, where the attached sensors have their TEDS/TC stored in the WTIM memory. In the following sections, the functional architecture of the network used in this research and the most relevant aspects of the implementation are described. 4.1 Architecture overview The solution that we propose to address several frequently occurring problems in WSN for PA/PV applications relies on the sMPWiNodeZ platform and iPAGAT gateway (Peres et al., 2011). A number of sMPWiNodeZ nodes are deployed throughout the area of interest, to monitor and acquire data from a number of possible heterogeneous data sources. The incorporation of IEEE 1451 services in the sensor network yields a new view of it in terms of NCAP and WTIM entities. On one hand, the iPAGAT gateway becomes (or incorporates) the IEEE 1451 NCAP, allowing external data access using IEEE 1451 services through the iPAGAT data integration system. On the other hand, the data acquisition platforms become WTIM entities that operate under IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. Fig. 2 illustrates the functional architecture of a WSN operating under IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee and IEEE 1451.5, from the point of view of the application considered in this work: monitoring a large number of heterogeneous data sources in PA/PV. A set of WTIM is deployed in the field, operating under a network configuration determined by IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. The information about the associated sensors is described in TEDS, eliminating the need to configure the remote system for the correct interpretation of the stored data. The iPAGAT thus becomes one of the central components of this distributed data acquisition system. Firstly, it coordinates all the WTIM to which it is connected over IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, allowing data collection by category. Secondly, it offers an internal set of services that allow data storage in a local database, which can be accessed subsequently by means of external queries. Finally, the network becomes fully scalable since an arbitrary number of iPAGATs is allowed. This brings to our distributed architecture a normalization of the configuration and insertion procedures of the platforms and sensors in the network, greatly simplifying tasks such as sensor upgrading, and therefore cutting down system and maintenance efforts. 4.2 Functional description of the in-field gateway and network nodes The software structure of the iPAGAT gateway was deeply changed to accommodate all necessary IEEE 1451 NCAP services to create a smart, distributed monitoring network. Fig. 3 overviews the inclusion of IEEE 1451 family of standards over an existent IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee WSN accordingly to Fig. 2. As can be seen in this architecture, the NCAP is seen essentially as a gateway between the external network and the remaining elements of the IEEE 1451 system, the WTIM (Wiczer and Lee, 2005). From the point of view of the external network, the WSN manager uses the NCAP IEEE 1451.1 API to access and manage WSN data to fill the iPAGAT local database. To accomplish these goals, the iPAGAT implements the following NCAP services: • IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee physical interface — Hardware device that supports IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee and, being part of iPAGAT, operates as a ZigBee coordinator for creating and managing the WSN. It must also implement the services to add and remove devices from the ZigBee network, manage the communication paths, ensure data exchange, among other; • IEEE 1451.5 services — Software layer that implements IEEE 1451.5 subset responsible for all processing and exchange of messages between NCAP and WTIM when communications are performed on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee; • IEEE 1451.0 services — Software layer that deals with all IEEE 1451.0 services. The NCAP must be able to interpret all information received from each WTIM and sending commands and TEDS for the WTIM and associated TC. It is also required that the NCAP can identify all sensors attached to each WTIM, interpret essential information about sensing units, measurement limits, acquisition times, modes of operation, and other related information; • IEEE 1451.1 services — This layer is an example of an external network interface, allowing remote access to information contained in the NCAP. There are other alternatives including the HTTP protocol described in IEEE 1451.0 subset and a set of Smart Transducer Web Services proposed by Song and Lee (2007). In the architecture represented in Fig. 2, three management levels are shown. At the WSN level, a set of sMPWiNodeZ devices incorporate the necessary IEEE 1451 services to become a WTIM on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee communication technology. Despite being a mesh-type network, i.e., some devices operate as routers, the connection between each WTIM and its NCAP is a logical star which illustrates the abstraction layer that covers all IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network devices. Each sMPWiNodeZ unit can operate as a ZigBee router in which case, as it is only required to transmit network packets, does not require IEEE 1451 services since there is no need to interpret the data. The iPAGAT represents the second level, the entity responsible for in-field collecting and processing data before making them available to the management level, which can coordinate and centralize data from one or more iPAGATs in a distributed architecture. As can be inferred from the observation of Fig. 3, iPAGAT gateway had seen its software structure grow with the inclusion of IEEE 1451 services that builds the NCAP. Its core is now built around a data aggregation engine, a real-time alert system (RTAS) and a WSN manager that makes MySQL data inserts into a local database. Access to iPAGAT, and consequently to the NCAP, is accomplished through its data integration system that grant access to data stored in local database and enables remote gateway configuration. 4.3 The sMPWiNodeZ platform and WTIM services The sMPWiNodeZ platform, illustrated in Fig. 4 , is an upgrade version of the MPWiNodeZ (Morais et al., 2008a) and implements all functions to turn it into a WTIM IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. It has a 32-bit RISC microcontroller with IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee support (JN5148, Jennic, UK) with 128KB RAM, 128KB ROM and 4MB flash memory. In order to meet the energy needs for perpetual operation (when operating as a router) the sMPWiNodeZ platform can use three independent power sources: solar, wind and moving water in irrigation pipes, as described in Morais et al. (2008b), allowing its internal LiPo battery to charge even when the system is in sleep mode. These energy transducers were also specified as IEEE 1451 transducers, where their TC were characterized within the WTIM structure. The protection against excessive discharge of the battery is also carried out by hardware. The system power is provided by a high efficiency DC-DC converter (MAX1673, Maxim Integrated Products, USA) and a second converter is used exclusively for sensors power supply, being activated only when needed for readings. Analog inputs are provided allowing the connection of sensors with voltage output, an input for sensors with frequency output and a digital input for sensors with embedded digital protocol (SPI, I2C). A separate EEPROM (25LC020A, Microchip, USA) has been included for storing all WTIM TEDS. A real-time clock (DS1343, Maxim Integrated Products, USA) provides all timing signals needed for scheduling tasks and time stamps associated with sensor readings. The sMPWiNodeZ platform is ruled by a set of software structures responsible for energy, communications and peripherals management, with special emphasis on reducing energy consumption. Fig. 5 illustrates the structure of software services with emphasis on IEEE 1451 and its relations with the main application. The interface block called Sensors and actuators HW interface is responsible for physical interaction with the transducers, such as their powering, signal conditioning and analog-to-digital conversion. The sMPWiNodeZ platform implements all IEEE 1451.0 services (defines TEDS structure, command and response messages formats and state registers) and IEEE 1451.5 services (responsible for data exchange between a WTIM and NCAP on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee networks). Two types of messages are defined: set and setRsp.The first one is used to send all kinds of data between devices, i.e., TEDS, sensor readings, the register readings, and others, while setRsp messages are used to confirm delivery of data packets and to identify potential errors during the communication process. During data reception several operations are performed (unpacking, error checking and messages defragmentation) before it can be handled by the IEEE 1451.0 layer. When a WTIM sends a message, this layer is responsible for the generation of the appropriate response, i.e., receive data from the lower layer (IEEE 1451.0) and execute the processes needed for it to be sent to the NCAP in the correct format, ensuring their delivery to the recipient. Fig. 6 illustrates the simplified state machine of the sMPWiNodeZ application, illustrating the relationship between IEEE 1451 states, IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee management and power management. After hardware initialization, it is necessary to search for an IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network and connect to its coordinator. Afterwards, all IEEE 1451 layers can be initiated in the state WTIMinitialization. During this state, the IEEE 1451.0 and IEEE 1451.5 services are configured and all existing TC are checked and added to the data structure of the IEEE 1451.0 layer. This process involves the initialization of the state registers, attributes, as well as reading and verification of the TEDS for all WTIM’s and their TC. In its normal operation, the WTIM periodically comes out from WTIMSleep state, checks the available energy and if passed it goes to the WTIMActive state during which the sMPWiNodeZ can receive command messages from the NCAP. The TC associated with each sensor uses a free running sampling mode and the data transmission mode has been set to streaming at fixed intervals. This configuration enables the autonomous sending of readings to the NCAP at regular intervals, without the need for any NCAP polling. If requests from the NCAP are pending, these are processed as soon as the WTIM enters its active state. 4.4 The iPAGAT gateway and NCAP services We consider the iPAGAT to be the key element of the proposed architecture in Fig. 2, since it performs a set of in-field operations and manages simultaneously a set of devices for heterogeneous data gathering. As such, in addition to all the services needed to create a distributed IEEE 1451 system, the iPAGAT implements a set of additional services available to level 3, referred to, in this work, as the farm management level. The iPAGAT can be remotely accessed through the services provided by its embedded data integration system for gateway management, WSN monitoring and configuration. In addition, it provides access to IEEE 1451 NCAP services, such as WTIM discovery, TEDS management, transducer access, transducer management and WSN collected data. The data integration system also enables data queries to the NCAP data as well as iPAGAT aggregated data. It is also possible to monitor each WSN node including traffic, link quality indicator, and available energy using NCAP services. The NCAP was implemented in Java programming language and has been structured into three main components: Network Communication (NC), Transducer Services Interface (TSI) and Module Communication Interface (MCI). The functional architecture is shown in Fig. 7 . The NC component provides a set of services used for communication between any network/external applications and the NCAP. This access can be accomplished by one of three methods (IEEE 1451.1 API, IEEE 1451.0 HTTP Protocol or Smart Transducers Web Services). The method described in IEEE 1451.1 subset defines an object model with a network-neutral interface for connecting processors to communication networks, sensors, and actuators. The TSI component contains the services and methods defined in the IEEE 1451.0 allowing full interoperability at data level. In the application, the class TranducerServicesInterface implements the services TransducerAcess, WTIMDiscovery, TEDSManager, TransducerManager and CommManager allowing a full interaction with WTIM, TC and TEDS. The component MCI implements all IEEE 1451.5 services being constituted by the classes: ModuleCommunicationsInterface, NetTwoWayClient, NetOneWaySubscriber and NetOneWayPublisher. The ModuleCommunicationsInterface class implements the interfaces NetComm, NetRegistration, NetReceive and holds a current list of NCAP’s registered WTIM and their properties. NetTwoWayClient class is used for bidirectional communications initiated by NCAP, while NetOneWaySubsciber and NetOneWayPublisher classes are used in one-way communication between WTIM and NCAP and vice-versa. At a lower level, ZigBeeCommModule and RS232 classes performs the interface with the IEEE802.15.4/ZigBee WSN coordinator. The ZigBeeCommModule class checks for the arrival of new messages and their validity. It is also responsible for managing the WSN coordinator and processing incoming messages, while managing pending ones. The use of ZigBeeCommModule class allows greater independence between the MCI component and radio technology adopted. The RS232 class consists of two separate processes responsible for receiving and sending messages to and from the WSN coordinator through an RS232 serial interface. In Section 5, these events are illustrated. Fig. 8 illustrates a simplified view of the state machine regarding the implementation of all IEEE 1451 services in the iPAGAT. When it starts, the NCAP obtains its initial settings stored in the iPAGAT database (MCI type, max number of TIMs, MCI and TSI name descriptions, etc.). IEEE 1451.1 and IEEE 1451.0 services are then initiated as well as the IEEE 1451.5 communications module. After initiation of the network coordinator and registering of the NCAP communications module, the ZigBee PAN network is ready to accept new network elements. After the registration of the communications module, it becomes active and waits for new WTIM announcements. In this case, the NCAP is notified of a registration request by the ZigBee stack which is responsible for assigning an address to the new WTIM. When processing the registration request, the NCAP query the iPAGAT database to validate the WTIM and proceeds to the WTIM registration by requesting all TEDS in the WTIM to identify all the channels and associated units. Whenever the WTIM announcement event is generated by a reconnection, NCAP checks whether the WTIM had any TC in the operate state proceeding to its activation automatically. The services provided by the IEEE 1451.1 API allows sending commands and TEDS for the WTIM and the reception of TEDS from the WTIM. In order to ensure faultless operation, the NCAP and the sink node are monitored by a service module (NCAP maintenance) at regular time intervals. The simplified data model for supporting the entire structure of IEEE 1451 data is divided by functional group: data tables and WSN management tables (subdivided into monitoring and configuration). The data collected by the WSN are stored in a table called sensordata. This table encapsulates the values, in SI units, the associated geographical and temporal context and a field used to index the measurement units. This table feeds the iPAGAT data aggregation engine comprising a local 7-day long WSN data warehouse available through the data integration system. A table called aggdata stores the last sensor reading, time stamps, the maximum and minimum daily values, their ocurrence times, and the average daily value. More details can be found in Peres et al. (2011). The tables that belong to the management group allow the WSN manager to monitor and configure the network, providing the Management Information Base (MIB) for the entire integrated management platform. The monitoring table contains a snapshot of the network status at a given time (topology, packets sent and received, the battery voltage levels of each WTIM and the time stamp of the last connection). It allows the history of the network and its elements to be traced in time. An incidents table stores possible occurrences detected by the network manager (e.g. loss of connectivity of a WTIM). Monitoring group tables store dynamic information about the WSN manager. The configuration group comprises the ipagat, ncap, tims and channels tables. The configuration parameters of the iPAGAT, NCAP, deployed TIMs and their TC are stored here. The NCAP table includes all IEEE 1451 device properties, including the ZigBee coordinator configuration and MCI and TSI software modules. The TIM and TC tables characterize each data acquisition platform and its channels, including TEDS, IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network address, the geographical coordinates of each deployed TIM and the types of the sensors used per channel. 5 Experiments and results In this section we describe and discuss some of the experiments and results obtained with the system described, emphasizing the role of the mesh-type ZigBee WSN and its in-field gateway, in the light of the IEEE 1451 framework. The experimental setup has been deployed in the campus of the Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal, since May 2009. In reference to the present paper, it consists of six nodes, one of which is the NCAP (iPAGAT). The remaining nodes are WTIMs (sMPWiNodeZ). At the ZigBee network level, four devices operate as end-devices and one device as a router. Fig. 9 illustrates all devices in the WSN. The WTIMs were fitted with four TC sensors and four embedded TC actuators to configure the period of time between data acquisitions. The TC includes a temperature sensor LM50B, the battery voltage, the solar irradiance obtained through the solar panel and a channel used to transmit management data (battery voltage, Link Quality Indicator (LQI), bytes sent/received, parent and status bits) to the NCAP. In order for the sMPWiNodeZ platform to operate as a WTIM, we configured it with the appropriate MetaTEDS, XdcrName and PHYTEDS. For each of the TC, the corresponding ChanTEDS and XdcrName were also configured, with the help of the TEDSManager application (Matos et al., 2012). The management of the iPAGAT gateway or gateways (there can be one or several) and its components is performed remotely at the farm management layer (L3 in Fig. 2) using the Java application iPAGATRemoteManager, which accesses the services provided by the gateway layer (WSNservices) and enables a set of management and data collection tasks (real-time monitoring, configuration, status and historical events). Tasks such as IEEE 1451 NCAP configuration, management zones or even selected variables used by the data aggregation engine (form frmIPAGATConfig) are performed within this application. Fig. 10 illustrates the general appearance of the application. The main window uses the frmTree form to display all elements of the integrated management platform. The data exchanged between the application and the selected iPAGAT is shown below that (frmCommunications). The WSN incidents are shown at the bottom (frmIncidents). The device tree, displayed in more detail in Fig. 10, allows an intuitive interaction with the iPAGAT, with the NCAP, WTIM and their TC as well as the several TEDS configured in WTIM and TC clearly visible. The monitoring of the WSN nodes uses a map as its central structuring element. The map provides a simple and intuitive interface to the WSN elements (iPAGAT and their WTIM). The logical connections between elements, summary information and status of each component (address, coordinates, etc.) are all represented and geo-referenced. It is also possible to observe traffic data between iPAGAT and each WTIM and display the battery voltage of each one as well as its LQI. The monitoring can be performed over a specified time period, but real-time monitoring is also possible. It is also possible to generate CSV (Comma Separated Values) reports to a file. All of these WTIM dynamic data monitoring options are available using the interface shown in Fig. 11 . The interface frmTIMConfig shown in Fig. 12 , allows full WTIM/TC configuration. In addition, some useful information is presented such as WTIM network address, location and date of the last connection, and TEDS/TC of selected WTIM. It is also possible to display all mandatory IEEE 1451.0 (MetaTEDS, XdcrName, ChanTEDS) and IEEE 1451.5 (PHYTEDS) TEDS. There is an additional feature that we have found useful: it is possible to send TEDS for a specific WTIM and/or TC; activate (operate state) or deactivate (idle state) a specific channel, or even change the TC acquisition time period. In the case of sensors that may be added by the user to a sMPWiNodeZ platform, their TEDS and TC may be remotely configured using the iPAGATRemoteManager and downloaded to the WTIM through the network or be programmed through the TEDSManager tool. Two distinct transactions types between the NCAP and a WTIM may occur. The transmission of a command to each WTIM for configuration or actuation purposes is one type. The other type is the periodic transmission of acquired data by each WTIM, an important capability because it avoids the need for the NCAP to poll each WTIM in the network (as described by Higuera et al. (2009)). Fig. 13 illustrates in a precise way the timing of the sequence of operations needed to send a command from the NCAP to a WTIM following the IEEE 1451.0 specification. Examples of such remote configuration commands are WTIM configuration, calibration, enabling/disabling TC and setting acquisition period. For instance, in order to instruct a sensor to perform periodic readings, one simply needs to activate its TC by sending an operate command to the WTIM. Besides the associated TC/sensor, an embedded pair of virtual TC/actuator was created as an IEEE 1451.0 control group. This procedure enables the setting of the sampling acquisition period using the same procedure, i.e., by sending a command to the embedded virtual actuator where the parameter is the desired time period. This is an important improvement because it normalizes all WSN related procedures, an important step towards interoperability. Once configured, the TC proceeds to trigger sensor readings at periodic time intervals and sends each sample value to the NCAP without any need for polling. The diagram in Fig. 14 illustrates the process of receiving a new sensor data from the WTIM. Once received, decoded and processed by the several NCAP modules, data are stored in the iPAGAT database through the module WSNmanager. The command/response pairs and message formats are described in Fig. 15 as an example when a temperature sensor connected to a WTIM sends data with a sampling interval set to 300s. The first three pairs describe WTIM configuration operations and the last one illustrates the transmission of the sensor reading to the NCAP. If the sensor is associated with channel 1 (TC) of the WTIM, then, to start collecting data, the corresponding TC must be activated, that is, placed in the operate state. To change the state of the TC, a sequence of events must take place. Among other functions, this allows switching on and off the sensor, define the period of time between readings, and, in the case of an actuator, to change its output status. These sequences of events clearly show that normalization of the command sending procedures and data reception by all network elements is an enormous advantage that follows from the application of the IEEE 1451 family of standards. The implementation of TC in the WTIM considerably simplifies the tasks of designing, implementing and managing heterogeneous sensor networks, such as those used in PA/PV. The implementation of the NCAP as part of iPAGAT made available all of its services and potential. An example is the iPAGAT alarm or warning system. We explored it to implement a message service that allows the automatic sending of e-mail reports about the iPAGAT activities. This may include issues reported by the 1451 subsystem or ZigBee. Fig. 16 illustrates two such warning messages: one is triggered when the iPAGAT is powered up, the other is when the communication with a WTIM is lost. 6 Discussion The IEEE 1451 family of standards is very comprehensive but also very complex, a fact that has not always helped to make it quickly and widely adopted. However, despite the perceived complexity of these standards, they do provide a number of important advantages which make the implementation effort worthwhile. We have already discussed some of the IEEE 1451 advantages in the context of PA/PV. The authors have a long term interest in PA/PV, mainly targeted to the Douro region in the Northeast of Portugal, one of the oldest (if not the oldest) demarcated wine-producing regions in Europe. The unique characteristics of the region, the technical challenges set by PA/PV and its important benefits (environmental, economical, etc.) have made our task both difficult and interesting. This article is one in a series of works that the group has carried out (Morais et al., 2008a,b; Cunha et al., 2010; Peres et al., 2011). The technological solutions that we have described provide added value in PA/PV, particularly in reference to the study of variability in PA/PV practices. We have considered topics ranging from power issues (energy harvesting, power management, etc.) to networking issues (overall architecture, software, hardware). More recently, increasingly aware of the complexity and costs hidden in the deployment, management and maintenance of heterogeneous WSN, we came to appreciate normalized procedures that could simplify these tasks. This work is considered by its authors as the first practical, full IEEE 1451 application in PA/PV and a privileged framework under which new applications can be easily tried. As far as we know, this is the first time that the IEEE 1451 standards are incorporated in already existing devices, as a way of creating an open framework for interoperability. Although analog sensors are not intrinsically compatible with the IEEE 1451 standards, the combination iPAGAT/NCAP allows the creation of smart, easy-to-configure systems. Each wireless data acquisition platform becomes a sensor node (WTIM) with a smart TC, replacing multiple isolated sensors. The addition or removal of sensors or actuators in a totally automatic way is still limited by the WTIM hardware, but with products in which sensors are already embedded, the entire configuration process can proceed according to the IEEE 1451 standard. This allows for the development of software components (drivers) for sensor networks. As a result of the lessons learned from this work, we are now considering the specification of an interface of reconfigurable hardware under the command of the WTIM, which might allow the connection of an analog sensor and the remote configuration of the system for its incorporation. 7 Conclusions One of the conclusions that can be extracted from our study is that IEEE 1451 is powerful when correctly integrated in devices that acquire, store and process heterogeneous data. The incorporation of IEEE 1451 services in the data acquisition devices allows the use of TEDS in all sensors, significantly simplifying the configuration procedures. The selection, at the NCAP level, of the sensors associated with each WTIM is enough to make “plug-and-play” a reality. In our implementation, we have found that the module that interacts with the transducers is very important. It complements the work very well since it allows the automatic configuration of the interfaced devices. Depending on the TEDS of the transducer, the hardware of the acquisition platform can be configured to accommodate the selected sensor. We have found that this property is particularly useful and important, given the wide range of output types that sensors in PA/PV may exhibit. Another important conclusion extracted from this work is that a full implementation of the complex set of IEEE 1451 standards is possible for WSN based on 802.11, 802.15.4, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and 6LoWPAN as cited in the references, but may be difficult for today’s ultra-low power embedded system technology. This may change in the near future as the technology evolves. However, the standardization is still crucial for the management of heterogeneous data. The simplicity in handling the data collected by WSN that support IEEE 1451 over IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee networks shows very clearly that the IEEE 1451 family of standards is very well suited to the universe of PA/PV and to meet its needs.

Despite the benefits of precision agriculture and precision viticulture production systems, its rate of adoption in the Portuguese Douro Demarcated Region remains low. We believe that one way to raise it is to address challenging real-world problems whose solution offers a clear benefit to the viticulturist. For example, one of the most demanding tasks in wine making is harvesting. Even for humans, the environment makes grape detection difficult, especially when the grapes and leaves have a similar color, which is generally the case for white grapes. In this paper, we propose a system for the detection and location, in the natural environment, of bunches of grapes in color images. This system is able to distinguish between white and red grapes, and at the same time, it calculates the location of the bunch stem. The system achieved 97% and 91% correct classifications for red and white grapes, respectively. Keywords Grape detection Visual inspection Precision viticulture Image processing 1 Introduction Variable management practices within the field according to site-specific conditions can be promoted through the concept of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Precision Viticulture (PV). It is based on new tools and information sources provided by modern technologies, such as yield monitoring devices, soil, plant and pest sensors and remote sensing [3]. PA and PV generally have two main objectives: to render the production more cost-effective and to reduce its environmental impact. The first objective can be achieved by reducing production costs and improving productivity. The second objective relates to the accuracy and the ability to control the application of production factors, such as chemicals, which should be done within a fair measure of the real needs of crops. The rate of adoption of these technological tools varies considerably from country to country, and from region to region [23]. In addition to environmental benefits, such as those related to better water and nutrient management, PA and PV systems can increase worker productivity, augment product throughput and improve selection reliability and uniformity. Additionally, the use of robotic systems in agriculture has seen a sharp increment in recent years. Many systems have been described for the automation of various harvesting processes, such as for fruit location, detachment and transfer, among other, [22]. They have been used in the harvesting of, for example, melons [11], cucumbers [12], tomatoes [16] and oranges [18]. For a survey of several aspects of these systems see, for example, [14] and [20]. According to the report of the US Department of Energy [1], the wine industry is interested in using autonomous robotic systems for grape harvesting, phytosanitary treatments, among other very time and human resources consuming tasks, for multiple reasons; this also happens to be true for the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) of Portugal, as explained below. Harvesting conditions, in particular, affect wine quality, and several techniques need to be used in order to produce quality wines, and including scheduling details [2], and ending up with production details [15]. Soft computing methods and techniques have been used in virtually all fields of science. They have been successfully applied to the detection of lifetime building thermal insulation failures [21], neural visualization of network traffic data for intrusion detection [8], identification of typical meteorological days [6], enhanced data visualization [7], to name only a few. Visual inspection methods can also be used to locate grapes for harvesting. Unfortunately, the location process is much easier for fruits than for vine grapes (see, for example, [19]), even if soft computing techniques like the ones listed above are used. The environment makes grape detection difficult even for humans, especially when the grapes and leafs have similar colors, as is the case for white grapes. To an automatic recognition application, the grapes can appear at different scales, they can be partially hidden by leafs, the luminance of images can vary widely due to the sun, clouds, leafs, and so on. We have tried different pattern recognition techniques in order to try to solve these problems. Many works have been devoted to the definition of object invariant descriptors for simple geometric transformations; see, for example, [13]. The Zernike moments [5] have been developed to overcome the major drawbacks of regular geometrical moments regarding noise effects and image quantization error. Zernike moments were successfully used in the detection of red grapes [4], but nothing is known about their performance in connection with white grapes. Moreover, besides the difficulties associated with the calculation of the Zernike moments, the method proposed by [4] implies two distinct phases, training and recognition, the training phase being crucial to the results of the whole system. The computation time for the learning step, for 17 images, is reported to take 5 minutes on a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4. The computation time for the recognition step (identification of each block of size 16 × 16 pixels) takes less than one second. We have tried to use Zernike moments to detect white grapes but the results were disappointing (less than 50% of correct classifications). In this paper we present a simple method for the detection and location, in natural environment, of bunches of grapes in color images, using only very simple and basic image processing techniques. The system is able to distinguish between white and red grapes, and also to work at night (with very little, or none, light/brightness variation). Additionally, the system can calculate the location of the bunch stem, which can be used to help guiding a harvesting robot. The system presented here represents part of an effort that is being made by our team to help introducing PA and PV in the farmersʼ everyday practices in the DDR [17], and is intended to be used in an autonomous harvesting robotic system. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present the DDR unique characteristics, which definitely shaped and constrained the system. Section 3 is used to present the proposed system. Its performance and efficiency are discussed in Section 4, where experimental results obtained with real images are given. Section 5 presents some conclusions and discusses future work. 2 The DDR unique characteristics and their impact on the system The DDR is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the oldest Wine Demarcated Region of the World, where Port wine is actually produced and then shipped to the city of Oporto. Due to its unique characteristics, it poses very specific challenges, mainly connected with its topographic profile, pronounced climatic variations and complex soil characteristics. It is located in northeast Portugal, and consists mostly of steep hills (slopes reaching 15%) and narrow valleys that flatten out into plateaux above 400 m. The Douro river dug deeply into the mountains to form its bed, and the dominant element of the landscape are the vineyards, planted in terraces fashioned from the steep rocky slopes and supported by hundreds of kilometers of drystone wall. Vineyards in the DDR are characterized by their small area size, and by having more than one caste per parcel and even for bard, particularly in the case of old vines. The more recent vines were projected and organized having in mind better control of the number and type of castes. Still, more than 120 (both white and red grapes) different castes are used in the region. Grape harvest and disease predictions, as well as the assessment of the grape value, are currently left to the grape-growers, without the help of decision-support mechanisms, in an environment where no significant irrigation systems exist. Traditionally, vineyards have been harvested by humans. However, harvesting is a hard work, particularly in a region with the topographic and climatic characteristics of the DDR. The manpower needs are large and it is more and more difficult to find qualified workers. Autonomous systems could not only reduce the harvesting cost and manpower needs but they could also be conceived to work during the night. There is however one important constraint: although it is not essential that the workpower of the harvesting robot surpasses that of a human, it is crucial that they satisfy quality control levels at least similar to those achieved by humans. Also, the existing machines harvest grapes by striking the vine, a process that is not recommended for some wines, such as champagne, for chemical reasons (e.g., oxidation) but also because of some deposits being collected with the grapes. These harvesting machines need, at least, one operator. They also require previous preparation of the vineyard, such as cutting the tips. By contrast, the system presented in this paper is intended to be used in an autonomous robotic system, without previous preparation of the vineyard, which helps to keep the cost of the solution down to a minimum. It is part of an effort made by our team to help introducing or spreading PA and PV in the farmersʼ everyday practices in the DDR [9,17]. We wanted a system able to work during the night, with very little, or none, light/brightness variation. We also wanted the system to distinguish red from white grapes, because in the DDR red and white grapes are commonly found in the same parcel and even the same bard, and therefore telling one from the other is essential for correct harvesting. 3 The grape recognition system We came to realize early in our work that if we could solve the problem of detecting bunches of white grapes we could also solve the problem of detecting red grapes. The reasons will become clear from the results section. Consequently, we have focused our efforts on the detection of bunches of white grapes. For the reasons explained in the previous section, we wanted the whole system to be able to work at night (i.e., in the darkness, with very little, or none, light/brightness variations), and also have the ability to distinguish between red and white grapes. To this end, the system simply makes a first pass through the original (night captured) image, counting the number of pixels that are “inside” limits of the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) components of ( 044 , 051 , 064 ), ( 033 , 041 , 054 ), ( 055 , 062 , 075 ), and ( 018 , 024 , 036 ), for red grapes, and ( 102 , 108 , 089 ), ( 095 , 104 , 085 ), ( 076 , 090 , 078 ), and ( 083 , 089 , 038 ) for white grapes. These four central values (colors) were experimentally (trial and error) determined during the development phase. The system looks for pixels within the “limits” of these central values: the default limit contains all the values within 8% of these central values for red grapes and 15% for white grapes (these were the values experimentally determined from the night captured images). The largest counts indicate the type of grape, i.e., red or white. However, if initial conditions are known, i.e., if we know that a parcel consists of a single type of grape (say white), then the system can be switched to that type of grape mode (say white mode), skipping the grape identification phase. Most vineyards in the DDR have small areas, and, as said before, they may also contain more than one type of grape (red or white and even different castes) per parcel and even per bard, particularly in the case of old vines. Once the type of grape (red or white) is established, the system follows three additional steps: color mapping, morphological dilation, black areas and stem detection. The color mapping step is done based on the conditions established during the grape identification step. At the end of this step we will have a binary image (black for the pixels in the range and white for the other pixels). Fig. 1 (a) shows the original image, containing bunches of red grapes, and Fig. 1(b) presents the resulting image of the application of color mapping step. The resulting image from this step does not generally have a uniform (continuous) black region, see Fig. 1(b), but several regions, where the concentration of black pixels is greater. The morphological dilation operation is meant to fill in the gaps between the pixels, yielding uniform black regions. We have used a square of 3 × 3 pixels as the structuring element, typically one of the most simple and used structuring elements. We should recall that the shape of this structuring element is not very far from the shape of a grape berry. Because the regions resulting from the color mapping step when applied to red grapes and white grapes are very different, with a greater sparsity when dealing with white grapes, we have typically used 60 iterations of the morphological dilation for red grapes, and 100 iterations for white grapes. Fig. 2 (a) shows the resulting image after the dilation operation, applied to the image presented in Fig. 1(b). Obviously, we have tried different sizes for the structuring element, but when its size was increased, even with a lower number of morphological dilation iterations, the number of overlapping uniform black regions tends to increase; these overlaps will correspond to incorrect overlapping bunches, leading to incorrect identifications. The final step is used to detect and numbering the black regions, and locate the bunch stem. First, the number of contiguous regions are counted and labeled (numbered) using 8-connectivity. Then, for each region, its width, height and area are calculated (in pixels) so that we can discard false detections of very small bunches or very large regions to contain only one bunch of grapes. Note that in this last case the region will be composed of two or more bunches and the system will need to capture more images (from different angles) to correctly handle these situations. Now, these parameters, and also the total number of admissible areas, are all adjustable. Next, we count the number of regions, center, area, width, height, perimeter and boundaries, for each region. For each region, and based on the pixel distribution and density around its center, it is determined the “horizontal” (width) and “vertical” (height) axes of the bunch, i.e., the bunch orientation. Then, with these axes (and orientation), and with the regionʼs limits, we locate the bunch stem. Fig. 2(b) shows the resulting image after the final step and Fig. 3 shows another example consisting of the original image and the resulting identification. 4 Results and discussion All images presented here and used to test the system were captured during the night, with a Panasonic FZ28 camera simply using its internal flash, i.e., no other lightning system was used. By capturing the images during the night we avoid any spurious reflections or bad illumination during sunny day time, like momentary presence of clouds, but also, as explained above, some important wine chemical properties (e.g., oxidation). In total, there were 190 images containing bunches of white grapes, and 35 images of red grapes (the number of images containing bunches white grapes is much higher than that of red grapes because the identification of bunches of red grapes is much simpler, as explained above). A summary of the results can be seen in Table 1 . As we can see, there were 172 correct results for bunches of white grapes; this means that all bunches present in each of these 172 images were correctly identified. We emphasize this fact, because we want that in a near future this system can be part of a harvesting robot, and we know that most of the infield images captured by this robot could contain more than one bunch per image, which clearly is not an optimal situation, but rather real. Recall that in a practical infield situation the robot can take as many images as needed to ensure that no more bunches are present for harvesting. However, we also have 18 images with incorrect or false detections. This means that the system classified some areas of the image as if they were bunches although no bunches at all were present, or missed the identification of an existing bunch. Also, if two regions were merged during the morphological dilation process they were counted as an “incorrect” result. As we have foreseen, the systemʼs performance, in percentage, is better for bunches of red grapes than for white grapes. Recall that the color of red grapes is very different (contrasting) from their surroundings (e.g., color of the leaves); however one must note the small number of red grape sample images. The system can also be used to help guiding the robot. As it can be seen in Fig. 4 , although the picture was captured very far way form the grape bunches the system manages to identify the presence of bunches of grapes. So, the system can help to tell the robot to move along that direction, adjusting (fine tuning) its position or trajectory. Usually, the presence of many bunches of grapes in one image indicates that the robot is at a considerably far distance from those bunches. Obviously, this can only be a contribution to the robotʼs trajectories or positioning. In the examples of Figs. 5 and 6 , for example, we can see that the bunch in the center of the figure is correctly identified. However, we can see that there are more bunches to be harvested. By capturing one more image after the harvesting of the central bunch the system will detect the presence of more bunches and then correct the robots trajectory, as in the previous situation. As noted before, the presence of leaves may (partially) occlude a bunch; in these cases a mechanic system like the one presented in [10], basically a blower/fan to remove leaves, can be used to help solve this problem. We have tested the system on a computer running Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, with an Intel Core Duo Processor T2300 at 1.66 GHz, Mobile Intel 945 PM Express Chipset, 3 GB DDR2 667 MHz SDRAM, and NVDIA GeForce Go 7300 External 128 MB VRAM video card. In order to reduce the identification time, we tested several image resolutions, as presented in Table 2 . With a resolution of 1.3 megapixel (MP) the system is able to produce the same results as with a 10 megapixel resolution. Note that the identification of bunches of red grapes takes less time, because it uses a lower number of iterations during the dilation operation step. 5 Conclusions and ongoing work Within the context of precision agriculture/viticulture, and because the Douro Demarcated Region has its own very particular characteristics, a vision inspection system was developed in order to identify bunches of grapes, for later inclusion in a robotic system for night conditions harvesting. The system is also able to automatically distinguish between white and red grapes, and has achieved 97% and 91% of correct classifications, for red and white grapes, respectively. Additionally, it can also calculate the location of the bunch stem, and can be used to help the robotʼs location and guiding system. Concerning the identification algorithm we are trying to make it more flexible. For example, during the morphological dilation step, the number of iterations should depend on the merging of the different regions, i.e., the iteration process should stop if the regions are already contiguous or if two distinct regions are merged. Also, the tilling and distribution of these contiguous regions should be analyzed in order to prevent incorrect identifications, like two or more staked regions, regions with much greater width than wight, among other. Obviously, a dedicated (specific) lighting system may help in producing better identification results (starting with a simple diffuser), but it would also increase the system cost and needed resources (e.g., power supply). We are also currently testing multi-spectral cameras. This solution is far more expensive, but it could bring information about grapes maturation and alcoholic level. A cheaper alternative may include infra-red cameras, but red grapes yield more thermal information than white grapes, and so, once again, the identification of red grapes seems simpler than white grapes. In addition to the tasks of detection and harvesting, the robotic system may also contribute to mitigate the environmental impact of chemical plant protection products, as its application by robotic systems would be made only at points of interest identified by the vision system, among other possible applications (pruning, trimming the vines, disease detection, etc.).

In particular, a key problem is the recognition of hyperlinks by a specific group of people, namely those with intellectual disabilities. Materials and Methods: This experiment investigated a methodology based on the direct observation, video recording, interview and data obtained by an eye tracker device. Ten participants took part in this study. They were divided into two groups and asked to perform two tasks: 'Sing a song' and 'Listen to a story' in two websites. These websites were developed to include specific details. The first website presented an image navigation menu (INM), whereas the other one showed a text navigation menu (TNM). Results: There was a general improvement regarding the participants' performance when using INMs. Conclusion: The referred analysis indeed shows that not only did these specific participants gain a better understanding of the demanding task, but also they showed an improved perception concerning the content of the navigation menu that included hyperlinks with images. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",

Actually, vibration-powered generators are the most appropriate mechanisms for this kind of application's environment. This paper describes the first attempt to develop the concept of energy harvesting from multiple energy sources applied in the same hip implant. Exploiting the potential of the three angular movements over the femoral component, namely in the abduction-adduction, flexion-extension and inward-outward rotation axes, three inboard vibration-based mechanisms were developed in order to ensure electric power supply from multiple energy sources. A total of 53.7 μJ/s was harvested by a translation movement-based electromagnetic energy generator when a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 40 mm and a frequency of 4 Hz was applied. A rotation movement-based electromagnetic energy generator has harvested 0.77 μJ/s when a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 60° and a frequency of 2.5 Hz was used. The piezoelectric energy harvester has achieved 0.6 μJ/s with the application of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 200 N and a frequency of 4 Hz. Besides, its ability of being fully autonomous, operating without expiry and maintenance, while offering safety during its entire lifetime are relevant features. This paper should provide the basis for the development of smart hip prosthesis with the ability to fix the aseptic implant loosening problem.",

Keywords: MEMS; Piezoresistive; Pressure Sensor; Flat Membrane Design 1. Introduction To develop a silicon micro-machined piezoresistive pressure sensor with a measurement span of 1MPa and capable to withstand peak pressures of 10MPa, a membrane design with a small ratio between edge length and thickness is necessary. Such a membrane is commonly fabricated by the bulk micromachining of silicon wafers, being its dimensions forged by the wet etching process. Membrane designs with a central mass, bossed membrane, due to its smaller deflections and to the possibility to have sensing * Corresponding author. Tel.: +351-244820300; fax: +351-244820310.

Ferreira et al. / Procedia Engineering 47 ( 2012 ) 1307 â€“ 1310 elements subjected to similar, absolute value and shape, but of opposite value mechanical stresses (sensitivities), results in designs with improved linearity. However, such designs are very difficult to realize (convex corners, deep etching distances and small distances between convex and concave corners) and are highly affected by the tolerances of the wet etch process, resulting in a device with low sensitivity and high sensitivity variations among fabricated samples. For the above presented reasons flat membrane designs are preferred. In flat membrane designs the main causes for nom linearity are; the nonlinear relation between applied pressure and mechanical stress (related to the membrane dimensions and displacement) and the sensitivity matching of the sensing piezoresistors in the Wheatstone bridge [1,2]. In low range pressure sensors, Fig. 1.(a), sensing elements are undoubtedly placed inside the membrane area, near to its edges, where the sensitivity is higher [2,3]. More reservations arise for designs in the medium and high pressure ranges, Fig. 1.(b), with a low ratio between membrane area and thickness, where the same practice is debatable. Commonly, sensing piezoresistors, especially the ones placed perpendicular to the nearest membrane edge, are also divided in multiples to improve their overall exposition to the mechanical stress (sensor sensitivity) [4]. Furthermore, the present work optimizes the position of the sensing piezoresistors considering the variations in the membrane dimensions, due to fabrication tolerances, for a compromise between sensitivity and sensitivity variations. (a) (b) Fig. 1. Characteristic equivalent stress on the surface of a membrane with: (a) thickness given by the n-type epitaxial layer and area set by the diffused n-well layer; (b) thickness given by n-type layers and area defined by the bulk etch of the silicon wafer. 2. Sensor Design The SensoNor Multi-Project wafer service MultiMEMS was selected for the design and fabrication of the presented sensor. The MultiMEMS dice, made of one silicon wafer and two glass wafers (anodic bonded), have enough strength to cope with the pressure requirements. Considering that silicon single- crystal and polysilicon have a fracture strength not less than 1GPa [5], a membrane with a thickness of 23.1Î¼m and a nominal area of 400Ã—400Î¼m 2 was selected. The membrane cavity is formed by the wet etch of the silicon wafer p-substrate, until the n-type implanted region N-WELL (electrochemical etch stop), which, given the MultiMEMS process tolerances, results in a membrane with the minimal and maximum dimensions of 378Ã—378Î¼m 2 and 433Ã—433Î¼m 2 , respectively. Such a membrane design guarantees a maximum equivalent stress of 768MPa for a pressure of 10MPa (case of maximum area; 433Ã—433Î¼m 2 ), and a linearity of 0.086% between applied pressure and mechanical stress in the 0 â€“ 1MPa range. Fig. 2. shows the finite element analysis results for the equivalent stress and the difference between the transversal and longitudinal stresses, â€œTran. - Long.â€�, on the membrane surface. The â€œTran. - Long.â€� curve is an indicator of the sensitivity of a piezoresitor placed longitudinal to the nearest membrane edge, likewise, the inverse curve is an indicator of the sensitivity of a piezoresistor placed transversally to the nearest membrane edge. As shown the proposed design presents its maximum sensitivity at the membrane 1309 C. Ferreira et al. / Procedia Engineering 47 ( 2012 ) 1307 â€“ 1310 edges. The sensitivity out of the membrane area is a result of the membrane edge length to thickness ratio and of the membrane cavity etched with 54.74Âº to the wafer surface. Indeed, the sensitivity peaks amplitude and position shifts with the membrane size, resulting in quite large variations of the sensitivity at a given point on the membrane surface (scenarios for the nominal, minimum and maximum membrane dimensions are shown in Fig. 3.(a) - grey curves). Fig. 3.(a) also shows the curve for the minimum sensitivity, guaranteed worst case value, considering the variations in the membrane area. Similarly, a tolerance indicator was found as the largest difference between all sensitivity curves. Finally, the curve â€œSensitivity - Toleranceâ€� results from the weighting of both previous measures. From this analysis, the point at 4.035Î¼m from the membrane edge (towards its center) was found to be the best compromise between high sensitivity and low sensitivity variations, and was used for the center point of all piezoresistors used in pressure sensing. A Wheatstone bridge of surface piezoresistors (with positive and negative sensitivity to pressure) is used to maximize the sensor sensitivity while reducing its temperature sensitivity. Since all piezoresistors are at the same temperature, the temperature coefficients of resistivity are eliminated. A temperature sensing element made of a piezoresistor was also added to the sensor die to compensate the pressure (a) (b) Fig. 2. Equivalent stress on the membrane surface (@ 1MPa pressure) and sensitivity indicator, â€œTran. - Long.â€�, for a piezoresitor placed longitudinal to the nearest membrane edge: (a) over a line passing at the membrane center; (b) along the membrane edges.

Ferreira et al. / Procedia Engineering 47 ( 2012 ) 1307 â€“ 1310 sensor output of the temperature coefficients of piezoresistivity. Moreover, for improved sensitivity and linearity, given the asymmetry of the stress curves (Fig. 2.), piezoresistors placed transversal to the nearest membrane edge were divided in two (Fig. 3.(b)), so that their mean sensitivity matches the one of the piezoresistors placed longitudinally to the nearest membrane edge. 3. Results Upon fabricated, twelve sensor dice, chosen randomly from the delivered samples, were tested. The dice (fitted in TO8 packages) were placed inside a pressurized chamber, being used an AFRISO Â® DIN 10 gauge as pressure reference. Air was used for testing, with absolute pressures ranging from 0.01MPa to 1MPa. The sensor output was acquired with an acquisition board coupled with amplification electronics. The test results at room temperature (25ÂºC) for the twelve sensor dice characterized gave a mean sensitivity of 30.9mV/V/MPa with a standard deviation of 0.65mV/V/MPa and a linearity error of 0.15% of the scale span. Some samples of the presented sensor were also tested, installed in a specifically developed package, with pressures up to 10MPa keeping its characteristics and performance steady. 4. Conclusions Considering its specifications, the pressure sensor presented achieved a very satisfactory sensitivity, which makes its use in lower pressure ranges also possible. Sensitivity variations are mainly caused by the micromachining tolerances for the membrane dimensions. Even so, a satisfactory standard deviation in sensitivity of the tested dice equal to 0.021MPa/MPa proves that the use of a 23.1Î¼m thick membrane, with lower fabrication accuracy (dimensions are defined by the wet etching of the silicon wafer and not by the implanted layers), is practicable. Test results confirmed the high linearity of the presented sensor, which reflects the work done in the positioning and distribution of piezoresistors on the membrane surface. Moreover, the membrane design, with a small edges length to thickness ratio, also contributed for the high linearity between the applied pressure and the mechanical stress. Overall, the sensor design performed very satisfactory. High linearity and an acceptable compromise between sensitivity and sensitivity variations were achieved, while being capable to withstand pressures up to 10MPa.

Keywords: Energy harvesting; power management; wireless communications 1. Introduction More and more energy harvesting solutions are being presented as the natural way of powering devices that are ubiquitous in the environment as biomedical implants. As they become more efficient when converting energy, more electrical energy becomes available which widens a range of functions that a smart implant can implement. Itâ€™s now possible energize systems that make use of LR-WPAN protocols, such as Bluetooth low energy protocol, a possible solution to connect a biomedical device to create a Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBAN) [1], which opens a wider range of new implementations not possible before. Nevertheless, and since energy is not always present or abundant, any chunk of energy must be harvested and preserved so it can be made available when needed. Efficient power management systems are then essential, especially in systems that make use of harvested energy through micro-power generators such as smart implants. This paper describes a power conditioning architecture used to convert multiple energy sources to suffice a smart hip prosthesis power need.

System overview and power management system The smart prosthesis implant is composed by 4 main modules: an acquisition and data processing module with RF communication capability, an activation circuit [2], an energy harvesting module, and the power management module, all schematically described in Fig. 1 (a). The electronics of the implantable system was redesigned from previous versions [2], introducing the use of a multi-sourced micro-power generators scheme and a Bluetooth low energy System-on-Chip (SoC) solution for data acquisition and communications. With this solution, the smart hip prosthesis can now establish a low-power, low-range wireless communication with other Bluetooth v4 compliant devices such as iPhone 4S. (a) (b) Fig. 1 (a) System overview; (b) Power conditioning module architecture As depicted in Fig. 1 (b), the power conditioning system was developed so it can manage the energy provided by some already installed micro-power generators. Each generator has its own power conditioning sub-module in order to optimize the efficiency of each energy harvester. Any active generator contributes to the fulfilling of a main energy reservoir. An energy level monitor is permanently monitoring the energy level of the storage element and when it reaches a pre-established high level its energy is delivered to the load through an ultra low-power and low dropout, voltage regulator. When the stored energy decreases below an also pre-established low voltage level, the energy level monitor restrains the use of the remaining energy. This procedure allows a faster recovery to ready state by avoiding the complete discharge of the reservoir element. It should be noted, as seen in Fig. 1 (b), that power management system can also retrieve energy from a power source that includes its own energy storage element. There are two main reasons to include this possibility: patient examination for extended periods and; when implant remote configuration is needed. In these cases, a constant, stable and without interruption, power source is required. However, this condition cannot be guaranteed since energy source is random in nature. In the presented architecture, this stable power source is achieved by the activation system which receives energy, by wireless means through an inductive link. 3. Micro-power generators In order to suffice the required power needs of the presented implantable system, three micro-power energy harvesting generators were developed and implemented inside a hip prosthesis (Fig. 2).Two of them are based in the electromagnetic principle [3] and the third one uses the piezoelectric effect [4]. The 724 N. Silva et al. / Procedia Engineering 47 ( 2012 ) 722 â€“ 725 electromagnetic generators make use of the available kinetic energy when the patient is in motion. The piezoelectric one makes use of the forces available on the head of the prosthesis. Fig. 2 Micro-power generators developed to work alongside the multi-purpose power management system The biggest generator, based in the translation movement, is placed in the body of the prosthesis. This generator was widely improved, Fig. 3 (a), from previous versions [5], and converts more the double of energy than the previous one, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). The main improvements are described in Fig. 3 (a). Currently this generator is being modeled using non-linear techniques [6] for further improvements. (a) (b) Fig. 3 (a) Improvement procedures to the translation based electromagnetic generator; (b) Comparison between generator versions The second generator is based in the rotational movement available in the head of the prosthesis. A set of magnets are embedded in the acetabulum and the coil is located inside the head of the prosthesis. The amplitude and angles of movement makes it possible to produce electrical energy yet in lower densities when compared with the previous generator. The third generator uses a piezoelectric transducer and is placed between the inferior half of the femoral head and the neck of the prosthesis. This generator also produces less energy than the one produced by the first electromagnetic generator. 4. Experimental results and discussion A prototype was developed (Fig. 2), in order to test the generator in use and the functionality of the power management system. As the electrical load, two different RF transmission modules were used: a MSP430 eZ430-RF2500 module and a BLE112A TM Bluetooth low energy SoC module from BlueGiga. The analysis of the results presented in figure 4 (a) proves that it is possible to energize such modules, with a constant voltage for over 100 seconds solely by using the energy produced by the generator. When using the energy from the activation circuit, Fig. 4 (b), the modules can be energized without interruption. 725 N.

Conclusion This paper has described a multi-purpose and multi-sourced power management system capable of supply energy to more power-demanding devices such as the ones that uses RF transceivers. Although with different energy densities, each generator contributes to recharge the main storage element, allowing better use of available energy and data transmission in a hypothetical scenario of a WBAN, created with implantable devices that use standards such as Bluetooth Low Energy. Each of the generators is being optimized for the types of movements that are exploited in energy conversion. The electromagnetic generator is being modeled using nonlinear techniques to further optimize energy conversion in low- frequency and low amplitude movements.

Introduction It is being considered that one of the best ways to power telemetric implants inside the human hip prostheses is converting energy from vibrations [1]. Following this approach, an electromagnetic micro- generator was developed [2], and it is currently being optimized by resizing the central inertial mass magnet and eliminating the suspension spring, which can be achieved placing the central magnet on magnetic levitation by means of the magnetic force provided by two smaller magnets positioned in the extremities of the Teflon tube (Fig. 1). The inertial mass rests due to the bottom magnet magnetic field. When in movement, the interaction between magnets introduces nonlinear behavior making the usual model [1,2] inaccurate. In order to properly model the generator, it is of the most importance to describe * Corresponding author. Tel.: +351 259 350372; fax: +351 259 350300. E-mail address: rmorais@utad.pt.

Fig. 1. 3D and geometrical representation of the generator. 2. Mathematical model We have started with a model describing the vibrational mechanics of the microgenerator presented in [2], and then an analytical expression for the resulting magnetic forces acting on the central magnet is proposed ( M F in Eq. 1), which introduces the magnets characteristics (size and magnetizations) [3], windings, friction and electric load. Recently, a cubic polynomial approximation for such force was reported but it can only be used for a particular microgenerator (with well specified characteristics) [4]. As depicted in Fig. 2, the cubic curve-fitting deviates from the analytic function making it inappropriate in this case. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the magnetic braking using the analytic function, not being the case for the cubic model. The analytic function predicts a greater velocity (Fig. 4) than the one predicted by the linear/cubic model, which may justify the better experimental results obtained in [2]. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it can be used to tune the main characteristics of an arbitrary microgenerator in order to achieve maximum performance. By using a generic non-harmonic external excitation, rather than Eq. 2, more complex input signals, as the ones describing the human gait, can be used to customize the characteristics of a specific microgenerator so it can work at its peak of performance regardless the idiosyncrasies of each patient. Electric load effects and windings electric resistance, as well as friction, are currently being included on the proposed model. Eq.1 is the simplified expression of the used model. Eq.2 is the usual expression for external excitation but in this work other inputs are being considered such as the one represented in Fig. 5. ),())(()()( tzmmgtx M Ftxctxm (1) )cos()( t m Ztz Z (2) 1091 M.

The mathematical model (1), (2) was solved using the NDSolve package of Mathematica. In our numerical experiments, we have only considered the values of the characteristics of the transducer that is currently being constructed and presented in Fig.1, namely: d = 0:0785m; J T = 0:31T; J M = 0:56T; J B = 0:42T; h T = 0:002m; h M = 0:024m; h B = 0:003m; r T = 0:002m; r M = 0:004m; r B = 0:003m; c = 0:005N=(m/s); m = 0:0044Kg; Z m = 0:020m. In particular we compare the solutions of our model with the solutions of the correspondent models in which the magnetic force is a linear one or a cubic polynomial approximation (see Figs. 2 and 3).

Conclusion This paper presented the first steps in the development of a complete mathematical model for a vibrational energy harvester. Although the behavior of the solutions is similar for low frequencies, it becomes quite different for high values of the frequency (in our numerical experiments we observe substancial differences for higher frequencies.

Conclusion This paper presented the first steps in the development of a complete mathematical model for a vibrational energy harvester. Although the behavior of the solutions is similar for low frequencies, it becomes quite different for high values of the frequency (in our numerical experiments we observe substancial differences for higher frequencies. This model also presents a major advantage: it is useful for optimizing such devices since it incorporates several specifications of the prototype. This study will be left for future work.

We present a nonlinear mathematical model for a low-size and micro-power vibrational energy harvester targeted to power smart prostheses and in particular hip prostheses. Constraints such as available volume, allowable total weight and energy transducer mechanism difficult the development of an optimal generator system, especially considering the low frequencies involved in the human gait. Since non-linear behavior often conducts to better experimental results than those obtained using linear models, a nonlinear model is being pursued to reduce the volume of the generator and maximize performance. By including the non-linear effects of magnetic levitation used to suspend the inertial mass, influence of friction and effects of inductor non-idealities, preliminary results indicate better generator's performance prediction which allows a more effective customization of the energy harvester.

Keywords Energy harvesting Hip prosthesis Biomedical implant Telemetry 1 Introduction Over the last four decades there has been a huge progress in low-voltage, low-power technologies, allowing the development of extremely low-power devices that can be mass produced at very low cost. This and the equally outstanding progress in wireless communications has contributed to the proliferation of electronic devices in virtually all human related activities. Most portable electronic devices are powered by batteries, which can be divided into two categories [1]: primary batteries, which are not rechargeable and as such must be replaced when their energy is exhausted; and secondary batteries, in which the transformation of chemical energy into electricity is reversible and therefore can be recharged and reused many times over. Although primary or secondary batteries provide an effective solution for many applications, there are also cases in which recharging or replacing batteries is simply impossible. As disparate examples we mention electronic equipment embedded in structures, such as bridges, and active implantable medical devices (AIMD). To deal with these and other similar applications, it becomes necessary to develop autonomous and sustainable energy sources. In the last decade considerable research has been done in order to develop devices which harvest energy from the environment of the application and converts it into usable electrical energy to energize electronic devices. A number of energy sources and transducers can be singled out: a) Biofuel Cells (BFC), which uses organic components, from within the human body for instance, as a way to produce enough electrical energy to power a micro-system [2–4]. b) Nuclear Cells, in essence based on radio isotopes, and which are sometimes associated to thermoelectric micro-generators (RTG—Radio Isotope Thermoelectric Generator) [5]. c) Magnetic induction or inductive coupling, where energy is basically transferred from a primary coil, usually external to the system, to a secondary coil, usually placed inside the system (sometimes this is complemented by an energy reservoir, such as a battery or supercapacitor) [6–9]. d) Piezoelectric micro-generators, that use the natural characteristics of some crystals or synthetic materials to produce a voltage when submitted to a pressure or compressive force [10–14]. e) Thermoelectric micro-generators (TEG), based on the Seebeck effect—a temperature gradient applied to the union of certain metals produces a voltage [15–19]. f) Electrostatic micro-generators, where electrical energy is produced by capacitance variation due to some mechanical action over the armor of an electrically charged capacitor (one of the most often used technology when implementing MEMS – Micro Electromechanical Systems – micro-generators) [20–22]. g) Electromagnetic micro-generators, which explore the interaction between electrical and magnetic fields (electromagnetic induction). The variation of a magnetic flux, produced by one or more magnets over a coil, induces an electrical current and consequently a voltage across the coil [23–26]. Today, AIMD are being used to gather data through sensors, to perform local data processing, for uni- or bi-directional communication with other peripheral equipment and, in a few cases, to perform micro-actuation. Usually each application has its own power source [27] and relies on an appropriate transducer in order to gather energy and transform it into electric energy. There are many possibilities: ambient light, either natural or artificial, or any other form of light energy, can be converted into electrical energy through photovoltaic or photoelectric devices; heat, or thermal energy, can be converted by thermoelectric generators (TEG) located where thermal gradients exist; the expansion, contraction or flow of volumes of liquids or gases and mechanical energy resulting from vibrations can be converted to electrical energy through piezoelectric or electromagnetic transducers; electromagnetic radiation, such as energy radiated by radio equipment or locally transferred by inductive coupling can be converted to electrical energy using a tuned antenna; and organic compounds present in living organisms can be used by biofuel cells to produce electrical energy. This paper describes an energy transducer that is able to power all the electronics embedded in an instrumented hip prosthesis, called a smart hip prosthesis [28]. The transducer harnesses the movement of the human body as the energy source [29–31] by using velocity-damped resonant generators (VDRG), which have been pointed out as the best approach to extract energy from human movements. An efficient power management modules uses the stored energy to power the telemetric system included in the smart hip prosthesis implant, enabling the early detection of loosening, another target application of this work. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section two we describe the implantable system and obtain its power budget, that is, a lower bound to the power that the generator must produce. Section three describes the generator itself, starting with the required theoretical background, followed by the characterization of the generator and the explanation of its working principles, both mechanical and electrical. Section four presents and evaluates an experimental energy conditioning subsystem, developed to optimize harvested energy storage. The conclusions and the work that is underway are discussed in section five, which closes the paper. 2 Implantable system overview Hip prosthesis loosening is the dominant issue affecting patients after a hip arthroplasty [32]. Early detection of loosening is of great importance, but unfortunately the traditional diagnostic techniques, based on the use of X-rays, are unable to ascertain prosthesis condition in a reliable way. This lead us to develop the instrumented and telemeterized prosthesis presented in [28]. The proposed telemetric implant comprises three fundamental subsystems: an acquisition and data processing subsystem, an activation subsystem and an energy harvesting subsystem. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the entire system, which comprises a sensor array, data conversion and processing submodules, an embedded energy source and an activation subsystem. The telemetric system is usually in a complete shutdown mode, with its energy source physically disconnected. In order to reconnect it to the energy source, an activation command must be issued through the control link antenna. After the validation of the command, the telemeterized system is powered up and the data acquisition and processing subsystems start up. At this point, the acquisition of data from the embedded sensor matrix begins. The data are converted using a 2nd-order Delta–Sigma analog-to-digital converter, processed by a low-power microcontroller and transmitted by means of a low-power RF transmitter to a base station, possibly located on the patient belt. At the end of the process the telemetric system is deactivated and returns to the shutdown mode. The activation subsystem, depicted in Fig. 2 , is responsible for the validation of commands and the activation or deactivation of the data acquisition and processing subsystem, depending on the type of command received. The activation subsystem is energized through the control link receiver antenna using an inductive link technique. Therefore, all the energy collected and stored by the energy harvesting subsystem is exclusively used by the data acquisition and processing subsystem. Fig. 2 focuses on the energy harvesting subsystem. The transducer, the main subject of this paper, converts mechanical vibrations into electrical energy. This energy is stored in a primary energy reservoir prior to be managed by the power and battery management submodule. At this stage, the acquisition and data processing subsystem is powered mainly by a Li-ion medical grade rechargeable battery [33]. In order to preserve the energy of the battery, when an activation command is issued, the power management submodule verifies if the primary energy reservoir is fully charged and if so it uses this stored energy to power the telemetric subsystem instead of using the energy of the battery. Since the telemetric system may be deactivated for long periods of time, the harvested energy may also be used to recharge the battery, in order to keep the battery ready for the next data acquisition cycle. As mentioned before, the system remains in a shutdown mode for most of the time. After the validation of an activation command, a sequence of events is performed: start-up, sensor data acquisition, conversion, processing and finally the RF transmission of the collected data to a base station. At the end of the process the system returns to the shutdown mode. Fig. 3 and Table 1 present a power budget profile of the microelectronics version of the telemetric system for a regular sequence of events. Considering a working period of 300s, there is a total energy consumption of about 360μJ with an average power of 1.21μW. In order to be a feasible power source, the generator must deliver at least this amount of energy. 3 Generator prototype After a careful bibliographic review, and taking into account the available volume inside a hip prosthesis [34], it was decided that an electromagnetic transducer mechanism would be the best choice towards harvesting the abundant vibrational energy present at the human hip location. 3.1 Theory background VDRGs are considered to be a consensual approach to harvest energy from human movements at hip localization [29,30]. Such generators, also known as inertial generators, may be represented using the basic mechanical structure represented in Fig. 4 . It consists of an inertial or seismic mass, m, coupled to a spring with elastic constant K, and a damping element, d, representing the transducer itself. Any vibration applied to the supporting structure of the generator, with an amplitude Y(t), is translated to a mass-spring movement with an amplitude of Z(t). This movement is then converted to electrical energy through an appropriate transducer. For the transducer element there are three possible mechanisms: electrostatic, where electrical energy is generated by means of capacitance variation due to mechanical action on the armor of a charged capacitor, electrically connected to the seismic mass; piezoelectric, where the deflection of the spring is used to actuate a material with piezoelectric properties that convert the deflection into electrical energy; electromagnetic, where electrical energy is generated by means of an electromotive force (emf) induced in a coil by a magnet, when they move relative to each other. Independently of the transducer mechanism, the average generated power can be determined using expression (1), where m is the inertial mass, Y 0 is the external excitation amplitude, ω is the external excitation angular frequency, ω n is the natural frequency of the system, ξ = ξ e + ξ m is the overall damping factor and ξ e and ξ m are the electrical and mechanical damping factors. (1) P = m ξ e Y 0 2 ( ω / ω n ) 3 ω 3 [ 1 − ( ω / ω n ) 2 ] 2 + [ 2 ξ ( ω / ω n ) ] 2 Expression (1) was the end result of a frequency domain analysis of this type of generators, presented in [35]. Electrical and mechanical damping factors depend on the chosen transducer mechanism and for an electromagnetic transducer mechanism they can be found using expressions described in [35]. The output voltage can be determined using expression (2), considering V = 2 P R . (2) V = B l Y 0 ω 3 ( ω n 2 − ω 2 ) 2 + ( 2 ξ ω n ω ) 2 In resonance, when ω n = ω, the output power and voltage will be maximized, and the previous expressions reduce to (3) and (4), respectively: (3) P max = m ξ e Y 0 2 ω n 3 4 ξ 2 (4) V max = B l Y 0 ω n 2 ξ If the generator is to achieve the maximum power generation and work in resonance, the choice of the components to be used and their assembly must be tuned to make the system vibrate at the same frequency as the external excitation frequency. Considering that ω n = K / m , the best way of achieving resonance is to seek a good compromise between the elastic constant of the spring, K, and the inertial mass, m, which may lead to ω n = ω. 3.2 The prototype The first experimental generator was composed by a coil and a magnet. Volume restrictions inside the prosthesis, specially considering its width, led to the lengthening of the coil in order to maximize coil turns. This lengthening is also needed so that coil turns are as close as possible to the magnetic field lines. Tests to this configuration started with a small magnet, whose length was smaller than that of the coil and led to poor results. The main reason was the weight of the inertial mass, that was clearly too small to allow resonance. However, it was suspected that the close proximity of the magnet poles could also have a negative effect on the results. Tests were made by using a coil with an accessible midpoint, so that the coil voltage signals in two different zones of the coil could be measured. For the tests, the magnet was positioned at the center of the coil then moved in the upward direction as suggested in Fig. 5 . Analysis of the response revealed that, while the north pole was producing a positive signal in the upper part of the coil (V up in Fig. 5), the south pole was producing a negative signal in the bottom part of the coil (V down in Fig. 5). The end result is that the signal of the coil, (V coil in Fig. 5), had an amplitude, positive and negative, smaller than the one measured in each part of the coil. This clearly showed that the poles of the magnet were working against each other in what concerns the coil. To reduce or even eliminate the opposing effects of the poles the distance between them had to be increased. The solution was to use a longer magnet. When this was done, the magnetic field lines became nearly perpendicular to the wiring direction of the coil, as depicted in Fig. 6 . Moving the magnet in the upward direction lead to the plots shown in Fig. 6. This movement produced an higher voltage in the upper part of the coil (V up in Fig. 6), with respect to the one measured in the bottom part of the coil (V down in Fig. 6). This clearly shows that the extreme edges of the magnet play an important role in inducing currents in the coil. In the bottom part of the coil it was possible to measure a voltage, but, since the magnetic field lines tend to be perpendicular to the wiring direction of the coil, the induced currents were considerably lower. It can also be seen that both signals are now positive and the end result is that the signal of the coil (V coil in Fig. 6), is slightly higher than V up. The larger separation between the poles of the magnet led to better results since the negative effects were eliminated. However, the higher amplitude of V up is due to the increase of the inertial mass. The use of a longer magnet also revealed a new potential location for a second generator, that is, in the new location of the south pole, as suggested in Fig. 6 by the faded coil. The wiring direction of this new coil is also important as will be explained later. In addition to this, there was still the matter of managing the various elements so that the length restrictions were not surpassed, no negative effects would arise again, and the inertial mass is suitable to reach resonance. The end result of a careful examination of all the relevant aspects and experimental results led to the construction of a prototype whose 3D representation is presented in Fig. 7 . As clearly shown, the generator is composed of two external coils wired in opposite directions and with a gap between them. Inside a Teflon tube, used to reduce friction, there is a long Neodymium magnet and a spring. At the bottom of the tube there is a magnetic brake. The spring used is an extension coil spring. In this particular case the spring is made using a beryllium/copper alloy, which is non-ferrous, in order to prevent the spring to be attracted by the magnet. The spring prevents the magnet to go beyond the top of the tube if some extraordinary force is applied to the system such as in the case of a jump, and the magnetic brake does the same considering the bottom of the tube. In the end this will also restrict the amplitude of the movement of the magnet, allowing the reduction of the length of the generator. Considering that each coil is being influenced by a different pole of the magnet, they must be wired in opposite directions so that, for each movement direction, upwards or downwards, they produce voltages with the same polarity. The net effect of the coils can be doubled by connecting them in series or in parallel. This does not cancel the produced waves, as it would if the coils had been wired in the same direction. If the two coils are connected in series their voltages will add up, and the output voltage of the generator will be maximized. If they are connected in parallel their currents will add up, and the output current of the generator, rather than its voltage, will be maximized. The wiring direction of the coils, the magnet rest position and its maximum movement amplitudes are important to maximize energy harvesting. In order to keep a balanced vertical movement, the diameter of the magnet was chosen to be slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the housing tube. Naturally this results in some friction between the magnet and the inner walls of the tube making it important to choose a low friction material for the tube such as Teflon. Fig. 8 is a 2D representation of the generator, also showing some structural details. In order to maximize inertial mass movement, the magnet is positioned so that at rest its ends are in the middle of the corresponding coil. The gap between coils is necessary so that the north pole influences only the L1 coil and the south pole influences only the L2 coil. The localization of the poles must be considered just for explanation purposes since it does not matter which pole influences which coil. The only concern is to correctly position the magnetic brake for the considered long magnet poles localization. The value of the gap length quoted was the one that led to better results, that is, to the maximization of the output voltage. The end result is a double generator in a single casing, each of which works in synchrony and adds to the output of the actual generator. This aspect is clearly presented in Fig. 9 , this last solely used for synchronism proofing. For this experiment, the coils were connected in series in order to duplicate the usable voltage. For low amplitude movements, the model presented in the previous section is adequate. However, for very high amplitude movements, the limitations imposed by the magnetic brake at the bottom of the tube and the spring at the top become important. The of course restrict the natural movement of the inertial mass, leading to nonlinear behavior. 3.3 Generator characterization Table 2 summarizes the constants that characterize each independent generator. All the characteristics are shared by the two generators, except for l, which refers to the length of the wire in just one of the coils. The complete generator weights about 15.3g occupying a total volume of 3.76cm3. Taking into consideration the study described in [36] it is expected a vertical hip movement of around 40mm and so we can consider a Y 0 =0.04m. The human gait is considered to have a frequency movement between 0.5Hz and 2Hz. Table 2 shows that the natural frequency of the generator is slightly higher than 2Hz. Considering that ω n = K / m , we can either increase the mass of the system or use a spring with a lower elastic constant. As can be seen in Fig. 10 , the prototype already occupies a large proportion of the available volume inside the hip prosthesis prototype. Considering that space is needed for the electronics and other elements of the telemetric implant, the seems to be no room left for the expansion of the generator. This means that the inertial mass size cannot be increased without making the generator bigger and heavier. Other elements with higher density could be used in between the two small magnets in order to reach resonance, but two issues arise: more mass means extra extension of the spring and the dislocation of the position of the magnet poles in respect to the center of the coils, leading to the need of a longer tube to realign the parts, which is not possible due to lack of room to extend the tube; the distribution of the magnetic field lines do not progress as in the case of the long magnet and the necessary effect, as previously explained, is not entirely achieved. Experiments with some ferromagnetic elements, such as steel, in between two magnets, led to worst results than those achieved using the long magnet. Considering an average walking frequency of 1.3Hz, for a regular walking speed, and maintaining a mass of 0.0044kg it would be necessary to use a spring with an elastic constant of about 0.29. Even though springs with such small K are very difficult to manufacture, this seems to be the best solution to reach resonance. However, even relatively far from resonance, the generator is more than capable of producing sufficient power to energize the end application. It is possible to plot the theoretical evolution of the voltage and power of the generator for different loads and different external excitation frequencies. Using expressions (1) and (2), since ω n ≠ ω, and considering the characteristics of one generator as resumed in Table 2, voltage and power delivered to a set of loads were calculated. Since both generators are connected in series, voltage results are doubled and power results are quadrupled in order to define the complete generator. Since expression (2) refers to peak voltages, the results were converted into RMS values in order to comply with practical results. These plots are depicted in Figs. 11 and 12 . After the theoretical study, it became necessary to measure the voltage of the generator under realistic conditions and to obtain power profiles. to do this a special testing configuration was set up. The generator was held at the hip location of a human subject. To control the walking speed, an electronically controlled treadmill was used. Step frequencies were cross referenced with treadmill speeds to make it possible to plot graphics consistent with the theoretical ones. As the human subject walked at controlled speed, the output voltages of the generator were obtained using a set of resistive loads connected directly to its output terminals. Since for this generator ω n ≠ ω, the output signal of the generator is expected to exhibit a maximum peak followed by a couple of damped waves. It should also be taken into account that for each step the person can land the foot with a different force. This leads to maximum peak signals of different amplitudes and consequently different amplitudes for the following damped signals too. Taking all this into consideration, the approach taken was to measure the RMS value of each individual wave of a set of signals, taken in a given time stamp, and then finding the average values. This is done for each considered load. Afterwards, considering P = V 2/R, output power was computed. The end result of these experiments is presented in Figs. 11 and 12. There is a considerable diference between the theoretical voltage evolution and the actual voltage evolution of the generator, for the same resistive load and external excitation frequency. For loads below 70kΩ practical voltages are higher than theoretical ones, independently of the frequency but, since the first ones tend to a saturation value much faster, theoretical voltage evolution eventually surpasses the practical ones. The higher the frequency the sooner this happens. One explanation for the different voltage evolutions is the fact that the human gait at hip location is more complex than considered, mainly due to foot impact. Unaccounted forces are in action promoting higher velocity movements and consequently producing higher voltages. For instance, when the foot touches the floor a powerful momentum is created accelerating the magnet movement along the length of the coils inducing higher voltage peaks than the ones expected if this would not happen. As stated before, the presented generator may not entirely follow the simplified model presented in a previous section, since this model is to be applied to linear inertial generators and the proposed generator may not behave linearly for certain applied forces. First of all, the generator is composed by two equally built transducers and this may present some variables not accounted for in the basic model. Secondly, if a large acceleration is applied to the generator, the inertial mass will suffer a strong repulsion force due to the magnetic brake, leading to a nonlinear movement of the mass-spring system. Thirdly, due to generator length restriction, both spring and magnetic brake are used to restrict inertial mass amplitude movement and this may also lead to a nonlinear movement. Also to be considered is the fact that the external excitation of the generator is not purely sinusoidal due to the complexities of the human gait. Considering all these aspects and the differences between practical and theoretical results, a a more accurate model, able to caracterize more complex generators, should be used. However, nonlinear systems are in general difficult to model and the the presented generator does not seem to be an exception. Some research is being conducted in order to use nonlinear techniques to promote a performance enhancement of initially linear systems [37]. Moreover, it has been found that nonlinear systems, or nonlinear behavior of the system, due to nonlinearities of some elements of the system in specific situations, can actually lead to improved performance of those systems [38,39]. In addition, linear systems are usually developed to work in a specific frequency or in a very narrow band of frequencies. It has been pointed out that nonlinearities may also improve the bandwidth of the system, allowing it to work for a wider range of frequencies [40]. In this context, nonlinear behavior is accounted for the superior performance of the presented generator, when compared to the theoretical simulation. As expected, the voltage increases with increasingly resistive load, but it tends to a limit. While the voltage increases with load the current decreases and this aspect leads to the practical power evolution depicted in Fig. 12, where it is visible a power peak production. This peak depends mostly on coils DC resistance and their internal parasitic resistance, the latter depending on the frequency of the movement. 4 Energy conditioning subsystem Although the transducer that has been described is able to produce power, the generator may not be able to handle a load directly. This raises the following questions: how can the power produced be effectively used? Can power demanding loads be efficiently accomodated? The simplest solution to these problems is to store the energy: the energy is first accumulated in a storage element and only then used to feed the load. 4.1 Energy storage One of the main drawbacks of the type of generators used is that they may provide only a very small current, no more than a few tens of micro amperes. Supercapacitors have higher power densities than regular capacitors and would appear at first sight to lead to better solutions, but their use would lead to very long charging times. In fact, the charging time will be considerable even when using regular capacitors. After taking these considerations into account, we decided to include in the energy storage submodule a series rectification circuit, such as the one depicted in Fig. 13 . The rectifying circuit is connected in series with the generator, so that the the maximum possible current is used to charge the capacitors, accelerating the process relatively to the parallel rectifying circuit. With this configuration, each capacitor is charged with the corresponding polarity signal and the DC output voltage will be close to twice the value that would be obtained with a regular parallel rectification configuration. Considering the practical results depicted in Fig. 11, for loads above 30kΩ we can count on at least 2.55 V rms at the output of the generator. The use of a DC–DC converter with a 3.3V output voltage requires, for best results, a voltage across the input capacitors between V L =1.4V and V H =3.1V. Since each capacitor will be charged with half this value, using (5) with capacitors of 1000μF we get 956.25μJ per capacitor, leaving us with a total 1912.5μJ of usable energy. (5) E = C 2 ( V H 2 − V L 2 ) Moreover, before enabling the DC–DC converter it is crucial to check the voltage across the capacitors, which must fall within the range V L to V H. 4.2 Power supply subsystem In order to optimally use the energy stored in the capacitors and be able to charge them to useful voltages, we need a control circuit that only enables the DC–DC converter when the capacitors are charged at V H, for instance. On the other hand there is no point to let the capacitors discharge below a specified voltage. The control circuit will therefore disable the DC–DC converter when the combined voltage of the capacitors falls below V L. This will speed up the charging of the capacitors preparing them for the next telemetric system working cycle. Naturally, there will be two different phases: the charging phase, in in which the capacitors are being charged, and the working phase, when the DC–DC converter is feeding the telemetric system. The control circuit was implemented using a low-power, accurate battery monitor such as the MAX6777 (MAXIM Integrated Products, USA). This integrated circuit was chosen to accurately control the range of monitored capacitor voltage, since the hysteresis is defined by an external high-value resistance. For the DC–DC converter, a high-efficiency, low-supply current, step-up converter such as the MAX1674 (MAXIM Integrated Products, USA) was chosen. The end result is depicted in Fig. 13. Once again the generator was held at hip height of a human subject and the person walked with controlled velocity at the rate of 1.3Hz. This rate was chosen solely because it represents a regular, average walking speed. Naturally, for lower frequencies we will get a slightly lower power production and for higher frequencies we will get a slightly higher power production. A 100kΩ load was connected to the power supply submodule output and relevant signals were measured, Fig. 14 . As can be seen, the voltage of the capacitors rises until they reach 3.1V. At this point, the MAX6777 low battery output signal (LBO) de-asserts, enabling the DC–DC converter. For a few seconds, 3.3V are delivered to the load with the consequent discharge of the capacitors, during which a complete data acquisition cycle takes place. When the voltage across the capacitors goes below 1.4V, MAX6777 LBO output asserts, disabling the DC–DC converter. If the subject continues walking the process will start all over again. For a 100kΩ load and a subject moving at a rate of 1.3Hz, it is possible to obtain working phases with approximate durations of 9.2s. Except for the initial charging phase, the subsequent ones will take approximately 34.8s to complete. Considering that the load draws a current of 33μA and that the working cycle lasts 9.2s, the result is a total power of 108.9μW or 1001.88μJ. Considering the aforementioned total usable energy and the amount of energy delivered to the load, we see that the it is feasible to energize the telemetric system with the proposed electromagnetic generator, in a sustainable way. 5 Conclusions and final remarks Biomedical implants are undoubtedly a rising trend. For decades they were powered mainly by batteries or through electromagnetic induction. While these powering systems are well established they may not be considered as optimal solutions. Energy harvesting from the environment of the application has been suggested as one way of improving them. On one hand it would allow the development of completely autonomous applications and on the other, it would extend the lifetime of the application, by drawing from an energy source this is theoretically unlimited. When the environment of the application is the human body, the energy obtained from its movement or vibrations is considered the most abundant. It is clearly possible to harvest energy from other sources, such as from body heat, but the current transducer technology is able to draw greater power densities from vibrations than it draws from heat. A well designed transducer may generate enough electrical energy to supply the needs of low-power electronic systems such as those found in most biomedical implants. We have explored this idea and designed an electromagnetic generator that is able to harvest energy from mechanical vibrations. Careful design optimizations carried out during the development of the generator led to the construction of a double generator without increasing the initial volume. Both generators are similar and work synchronously, that is, they produce voltages with the same amplitude, polarity and phase. The approach is very flexible: to maximize the voltage obtained, the generators can be connected in series; to maximize the current, they can be connected in parallel. We demonstrated that by harvesting energy from the mechanical vibrations at hip location produced by human gait it was possible to supply the power needs of a telemetric implantable device, in a sustainable way. Although the system described already represents a substantial improvement over traditional systems based on batteries or electromagnetic induction, there is still room for improvement, related for example to further optimization of the power management subsystem, which is being implemented in standard 0.35μm CMOS technology. Concerning the generator itself, the use of a better adapted spring could bring the system closer to resonance, and increase the power produced even further.

Keywords Precision agriculture Wireless sensor networks Gateway Data aggregation and integration Site-specific management Service-oriented computing 1 Introduction Precision agriculture (PA) and precision viticulture (PV) involve using electronic, communication and information technologies to collect large amounts of data in the field to use in site-specific crop management (Stafford, 2000). Wireless sensors are considered the best technology to gather the massive amounts of data needed, for example, to understand production variability (Camilli et al., 2007) or estimate growth profiles (Moreenthaler et al., 2003). Arranged to form widespread ad hoc networks, known as wireless sensor networks (WSN), they have been used to assist in spatial data collection, precision irrigation, variable-rate technology and in supplying data to farmers (Lamb and Bramley, 2001; Wang et al., 2006). However, these technologies are still far from being firmly established in agricultural practice and farming enterprises (Kitchen, 2007). The volume and nature of the data introduce a significant challenge in the development of WSN in PA. Massive amounts of raw data do not necessarily yield proportional amounts of information. There are obvious difficulties in interpreting the data involved in order to reach a better understanding of the causes of variability and in proposing sound strategies for field variability management (Murakami et al., 2007; Rundel et al., 2009; Bramley, 2009). The nature of the data also brings difficulties: the data are heterogeneous and the management of heterogeneous data sources poses specific problems (Plant, 2001). The task of getting meaningful information from many disparate sensors is not trivial (Ibrahim et al., 2005). Energy and networking issues need also to be considered. Typically, a large and remote agricultural area has to be covered with small data acquisition devices, which must harvest energy to run (Morais et al., 2008b). Each device faces severe power constraints, and the coverage of large areas may only be possible if several levels of internetworking are combined to achieve a higher level of network performance and scalability. To better manage the data and address the networking and scalability issues we propose to carry data aggregation and data integration in the field, close to the WSN. This implies the creation of an intermediate layer of aggregation nodes that manage the sensor networks and perform local data integration and supervision functions. The goal of this paper is to describe an intelligent gateway (iPAGAT) that implements this intermediate layer and the underlying data processing functions. The gateway provides capabilities that we consider critical to the success of PV and PA in general: hierarchical networking, remote management, in situ interactions, Internet access and site-specific management tools. It also helps to convert the raw bits into useful information for the farmer and to distribute the processing load. The intermediate layer fits very well to the demands of power-constrained wireless sensors and provides a link between the sensors and the central office or decision center: a link that we regard as critical but that has largely been missing. This paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the motivation in more detail and puts the paper in perspective with respect to the state-of-the-art, focusing on the hierarchical management of agricultural zones, the use of WSN in distributed monitoring of the environment and in-field data processing topics. The material and methods section describes the iPAGAT gateway in detail: its hardware and features, the communication capabilities and the software architecture. The experiments and results section gives a detailed account of the experiments performed to evaluate the gateway as well as some results achieved with the current implementation. The paper closes with the conclusion and discussion section, which summarises our findings and highlights the main contributions of this research. 2 Motivation and background 2.1 WSN in distributed monitoring of the environment The advantages of using WSN technologies to assist PA/PV practices (Wang et al., 2006) are far reaching and motivating. Unfortunately, the effective and general deployment of wireless sensing devices remains constrained by energy requirements and networking issues (Thomas et al., 2006; Raghunathan et al., 2006). Because of this, practical implementations often use some sort of sink node or base station (usually free of energy restrictions) to collect and relay data from field WSNs to upper data processing layers, typically relegated to a remote location. Smart irrigation systems are a good example of this. They are among the most frequently used WSN applications. The sensors are used to assess the hydrological status of the soil and control the site-specific irrigation process. For instance, Vellidis et al. (2008) present a low-cost sensor array that is used to assess soil moisture contents in a cotton crop and transmit sensor data wirelessly to a centralised receiver, which works as the sink node. Kim et al. (2008) describe an irrigation system that uses wireless devices to acquire soil humidity data samples and send them to an in-field base station, which performs the decision-making required for an efficient use of the irrigation water. The use of WSN technology to study the variability in vineyards is reported by Beckwith et al. (2004). They describe a 65-node, 8-hop depth network deployed across a 2-acre vineyard that is used to acquire and transmit temperature data to a base station within the managed zone, for the purpose of studying frost pocket, cold patterns and heat unit accumulation differences and their effect on Vitis vinifera grapes. The NAV system (Matese et al., 2009) consists of a base agrometeorological station (Master Unit, placed in a representative site) and a series of peripheral wireless nodes (Slave Units), up to a maximum of 20, located in the vineyard. It adopts a proprietary wireless technology that uses the ISM 433MHz band and a proprietary half-duplex data transfer protocol for communication with the Slave Units. In this implementation, the Master Unit stores all of the Slave Units data and is able to forward them to a remote central server, using a GSM/GPRS device. Mainwaring et al. (2002), Suri et al. (2006) and Rundel et al. (2009) examine the requirements of environmental WSN used to monitor wildlife habitats. In addition to hardware design and energy issues, their research also focuses on the remaining general key issues that should be considered for the effective deployment of scalable WSNs: hierarchical networking, remote management, in situ interactions and Internet access, among other aspects. The concept of Field Server is explored by Fukatsu and Hirafuji (2005), who introduced a sensor-node equipped with a web server and a wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11b/g) to create a remote field monitoring system. Each Field Server is a standalone device that provides Internet access with hotspot capabilities. This solution can provide ubiquitous networking in PA/PV environments but the devices need to be permanently connected to their neighbourhoods, adding to the energy needs. 2.2 Hierarchical management of agricultural zones Proprietary solutions regarding data communications protocols can always be effectively employed but are often the rule in the case of emerging and/or experimental technologies. Industry standards have important and well-known advantages and are usually associated with more mature stages of development. Wireless personal area networks (WPAN) are no exceptions to this. The lack of standardisation in WPAN lead the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) to design the IEEE 802.15.4 WPAN family of standards, intended for low-power, low bandwidth sensor applications (IEEE, 2006; Baronti et al., 2007). IEEE 802.15.4 enables the creation of complex ad hoc networks, allowing ultra-low power devices, with very short wake-up times at very low cost. This standard assumes that the payload transmitted is short and that transmissions occur at a low duty-cycle. These characteristics are adequate for applications that require a very long battery life or even the combination of energy harvesting techniques with rechargeable batteries (Rundel et al., 2009; Morais et al., 2008a,b). Within an IEEE 802.15.4 WPAN, the network is created and managed by a unique network coordinator, which acts as a sink node to all network nodes. This makes the standard suitable for clustered and mesh WSN architectures. From the management zone perspective, López et al. (2009) present a field implementation of a horticultural crop monitoring network that uses gateways to relay data from in-field WSN back to a base station located at the farm offices. Temperature, relative humidity, electrical conductivity, soil moisture and salinity are among the parameters that are measured by sensing nodes that exchange data using IEEE 802.15.4 low-power links. From the energy and networking requirements viewpoint, the coverage of large and remote agricultural areas with small data acquisition devices that need to harvest energy to run (Morais et al., 2008b) requires the combination of several levels of internetworking for optimum networking performance and scalability. To achieve this, data aggregation and data integration should be accomplished in the field, close to the sensor network. The resulting intermediate layer of aggregation nodes would manage the sensor network, performing local data integration and supervision. Multiple management zones could be easily identified and managed. The advantages of an intermediate layer between the data acquisition layer and the upper level processing and decision support systems, which many authors regard as middleware (Yu et al., 2003; Heinzelman et al., 2004; Curino et al., 2005; Hadim and Mohamed, 2006), become clear. However, the need to render, process and interpret the data that arises from intensive field data acquisition (Kitchen, 2007) makes efficient system integration a critical goal. 2.3 In-field data processing and services The heterogeneity of the sensor nodes or data acquisition devices poses a challenge that needs to be addressed in order to give a satisfactory solution to the PV problem. The heterogeneity makes the extraction and aggregation problems more difficult and broadens the gap between the acquisition of the data and their availability at the processing layer. On the other hand, some authors (Govindan et al., 2002; Hu and Kumar, 2006; Choochaisri and Intanagonwiwat, 2008) have considered sensor networks as a distributed database, which suggests the creation of query mechanisms for accessing summarised information related to the managed area, as well as lists of sensors and sensor attributes (Johannes et al., 2001). The deployment of in-field gateways and the associated intermediate layer would help to meet the networking and scalability demands, allow data aggregation and integration where it makes more sense – in the field, in the vicinity of the sensor network – and would ease the implementation of in-field data processing and services. In-field gateways may act as service providers to local users through the use of common wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth (Garg, 2007) or IEEE 802.11 (Fukatsu and Hirafuji, 2005). Site-specific management tools can then access all gateway data by using a smartphone after an authentication process. Examples of such applications are described by Cunha et al. (2010), who use visual tags to automatically associate a field location to its relevant database tables or records, and to access contextual information or services, useful in PV practices. Fang and He (2008) also emphasise the importance of in-field data processing and management infrastructures. They describe a field information collection, control and management system targeted at PA practices and which is expected to serve as a foundation for the development of field data collection equipment. Our goal when designing the iPAGAT was to meet the multiple requirements discussed throughout this section. The gateway, described in the next section, allows hierarchical networking and remote management, but it also provides Internet access and supports in situ interactions and site-specific management tools. 3 Materials and methods In this section we describe the implementation of iPAGAT, an intelligent and autonomous gateway for in-field processing that we regard as a crucial element of our PV system. We describe first its relation with the rest of our PV system, then its overall architecture, and finally the hardware and software implementation details. 3.1 Background and overview of the system The iPAGAT gateway is part of a long-term effort to establish PV in the hillside vineyards of the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) in Northeast Portugal. The soil of the region is mainly based on complex schist, which makes the assessment of the hydrological status difficult. The vineyards have unique characteristics. The topographic aspects, erosion control, vertical planting, limited water availability, and wide temperature span across all day and year dictate the use of distributed field monitoring and information processing for both operation and performance assessment, in the context of zonal vineyard management. Fig. 1 illustrates the scenario and identifies all the relevant management levels. The bottom layer (L1) embraces all data gathering procedures and relies on WSN technology to collect environmental data within vineyards grouped as a management zone. Layer 2 (L2) devices coordinate the WSN and perform local processing tasks, such as data aggregation. They can also act as an in-field local access point (AP) to site-specific management applications. L2 entities, as gateways to the managed zones, are connected to a Layer 3 (L3) entity which is responsible for farm management in a whole-farm basis concept. Higher layers (L4 and L5) are related to farmer associations and country policies and will not be discussed in this article. In this scenario, three levels of communication networking can coexist: WSN links between gateways and sensor nodes (L2↔L1 connections), Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.11 links between gateways and local user mobile devices (L2↔smartphone connections), and long-range GSM/GPRS and/or IEEE 802.11 links between gateways and the farm management level (L2↔L3 connections). The small stationary data acquisition devices denoted by MPWiNodeZ (Morais et al., 2008a) are an important component of the scenario illustrated in Fig. 1. They are deployed across a specified management zone following a mesh network topology, according to the ZigBee standard. This network has its coordinator operating at the gateway infrastructure of the managed area. Besides WSN management, the network coordinator also operates as a sink node for the gathered data, filling up the gateway database, where data aggregation is performed. The gateway (L2 layer) is also responsible for making data available locally and/or to upper layers, through the use of web-services. Having provided the necessary background information, we may now describe the gateway architecture in detail. 3.2 Gateway architecture The gateway architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2 (system) and Fig. 3 (software). This section gives only a high-level, block-oriented overview of the system. Details about each block will be given in the following sections. The iPAGAT gateway is powered by means of a solar panel combined with a rechargeable battery, under the control of a voltage supervision system. The inter-network connection capabilities of iPAGAT gateway are shown in Fig. 2: Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies are needed to allow authenticated smartphones to access information in the field. In addition to this range of connectivity solutions, the iPAGAT also supports real-time video streaming captured by a 2-axis positioned web camera, useful for image-based applications, such as remote surveillance. As shown in Fig. 3, the software architecture of iPAGAT is built around a relational database management system (RDBM), which provides the main repository for the data gathered from the WSN as well as for the WSN operating rules, and three Java applications: the WSN manager, the Aggregation Engine and a Real-Time Alert System, RTAS. The WSN manager links the WSN, which produces the data, to the RDBM, where the data are stored or aggregated. It performs a number of auxiliary tasks, including network creation, management, and device configuration. Its main task, however, is to collect the data produced by the WSN acquisition devices and signal to the RTAS whenever new data have become available. WSN are notorious producers of massive amounts of heterogeneous information. The data aggregation engine takes the data produced by the WSN and summarises them by aggregation. It periodically goes over the data and updates their mean, maximum and minimum values, storing the updated results back in the data base. The RTAS reacts to both real-time sensor readings stored in the data base and the data produced by the aggregation engine. Its purpose is to check if the sensor readings are within certain (programmable) limits. If the limits are exceeded, the RTAS sends an alert to a remote user using a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) request. As discussed elsewhere, this can be used to detect combinations of climacteric factors that favour the occurrence of diseases or plagues, and trigger alarms if and when they are detected. 3.3 Hardware description The iPAGAT infrastructure is preferably a fixed structure comprising a single-board computer (SBC), a IEEE 802.15.4 WSN coordinator, a long range IP-based GSM/GPRS modem and a IEEE 802.11 AP (Access Point), all powered by a rechargeable battery, which is charged using a solar-panel. As we have seen in Fig. 2 iPAGAT supports Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies, as well as real-time video streaming captured by a 2-axis positioned web camera, useful for applications such as remote surveillance. It also has to meet the computational processing needs required by local aggregation and data integration tasks. To comply with these demands, the iPAGAT was built around the SBC Zeus (Eurotech Ltd., UK). This device, illustrated in Fig. 4 , is an ultra low power EPIC (Embedded Platform for Industrial Computing, 165mm×115mm) single board computer based on Marvell’s 520MHz PXA270 XScale® processor. The PXA270 is an implementation of the ARM compliant Intel XScale microarchitecture combined with a comprehensive set of integrated peripherals including an USB host/client controller, interrupt controller and multiple serial ports. The Zeus includes a site for a variety of wireless modems and is designed to create cost effective solutions in asset monitoring and network solutions. To this effect, Eurotech Ltd. has released a GSM/GPRS, iDEN, CDMA modem, and GPS, using a low profile add-on module. Other features include an onboard DC/DC power supply unit, two Ethernet ports, two USB host ports and seven serial ports, which are used to connect several external devices. Besides its 256MB of SDRAM and 64MB of flash memory, a 8-GB USB memory pen is used as an external disk for the operating system and filesystem. The Zeus runs a Debian Linux Operating System (OS), with power-saving applications in order to enable/disable peripherals, to support all the software needed to the embedded data aggregation and integration systems. To this effect, Zeus becomes a fully functional server with SSH, FTP, web server (Apache 2), MySQL Server, PHP, IPTables, Java and Tomcat support. The energy to power Zeus is harvested from the sun by means of a 40W solar panel (KC40, Kyocera, Japan) combined with a 25Ah rechargeable dryfit battery (A512/25G5, Sonnenschein, Germany) and a voltage regulator (Solsum 6.6C, Steca, Germany). To prevent undervoltage damage, we designed a voltage supervisor sub-system that deactivates the Zeus device when the battery voltage falls below a predefined voltage level, the current trip point being 11.5V. When an undervoltage condition is detected, the voltage supervision sub-system issues a command through an available RS232 port, halting the system and causing a soft shutdown. When the battery charge reaches a safe level (terminal voltage of about 13.0V), the supervision sub-system reconnects Zeus power, which makes it boot normally. 3.4 Connectivity support One of the major goals of the iPAGAT infrastructure was to provide an intermediate, in-field level of inter-networking through any available wireless standard. To this effect, three categories of wireless communications are provided. First, a standard wireless protocol to support L1 layer data gathering functions, as the ones provided by any compliant WSN. Second, a layer provided by a local wireless network, created through the use of standard wireless protocol, that may be used to establish a connection with a smartphone. Finally, a third layer that uses a long-range IP-based protocol to provide Internet and Intranet connections to iPAGAT. In order to support a WSN that builds upon IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee standard, such as those presented in Morais et al., 2008a, an IEEE 802.15.4 network coordinator is required. The physical implementation of the IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee WSN coordinator was accomplished by using an USB Dongle (IA OEM-DAUB1 2400, Integration, UK). This IEEE 802.15.4 interface can be quickly and easily connected to the Zeus through the USB 1.1 interface and provides a simple method of integrating IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee into L2 gateways. The dongle is available with a choice of two driver options: the IEEE 802.15.4 drivers provide direct access to the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC interface and the ZigBee drivers allow the dongle to operate within a ZigBee network and expose the AF/ZDO Application Interfaces. With such functionality, the development of an effective WSN manager becomes straightforward. Smartphones of authenticated users can access the iPAGAT system through a WPAN created with Bluetooth technology or/and by means of a WLAN using IEEE 802.11 technology. To this effect, the iPAGAT is equipped with a Bluetooth dongle (CBT200U2A, Conceptronic, The Netherlands). This provides a simple interface to access field information, to configure iPAGAT settings and to perform other data management operations. iPAGAT also makes available a WLAN using an IEEE 802.11 AP (Open-Mesh, Wireless Mesh Router, OMIP Model), connected to Zeus through an Ethernet cable. To accomplish the goal of providing communications support between iPAGAT and the higher management level (farm management level, L3 in Fig. 1), each iPAGAT is equipped with an add-on GSM/GPRS wireless modem board and an AP, with mesh network support, enabling an ubiquitous networking environment. With this AP, each iPAGAT can operate in bridge/repeater, access point and client modes, and act as a data relay point. 3.5 Software architecture The block-level view of the software architecture of iPAGAT has already been briefly described, based on Fig. 3. The figure shows that iPAGAT has several communication interfaces, accessible through a web-based interface. These are needed to exchange data with local handheld devices and remote L3 farm management applications, which includes a global data warehouse. The iPAGAT gateway uses an external WSN manager to coordinate a IEEE 802.15.4 compliant network, composed by multichannel acquisition devices that are deployed across a management zone. We will now discuss the main software blocks of iPAGAT in some more detail. These are the RDBM and three Java applications: the WSN manager, the Aggregation Engine and a Real-Time Alert System, RTAS. 3.5.1 The relational database management system The RDBM is the main data repository of iPAGAT and is built around a MySQL RDBM. Fig. 5 depicts the relational diagram of the RDBM, composed by 10 tables. The main table is called zeusdb.nodes and it has an entry for each acquisition device in the network. The primary key of this table provides the most convenient way of referring to any specific network device. Each device is also classified according to a user-specific management zone. This is accomplished by using the table zeusdb.zone, in which the field Coordinates stores a relevant location within the zone. Since each acquisition device may have more than one sensor, the database has the additional table zeusdb.nodesensors which stores the information about each sensor. Rules of operation are described through table zeusdb.rules, which contains trip point values that are used by the RTAS. Microclimacteric data, acquired by any compliant IEEE 802.15.4 network device, is gathered by the WSN manager and stored in the table zeusdb.sensordata for a 7-day period in a FIFO basis. The fields Node and Channel identify and classify each data source by utilisation purpose and by management zone. Summarised information (aggregation data) regarding all sensor data is produced by the Java aggregation engine, which runs periodically and fills up the table zeusdb.aggdata. The content can then be uploaded to a global data warehouse, through queries over the data integration interface. A third Java application, the core of the alert system, inspects the tables, compares their data with threshold values, and depending on the circumstances produces an alarm or a generic event. These applications are described hereafter. 3.5.2 WSN manager and WSN engine The WSN manager is a Java application running on iPAGAT that basically controls an external IEEE 802.15.4 network coordinator (WSN engine) through a UART physical connection. Besides network creation and management operations, the WSN manager is responsible for data operations over the deployed WSN, such as device configuration and sensor data exchange. When new data reaches the WSN engine, as a result of an individual measurement taken on an acquisition device, it is converted to engineering units using the parametrisation defined in zeusdb.units and zeusdb.sensortype tables and the result is stored as a new entry in the zeusdb.sensordata table. Each entry in this table is composed of the source identification, network node identification, acquisition channel related to each node, measurement data and associated time stamp, enabling full characterisation of each data sample. After data insertion in zeusdb.sensordata, the RTAS is signalled (through an internal data socket) with the new data available. 3.5.3 The data aggregation engine As mentioned before, each WSN acquisition device can be regarded as an independent data source that generates records with several fields. When considering a routing protocol to communicate with nodes that are spatially distant, such as the standard IEEE 802.15.4 (IEEE, 2006), or in the case of nodes with limited computation, energy and storage capabilities, several issues arise, such as network traffic overload. WSN may generate a huge amount of data coming from a multitude of heterogeneous data sources. The traffic is usually centralised or forwarded to the sink node. These large data sets cannot be transmitted regularly and efficiently to higher-level processing stages without being aggregated. Aggregation may also be useful to increase the range of knowledge, level of accuracy and to create data redundancy to compensate for software or hardware failures in WSN nodes (Ibrahim et al., 2005; Akkaya et al., 2008; Tubaishat et al., 2003). Under this point of view, every sensor reading that reaches the WSN manager is aggregated to compute a summarised result available through the web-based integration system. According to Akkaya et al. (2008), data aggregation is the process of combining multiple data packets into one by looking at their contents. In iPAGAT, the data aggregation engine is a Java application that makes periodic data iterations, with period determined by the field zeusdb.AggDataCycleTime of the zeusdb.config table. The first task executed by this application is to build the query for getting the data of the whole day for each channel of an acquisition device. It then executes the query and saves the result. Next, it calculates the mean, the maximum and the minimum values and executes an UPDATE statement with the calculated values and the last set of values. If there is no entry to update, it executes an INSERT statement. At the end of each aggregation cycle, the aggregation engine signals the RTAS with new data (from zeusdb.aggdata tables). 3.5.4 Real-time alert system The RTAS is a Java application that, as seen in Fig. 3, runs on top of the RDBM system and reacts to the real-time sensor readings and the summarised information that results from the data aggregation process. It illustrates the benefits of local processing and decision. It has a socket-based interface with both the WSN manager and aggregation engine and a SOAP web services based approach. SOAP provides a uniform and reliable mechanism for data exchange over TCP/IP links, and eases the interaction with mobile devices (such as smartphones or cellphones) and the connection with remote management applications. The purpose of the RTAS engine is to check the data from both the WSN manager and the aggregation engine to verify if sensor readings stored in the tables zeusdb.aggdata and zeusdb.sensordata are within the limits defined by the fields min_value and max_value of the table zeusdb.rules. If the limits are exceeded, the RTAS sends an automatic alert to a remote user using a SOAP request. Functional flowchart is depicted in Fig. 6 . The alerting system can also be used to signal the existence of conditions favourable to the occurrence of diseases or plagues based on the combination of certain climacteric factors. For example, if the soil moisture in a certain region reaches values below a minimum defined value, an automatic alert is issued in order to turn-on an irrigation valve. 1 illustrates the conceptual definition of a RTAS rule while 2 gives an example. 3.5.5 The data integration interface All the mentioned software components have been built with the goal of collecting and aggregating data from heterogeneous data sources such as those provided by WSN. The data integration system is at the interface with the iPAGAT and it basically bridges two different realities: one responsible for collecting and making data available, and another that makes intensive use of such data without the need to know how it is generated, processed and returned. The data integration system was designed with the goal of providing a high-level access to sensor data stored in a in-field WSN gateway. The implementation of iPAGAT data integration system interface follows a WS approach, and provides the necessary query mechanism for retrieving gateway data. To improve query processing efficiency, there are basically two types of queries corresponding to the two types of data and tables: raw data and aggregated data. The first query type is related to the raw data that is available in each gateway RDBM system and follows the on-demand approach (i.e., extracting data from the zeusdb.sensordata table only when the query is posed). This query enables the retrieval of individual sensor data. It is buffered in a 7-days time period window before being discarded. The command center or any authenticated user can use this mechanism whenever needed. The second type of query is related to the gateway summarised information, stored in the iPAGAT zeusdb.aggdata table. The result of each aggregated engine cycle is stored in the appropriate table for a 7-day time period window. Raw data and aggregated data tables are continuously updated by the RDBM system by inserting new data and discarding old one. While raw data is permanently discarded, summarised information can be transferred to a data warehouse by issuing an appropriate query. Summarised data older than this 7-day period must be requested directly to the data warehouse. By using this approach, global query processing is optimised, gateway query processing is made more efficient and data exchange between iPAGAT and the data warehouse can be relegated to periods of low network activity. The web-based data integration interface defines a set of WS containing all operations that are needed to handle gateway data. As an example, the operation getSensorData_by is shown in 3 . As observed, the user provides high-level parameters as Zone, Utilisation, SensorType, etc., in order to get/retrieve data, instead of using low-level ones such as NodeID, Channel, etc. 4 Experiments and results An experiment was conducted on vineyards at the UTAD Agricultural Research Centre, Vila Real, Portugal, starting in the Spring of 2008, with three main objectives: (1) the study of hi-power ZigBee wireless devices and their impact on the well established MPWiNodeZ data acquisition platform (Morais et al., 2008b); (2) the evaluation of iPAGAT hardware and power management techniques, based on a solar panel/dry fit battery set-up; (3) the evaluation of the built-in data aggregation engine and the data integration interface, as key blocks of the gateway software architecture. For this purpose, the iPAGAT hardware structure was mounted in the roof of our Engineering Laboratory building in order to establish wireless links to MPWiNodeZ devices deployed according to the map in Fig. 7 . Two of them (referred to as Malv01 and Malv02 in Fig. 7) have been used since the start of this experiment in real-time monitoring. They collect micrometeorological parameters in a vineyard (air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation), to assist in mildew powdery disease modelling. Device P3 is used to route Malv01 and Malv02 data back to the iPAGAT. The other four devices (P4, P5, P6 and P7) were installed in more remote locations, in order to evaluate ZigBee Jennic hi-power (+20dBm) modules (JN5148-001-M04, Jennic, UK) as routing elements of a generic ad hoc network based on the MPWiNodeZ platform. In this case, the battery voltage discharging profiles and the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) were recorded by each MPWinodeZ device and routed back to the network coordinator – a part of the iPAGAT system – for storage and post-processing. Network layout, node distances and LQI values are presented in Fig. 7. 4.1 iPAGAT DC current consumption The iPAGAT is powered by a 40W solar panel and a 25Ah capacity battery. With all devices but the Bluetooth dongle turned on, iPAGAT consumes an electrical DC current of approximately 300mA over 12.6V, which gives an overall power consumption of 3.78W. Fig. 8 shows the battery charging/discharging profile as well as the DC current consumption for a 10-day period. iPAGAT housing internal temperature (onboard temperature sensor) is also shown. The Bluetooth discovery service is turned as well as the GPRS modem and the IEEE 802.11 interface. 4.2 iPAGAT data gadget iPAGAT data can be accessed through its data integration system interface by posing specific queries. Fig. 9 shows a Windows gadget feature used to demonstrate how easily data can be remotely retrieved and visualised directly on a Windows desktop. In the example, the aggregated data summarise relative humidity, air temperature and solar radiation acquired by the Malv02 node. 4.3 RTAS in disease prediction To illustrate the advantages of the RTAS embedded in the iPAGAT we developed a simple disease probability monitoring system, depicted in Fig. 10 . At the end of each aggregation cycle, each uploaded rule is checked against the aggregated data. The example is based on a mildew disease prediction model Cruz (1982). If the precipitation has been above 10mm, the zone temperature has been within 10°C and 11°C, the relative humidity has remained above 80%, and the rule has been consistently triggered throughout a certain number of days, a warning is generated. 5 Conclusions and discussion The deployment of a wireless sensor network and its use in the PV context is not straightforward. The acquisition of the raw data is left to a number of typically small, low-power, energy-harvesting devices but decision support systems depend on higher-level data representations. There is a gap between what the low-level devices provide and what the higher levels need. This difficulty can be overcome at a cost (computing power and bandwidth) but as the number of sensors increases, the volume of the raw data and the resources needed become prohibitive. The iPAGAT gateway was designed to bridge the gap between the sensors and the decision-making. It circumvents the difficulties created by a centralised processing model by providing an intermediate layer between the sensor network and a remote location. The iPAGAT is deployed in the field and as such it must be autonomous. Our field tests confirm that its power needs can in general be met by harvesting solar energy. The iPAGAT is therefore capable of continuous operation and is fully compatible with the sensor devices used. The testing also showed that several consecutive cloudy days may cause a power failure. We verified that the replacement of the original 25Ah dry-fit battery with one of higher capacity (A512/55A, Sonnenschein, Germany) considerably reduces the probability of a failure. The iPAGAT increases the overall intelligence of the sensor network. It runs an aggregation engine and performs intermediate level data processing. By doing so, it distributes the work load. The test results shows that the software architecture and database structure are adequate and that the system performs well even under intensive use. The communication capabilities of the iPAGAT, which include Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and GPRS, have also proven very useful. They allow local and remote users to access the Internet, but, more importantly, they make it possible for users located in the field to access gateway and remote data, using authenticated smartphones. This flexibility opens up the way for further developments and applications, some of which we have already begin to discuss (Cunha et al., 2010). Our field experiments and tests provide convincing evidence that iPAGAT represents an important step forward in the development of distributed service-oriented information systems for precision agriculture applications.

However, the researches about educational learning models often ignore the parents' part. Internet opens a new paradigm: education and communication approach is more complex than ever. Here, we would like to present an Internet based system to support students' homework. We believe that one of the major advantages of our system is time saving, particularly from the teacher's point of view. Also, this system gathers statistical data concerning different groups of students selected by the teacher. From these data on, the teacher can easily see where the students are having problems and decide what to do next. From the student (or parent) point of view, the prompt feedback about the exercises correctness, added to the training with different exercises sets about the same subject, besides the utilization of video, color, sound, etc., that positively reinforce child's senses, are elected as the main advantages. © 2011 IEEE.",

Afterwards, this energy becomes available to the telemetric system through an efficient power management module. Since the end application, an implantable biomedical telemetric system, needs a total of 360 μJ to operate, the here presented power transducer is well suited for implant power needs.",

As it was expected, the induction motor is sensitive to voltage fluctuations within certain amplitude levels and frequencies.

The probe was tested in agar to demonstrate the potential advantages of the button heat pulse sensor for soil water content measurements. It was possible to have an 0.5 °C temperature rise with only 156mW of power consumption, a ten times power reduction in heat-pulse soil water content measurements.

The development of mobile-devices with wireless network-access capabilities, together with the decrease in network-traffic costs and the proliferation of free wireless hotspots, makes the use of mobile-devices, as Internet access tools, increasingly common and attractive. With novel forms of presenting information and to provide new ways to interact with consumers, new business strategies can be boosted, in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and m-commerce. This paper describes a different approach to the relationship between customers and business-providers, based on contextualization mechanisms located in commercial products, which in turn acts as a gateway to static tag-embedded information as well as web-based information and services. A wine integrated management system, called SIGPV, is presented as a proof-of-concept, enumerating some of possible major business and CRM benefits. © 2010 Universidad de Talca - Chile.",

The tags are used to automatically associate a field location to the relevant database tables or records and also to access contextual information or services. By pointing a mobile device to a tag, the viticulturalist may download data such as climatic data or upload information such as disease and pest incidence in a simple way, without having to provide coordinates or any other references, and without having to return to a central office. This work is part of an effort to implement a large-scale distributed cooperative network in the Douro Demarcated Region in Northeast Portugal, a region in which the effort makes particular sense due to the extremely variable topography and mesoclimates. The possibility of exchanging contextualized information and accessing contextualized services in the field, using well-known devices such as cell phones, may contribute to increase the rate of adoption of information technology in viticulture, and contribute to more efficient and closer-to-the-crops practices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

This paper describes a Viticulture Service-Oriented Framework (VSOF) which turns around context elements or tags that are placed in the field and which can be decoded by mobile devices such as mobile phones or PDAs. The tags are used to automatically associate a field location to the relevant database tables or records and also to access contextual information or services. By pointing a mobile device to a tag, the viticulturalist may download data such as climatic data or upload information such as disease and pest incidence in a simple way, without having to provide coordinates or any other references, and without having to return to a central office. This work is part of an effort to implement a large-scale distributed cooperative network in the Douro Demarcated Region in Northeast Portugal, a region in which the effort makes particular sense due to the extremely variable topography and mesoclimates. The possibility of exchanging contextualized information and accessing contextualized services in the field, using well-known devices such as cell phones, may contribute to increase the rate of adoption of information technology in viticulture, and contribute to more efficient and closer-to-the-crops practices. Keywords Context-aware elements Mobile devices Ubiquity Precision viticulture Site-specific management Services platform 1 Introduction Precision viticulture (PV) in the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) is still at an early development stage despite the economic, social and environmental benefits that it could bring. The DDR is located in Northeast Portugal and consists mostly of steep hills (slopes reaching 15%) and narrow valleys that flatten out into plateaus above 400m. The Douro river digs deeply into the mountains to form its bed, the vineyards being planted in terraces fashioned from the steep rocky slopes and supported by hundreds of kilometres of dry stone wall. These terraces and very steep slopes are the dominant element of the landscape, condition the layout of the vineyards and make transportation across the region difficult (Andresen et al., 2004). The DDR remains a remote, sparsely inhabited rural region, with an economy that is largely driven by the vine – or, more precisely, by a mosaic of vineyards with very variable topography and mesoclimates, and thus is an appropriate region for development of site-specific management (SSM). Issues that are currently constraining the rate of adoption of information systems (Kitchen, 2007; Alvarez and Nuthall, 2006) include the need for applications that fit the farmers’ working patterns, rather than the dependence on data handling procedures that are unfamiliar or unavailable to the farmers, and computer illiteracy. Further, agriculture-specific frameworks are often centered in the office rather than in the field. There is a lack of in-field support tools that effectively assist farmers in their daily practices: farming is not remotely done (Burrell et al., 2004). The interaction with information technology tools should occur closer to the crops, integrated in the farmers’ daily routines, rather than a posteriori, in the office. The pursuit of in-field solutions has lead to a large number of applications for collecting, processing and providing information to farmers. These applications, while potentially capable of performing operational tasks and/or providing decision support, remain limited in terms of their use in-field, a drawback that in part follows from their very nature: they are typically conceived for personal computers, as browser or standalone applications. Some recent examples can be found in Kuflik et al. (2009), Harwood and Hadley (2009) and Thorp et al. (2008). A number of mobile-based solutions have also been discussed. However, they also exhibit limitations in the ability to access the contextual information, since typically they depend exclusively on Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates to associate activities or operations to locations. A recent example can be found in Fang and He (2008), where a Pocket PC-based in-field fast information collection system is proposed. Charvat et al. (2006) proposes the MobilDat (Mobile Data Visualization and Updating), the goal of which is to design and implement a mobile solution and mobile visualization tool for sharing and updating spatial knowledge, focusing on forestry, interoperability and standardization methods and tools for mobile data management. Hornbuckle et al. (2006) describe a Pocket PC-based decision support system, intended to be used by farmers to improve surface irrigation system performance, which uses field-based inputs of the advancing water front collected with the GPS. In the case of the DDR, the farmers’ age and their low level of technological awareness are additional obstacles that must be addressed when designing a site-specific management (SSM) application. A critical question is how SSM will affect the economic and social structure of the rural communities. There is little scientific evidence to draw from, but the existing experience about the introduction of technology in agriculture and industry may provide valuable experience (Plant, 2001). It is safe to state that usability and contextualization are two characteristics of utmost importance in the development of any such technological tools. One approach to the problem of pushing the decision level closer to the practitioner is to tag site-specific elements, and design information and decision support systems that rely on them. This approach yields a reliable mechanism to quickly look up information or initiate a site-specific action. Due to the growing computational power of mobile devices, the decoding of tags is not a problem. Visual tags that depend on image processing algorithms are replacing the well-known EAN13 barcodes because of their ability to handle more data per tag area. Indeed, 2D visual tags and mobile devices are already being used in many activities. The traceability system described by (Seine et al., 2004) adopted 2D visual tags because they were the cheapest and they performed better in water environments than other identification (ID) technologies. The decoding can be made using widely available mobile devices, which gives consumers easy access to the product information and increases their confidence. Ampatzidis and Vougioukas (2009) have evaluated the use of RFID and barcode technologies in manual fruit harvesting to improve traceability. The feasibility of using linear and 2D barcodes was also explored by Froschle et al. (2009) in connection with poultry. The aim of this work is to promote open-source and easy-to-use PV decision support and management services that eventually bridge the gap between in-field practices and office-centered applications. For this one needs real-time contextualized in-field information, which can be obtained by using everyday “on-hands” technology in an innovative way. There is no shortage of applications. In fact, this work was partly motivated by the number of daily viticultural tasks that can be effectively addressed through the use of information technologies. For instance, fixing in each vineyard parcel a contextualization tag containing predefined static information about the parcel and an encoded Uniform Resource Locator (URL) makes real-time vineyard management a future reality. In this case, the tag data can be used to index remote web-based information and services; or it can be used as an entry point to a SSM application. By pointing his mobile device to the tag, the viticulturalist associates his position in the field with the database data. The association may work for upload as well as for download. The tag ensures that any data uploaded in the field becomes automatically associated with the correct database tables or records and, similarly, any data downloaded from the database will automatically match the viticulturalist's position in the field. For example, it is known that phytosanitary treatments and human intervention should take place as soon as any anomalies are detected (Magalhães, 1989; Fregoni, 1999). In fact, the underlying problems can often be predicted by the farmers, who draw on their accumulated experience and the relevant climatic data, which plays a key role. After pointing his mobile device to the tag, the viticulturalist may access the climatic parameters (humidity, temperature, etc.) at the current location; he may then upload any relevant observations or conclusions to the database – without having to worry about linking the data to a field location. This is of interest whenever data obtained on-site (disease and pest incidence, yield, etc.) needs to be uploaded to a database, or when the database has to be queried in reference to a particular field location. The automatic contextualization provided by the tags not only simplifies the viticulturalist task, but also reduces the response time and essentially eliminates the risk of input errors and database inconsistencies. The goal of this paper is to show how mobile devices and identification tags can be combined to render contextualized information and services to support in-field PV management practices. Section 2 overviews 1D barcodes or linear barcodes, 2D visual tags and Near Field Communications (NFC) compliant tags as key technologies to identify in-field elements and to access site-specific services. Section 3 presents the developed proof-of-concept framework application, which supports the vineyard practices. System architecture, client interface and the service-oriented platform are presented in Section 4. The fifth section draws conclusions, discusses what can be achieved with this approach and reveals some of the future work that is being undertaken to integrate these tools in a wider cooperative network. 2 Mobile devices and tags According to Plant (2001), when a new technology is introduced in a field of activity the demands placed on the workers’ skills increase. Mobile devices, mainly cell phones, are embedded in daily routines and represent the most common and widely used technology today. This suggests that educational level is not a severe barrier to their use and their adoption for site-specific management of vineyards may contribute to increase the technological awareness of the potential of PV, particularly in the DDR. Studies have shown that in Portugal, at the first quarter of 2009, the cell phone/person ratio was 140.6%, which is approximately 20% above the European Union average (ICP-ANACOM, 2009). As a rule, everyone carries at least one mobile device. This wide availability makes the cell phone an ideal tool for interacting with information technology and on-demand services. This idea gets reinforced by the current evolution trends in mobile devices, which suggest an enormous potential in using these devices to support PV management practices. For these reasons, mobile devices can be a key technology to promote ubiquity in PV by accessing data and related services. Fig. 1 illustrates the expected scenario, in which a viticulturalist uses its mobile device to access on-demand services and perform several activities that rely on the interaction between the in situ user and the office back-end. 2.1 Tag-based identification technologies Tags, as a machine-readable representation of data (Gao et al., 2007), have been largely used to represent data and to link physical objects to digital information. There are several tag-based ID technologies, such as barcodes, visual tags and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags that in combination with an easy-to-use on-the-fly decoding system yields an effective, powerful and innovative way of providing contextualized information and on-demand services. Table 1 shows a comparison between different types of tag-based identification technologies. Found almost everywhere, 1D barcodes, linear barcodes or simply barcodes are a tag-based identification technology that has the capability to store and represent data through parallel lines of different widths. They are massively used in retail commerce where a manufacturer can assign a Unique Identifying Number (UID) to a product, making automatic product management, tracking and inventory possible. In addition, a relational database can be created to relate this UID to relevant product information. Two-dimensional or 2D barcodes represent another early step in the tag systems technological evolution. They have emerged as the natural way to encode large quantities of alphanumeric data and to link objects to web-based information and services, through the encoding of an URL (Toye et al., 2005; Parikh and Lazowska, 2006; Rekimoto and Ayatsuka, 2000). Among the most significant 2D visual tags implementations are QR Code, PDF417, DataMatrix and MaxiCode. Table 2 summarizes their main characteristics. The QR Code open-source solution emerges as the most suitable solution for applications that require the decoding of large quantities of alphanumeric data and fast scan speeds (Chaisatien and Akahori, 2006). RFID is another well-known technology used in identification tags. It is often applied to a product for identification or tracking purposes. Although a very promising possibility, the massive incorporation of RFID tag readers in mobile devices remains unlikely in the near future (Seine et al., 2004; Toye et al., 2005; Falas and Kashani, 2007). Furthermore, despite the massive cost reductions of the past decade, RFID is still not cost-efficient for a variety of targets (Roussos and Kostakos, 2009). Nevertheless, mobile devices able to read RFID tags are emerging in the market, in the hope of simplifying the interaction between users and services and providing a contactless and secure payment method, e-ticketing being a likely application (VISA, 2009); It employs a technology known as Near Field Communication that stands for a new, short-range wireless technology evolved from a combination of existing contactless identification and interconnection technologies (Forum, 2009). The embedding of such technology in mobile devices will make available to the general public powerful contextualization mechanisms. It may also contribute to the goal of having a generic RFID reader embedded in each mobile device, pushing new solutions to product-based services. 2.2 Mobile devices as a tag decoding tool There are two distinct approaches to the decoding of linear barcodes. The first relies on optical scanners and is based on widely available, well established infrared technology. The scanners read data encoded by lines and spaces of different widths. The second approach is based on the digital processing of the scanned image. But optical scanners, although often used as readers, are not yet widespread among the general public and remain unsuitable for daily, in-field agricultural tasks. In contrast, decoding software able to operate on scanned images or on real-time images is becoming available on an increasing number of mobile platforms with built-in cameras and Java support. This makes them powerful tools for reading barcode data and associating them with products and services. Several barcode readers are freely available: i-enigma, Semacode, Kayva and UpCode, among others. In fact, the trend is to offer mobile devices and smartphones with built-in scanning software for linear and also 2D barcodes (Ebner, 2008). The decoding of 2D barcodes is typically performed by visual inspection systems to achieve a very high data decoding rate. This is important for sensitive applications like airport luggage control and the handling of passenger boarding passes (ITSC, 2008). The use of mobile devices with built-in cameras to read 2D barcodes is currently a popular research topic with several practical applications (Rouillard, 2008). Java software running on mobile devices and smartphones for coding and decoding 2D barcodes, such as QR Code, Semacodes, and DataMatrix, already exist and are freely available, making them a consensual answer (Rohs and Gfeller, 2004; Falas and Kashani, 2007) to the low cost decoding problem. RFID technology requires a rather different methodology to decode RFID tags since it relies on radio-frequency data transfer between two devices. To this effect, the reader and the tag exchange data through an inductive coupling that is also used for powering the passive tag. RFID readers can also work as standalone devices that communicate with a host system through some sort of interface (Roussos and Kostakos, 2009). This technology has evolved to mobile devices through the use of NFC. One of the very first commercial cell phones to incorporate this technology is the Nokia 6212 Classic model, which may contribute decisively to a more widespread use of RFID-based solutions. The fact that mobile devices are becoming able to decode 1D and 2D barcodes as well as RFID tags shows the potential of the devices in the context of ubiquitous precision viticulture. Mobile devices have reached a stage of development that makes them potentially able to support on-demand services and to assist in a number of management tasks in precision viticulture. 3 Framework for viticulture management services The Viticulture Service-Oriented Framework (VSOF) intends to overcome the general difficulties that occur when engineering and agronomics are brought together. The VSOF is a framework that supports some common PV practices, by means of a comprehensive approach based on farmers’ day-to-day routines, across all seasons and pushing SSM tools to the field. This is carried out with the help of a friendly interface specifically developed to be used in mobile devices, accelerating in situ information processing. An overview of the proposed VSOF architecture is depicted in Fig. 2 , which illustrates the interaction between the contextualization and/or indexing elements and the remote services platform. The VSOF framework uses visual and NFC tags, as well as GPS coordinates, to render contextual or indexed on-demand services related to tagged objects or products. The principle of operation is simple, and depends only on the availability of suitable decoding technology on the used mobile device. For instance, when a certain parcel of vines needs to be specified in order to obtain some information, GPS coordinates can be used, if available. Otherwise, if the parcel has been indexed by a 2D barcode (similar to the one depicted in Fig. 1), the mobile application can decode the visual tag and supply the required information. Furthermore, the 2D barcode can even be replaced by a NFC tag and still convey the required information. Although the decoding of multiple tag technologies is supported by the same software application, QR Codes and NFC tags provide additional and powerful features. On one hand, these elements can be used as a service indexing mechanism; on the other, they can also be used to store specific and static information, being decoded offline by the same software application. The VSOF framework is very flexible, and the process of rendering dynamic information and services that builds upon the tagged elements is almost straightforward. The mobile device application only has to use the decoded tag information to access a cooperative knowledge-based system where an information repository is accessed through HTTP requests. In the case of 2D barcodes and NFC tags, additional data processing is unnecessary since the capacity of these tags is sufficient to store a complete URL. However, linear barcodes and GPS coordinates do not have this ability. The difficulty can be circumvented by an additional procedure, by means of which an unique related URL is generated.The connection between the mobile device application and the information repository is always needed whenever a real-time interaction is required. This can be accomplished using any wireless technology such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), 802.11x or Bluetooth, whatever is available at the moment in the mobile device surrounding environment. For in-field operation, the user can also access the remote repository by using any specific access point, if available in range (deployed as an in-field cluster-head and gateway for wireless sensor networks, as described in a previous work (Morais et al., 2008), equipped with a 802.11 access point and Bluetooth). Offline operation is also possible with all the four supported indexing technologies. To this effect, the user can store tag information and/or GPS coordinates and postpone operation until connected. 3.1 The use of context mechanisms in PV practices The feasibility of the above referenced contextualization mechanisms has been successfully evaluated in PV environments for more than one year, using the experimental application prototype and VSOF. The simplest linear barcode is embedded in all products used in phytosanitary treatments, which is used to access useful and important information about the product and its prescription. In addition, the developed application can be used to decode bottle linear barcodes for tracking purposes as well as to retrieve information about grapes and parcels from where that wine was produced. 2D barcodes (specifically QR Codes and DataMatrix) have been also used to convey dynamic information. The additional level of indirection brings one additional benefit: the use of the same printed tag. Besides vineyard grapes and bard identification (which is regarded as static information, thus being obtained directly from the tag) QR Codes have been used in a management application of vintage tub rentals, where they are used to track tubs (Fig. 3 ). With several free online sites to encode data in QR Code format (for instance in these tags are being used in many other applications where static information is required as well as URLs to access dynamic services. Specific canopy management, farm integrated management and data entry points to SSM tools are among the most used applications of QR Codes under our PV perspective, where GPS has often to be discarded due to its lack of resolution.However, GPS coordinates remain useful for other purposes. They have been used to register the in-field variability as geographically encoded data, or to record points at which phytosanitary products have been used. Many other applications of GPS are described in the literature. The examples include yield measurement systems (Auernhammer et al., 1994) and ground speed measurement in variable-rate application equipment (Neményi et al., 2003; Keskin and Say, 2006). Since the use of NFC technology requires a new device, its use in agronomics is limited to applications where this technology presents an important key advantage over barcodes. Visual codes can be decoded by a mobile device equipped with a camera, but NFC tags may be written by a compliant device. This distinctive factor makes the NFC system a complement to the range of available tag technologies that can be used to access the VSOF. To this effect, the feasibility of using NFC tags in oak tanks or barrels in a wine aging management application in a DDR wine cellar is being evaluated. In this scenario, a NFC compliant device has been used not only to obtain winemaking related data but also to update tag information after performing operations on the barrel such as the dates of each analytical control and wine corrections. This is going one step beyond the passive tag, which simply associates data and position. In this case the tag is already an active element, able to work as a data destination instead of a mere data source. 3.2 The VSOF object model The VSOF follows the physical representation of a whole-basis farm, and is an UML (Unified Modeling Language) class model. It represents the conceptual overview of the management framework main classes and translates the physical construction of a vineyard main objects. These classes are the main entities that support the core of vineyard in-field information system. Fig. 4 presents the simplified diagram of this model. The main class is the Farm object, composed by parcels (similar to a vineyard management zone), which in turn are a composition made from bards which are composed by vines (canopies). There can be several viticulturists working on a farm, so the Viticulturist class supports this association and an authentication process. This example focuses the available services associated to the selected parcel, such as phytosanitary treatments and vineyard interventions, each one described by its own class. For example, the PhytosanitaryTreatments class translates applied parcels’ phytosanitary treatments and has three generalizations: Diseases, Plagues and Anomalies classes, each one translating a different vineyard treatment. 3.3 Mobile device application The mobile device application is the VSOF client software (called the Viticulture Management Mobile Client – VMMC). This client software performs three major functions: (i) tag decoding, (ii) association of tag data to an application item and (iii) accessing and interacting with the VSOF by issuing specific HTTP requests and receiving the contextualized HTTP responses. Full access to VSOF services is limited to registered users. Guests may use the VSOF platform to access public data and tourism services. The VMMC application starts with the user authentication. Personal info may be stored in a RecordStore (RS), which is also used to store the user profile. The functional overview of the VMMC application is depicted in Fig. 5 . The decoding engine is responsible for retrieving tag and/or GPS data from the corresponding Application Programming Interface (API). To allow barcode decoding, the selected device must support the Mobile Media Application Programming Interface (MMAPI), or simply Java Specification Request 135 (JSR-135), that enables access to native multimedia services. JSR-135 support is available in virtually every mobile device with a built-in camera. After selecting 2D or 1D barcodes capture mode, the VMMC application seeks for a valid pattern. During this phase, several recognition scans are performed. If a tag is not detected, an auto-zoom request is issued and the process is repeated. If JSR-135 is not supported in a specific device model, the application can load a captured photo and decode it in an offline mode. NFC support is provided by Java JSR-257, which is a standardized API that enables NFC applications to control the NFC interface. In a NFC compliant device, data from the JSR-257 API is handled by the VMMC in the same way JSR-135 is. At this stage of NFC technology integration, the interest of using these tags is to contextualize PV management tools, with the aim of in a near future integrating e-commerce tools and secured-based services that may assist these practices. The VMMC application also allows the use of GPS coordinates to index an open-field location and is thus suitable for retrieving a location-based VSOF service. To support the use of a GPS receiver, the mobile device must support JSR-82 as the common interface to an optional GPS external receiver. Embedded GPS receivers are supported by JSR-179 API that also supports external devices using, for instance, a Bluetooth connection. In the case of linear barcodes and GPS, the VMMC generates a specific HTTP request, where such data are used to index a related set of available services. 2D barcodes and NFC compliant tags may be used to store structured data, such as static information about tagged product, URLs or both. Following the flowchart of Fig. 5, and after the decoding or retrieving GPS coordinates, the VMMC generates a specific URL to access the remote VSOF server. While 2D barcodes and NFC compliant tags can be used to store structured data such as static information about tagged product, URLs or both, linear barcodes and GPS coordinates do not store a valid URL. In those cases, the VMMC application generates a specific HTTP request, where such data is used to index a related set of available services. To this effect, the application issues the appropriate HTTP request (the context key in Fig. 5) to VSOF, through the device native browser. The HTTP response from the VSOF (the required service in Fig. 5) is a web-page generated accordingly with the tag context, being different for each tag. In addition, information management, such as general-purpose data entry capabilities are also provided, as part of the interaction between the viticulturalist and the VSOF. Static information, such as text messages, stored in 2D and NFC compliant tags, are presented directly on the mobile device display. Table 3 shows two examples of URL generation based on 1D barcodes and GPS coordinates, either for VSOF registered users and public access. The VMMC application prototype was tested with the Nokia models N73, N80, N95 and 6212 Classic, HTC model Touch, Samsung model Omnia and SonyEricsson model K800i mobile devices. According to the Java specifications, any mobile device compliant with the specification CLDC 1.0 (Connected Limited Device Configuration) and MIDP 2.0 (Mobile Information Device Profile) has the minimum requirements to run the VMMC application. The installation procedure of the prototype management application requires it to be transferred once to the target mobile device, through any available data transfer technology. 4 Site-specific management application prototype To promote ubiquity within our PV scenario a site-specific management application, that serves as proof-of-concept for the VSOF, has been developed. The main goal was to illustrate the feasibility of using different tags to contextualize on-demand services, available in a cooperative knowledge-based network. It was conceived to help DDR viticulturalists and winemakers to register and read, in situ, site-specific information about vineyard management, including interventions and treatments. Simultaneously, an image upload and storage service was also implemented as a part of an automatic disease detection system. This particular feature allows an automatic picture-to-location indexing service which may be useful to register interventions and other vine characteristics. Fig. 6 gives an overview of the implemented services available in-field through the use of VMMC and VSOF. Fig. 6(a) shows a photograph of the starting page of the VMMC application, where there are presented the technologies supported by the mobile device for tag decoding. In this case, the VMMC is running on a Nokia N73 mobile device which has JSR-135 support only (NFC support and GPS data are not available in this model). To demonstrate the feasibility of using the VMMC application to register and read relevant information about wine corrections, the VSOF has been complemented with an oak barrels management application for a wine cellar, which uses NFC compliant tags to store winemaking data on the barrels themselves. For each barrel, Fig. 6(b) shows the available options in the VMMC application, running on a NFC compliant mobile device (Nokia 6212 Classic), with the following brief descriptions (translated from Portuguese): • Registo de entrada (Input record): Wine grape varieties and date when cask was filled. • Controlo analítico (Laboratory tests): Analytical tests performed and dates (pH, sugar contents, percent alcohol, available sulfur, acidity, among others). • Registo de correcções (Wine corrections): Fining agents and preservatives used during the wine aging process. • Histórico (History): Last month operations history records. To further demonstrate the feasibility of VMMC/VSOF for in-field management practices, a set of services that are contextualized by any available indexing mechanisms (Fig. 6(c) and (d)) has been implemented. Fig. 6(c) illustrates how the weekly inspections that need to be carried out on vines are managed. This is a textual input example: the user can register some common grape wine disease checks such as the caterpillars of the vine moth (traça da uva, Phalaenoides glycine), one of the most common pests of the grape vine, green sharpshooter (cigarrilha verde, Draeculacephala minerva) counts per leaf and the mean number of rust mites (acariose, Calepitrimerus vitis) per bud. As always, when a tag is decoded or GPS coordinates are used, all subsequent services are automatically contextualized, without the need for any further in-field element processing. Besides helping viticulturists’ daily in-field operations, this management tool can also provide a helpful scheduling mechanism for vineyard interventions and help to predict the occurrence of future vineyard's phenological states, through a continuous analysis of in-field registered data and interventions. Moreover, it can generate automatic reminders when a particular operation should be done. Fig. 7 shows a screen capture of the user management application interface VSOF. This interface is based on the Google Maps API, showing the position of each vineyard tag, each one corresponding to an entry point in the VSOF database. By double-clicking each tag, a balloon pops-up showing the most recent data uploaded by the VMMC application. Along with the photo and link provided to the climate data, available in the Info tab, the VSOF tab displays all the data regarding the selected parcel interventions. This MySQL database is managed using the well-known, open-source front end, phpMyAdmin, Fig. 8 . This data repository materializes one year of continuous recording of in-field operations, yielding a valuable experience and a sustained approach for the framework and prototype validation. In the example illustrated in Fig. 8, the SQL query was generated to retrieve all interventions regarding vineyard ID=00342 for the 2007/2008 season. 5 Conclusions and final remarks The feasibility of an integrated framework that supports the daily activities of viticulturalists in the field has been demonstrated. The system combines contextualization elements (tags) placed in the vines with readers based on widely available mobile devices. This circumvents one problem shared by many decision support tools and farm management applications: the gap between the computer-based management, carried out in the office, and the farm interventions, obviously accomplished in the field. Since in the target region (the DDR, in Northeast Portugal) the required mobile devices are very common, their need does not represent a strong or artificial constraint. In fact, given the level of computer illiteracy in the region, these mobile devices are the technology with which more farmers are highly familiar. In addition to this, usability and design issues – although not our main concern – have been carefully addressed. The implementation of the proposed SSM tools represents a major step forward in bridging the gap between the farmers and their requirements and the technology offered to them. The potential applications of the presented framework as a site-specific management tool for PV practices have been highlighted and a comprehensive set of prototype applications, that enhance the usability and usefulness of mobile devices in agricultural applications, has been presented. By embedding these “handy” tools in everyday agricultural practices, the vision of a truly ubiquitous, technology-intense PV can become a reality. One innovative aspect behind the VMMC application is its multi-tag technology decoding support, which is an important advantage when tagging or indexing different objects to initiate a site or object specific action. Towards the integration of agricultural tools in one framework, the VMMC application can also be used, without changes, in many other tasks, such as public information services or other contextualized data entry points within the whole-farm concept. Yet another advantage of tagging in-field key points follows from the dynamic nature of the information delivered. Indeed, new services can easily be added at the VSOF server side without changing the tags. As a result, the same VMMC application becomes capable of offering new contextualized services. For example, the end-user could request the weather data at a certain point, according to the closest sensors of a wireless sensor network (Morais et al., 2008). The continuing technological advances in mobile devices and their user interfaces may in the near future suggest new directions for research or answers to difficulties met today. Usability and user interface are certainly one of the areas in which more work should be done, accompanying the evolving technology (consider the iPhone and Voice Control, for example). As for the difficulties, it has been noticed that some LCD screens become difficult to read outdoors, in bright sunlight. Transflective displays, however, do not show this problem: they depend on LED backlighting indoors but have a reflective surface that produces very readable images even under direct sunlight. This technology will improve the usability of the described system and help to boost its rate of adoption. The work described is part of a long-term effort to introduce PV in the DDR. The outstanding characteristics of the region, marked by a deep symbiosis between wine and tourism, makes it an excellent test bed for innovative management techniques applied both to PV practices and tourism services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which in-field site-specific management concepts based on tags are applied to viticulture environments. However, the connection between the wine and tourism in the DDR region opens a wide range of possibilities: since most of the farms support wine tourism, the tags could be used by tourists to access public information and commercial services. The results so far are being truly encouraging. The flexibility of the proposed framework has revealed a potential that remains largely untapped, and is currently being explored to support PV and offer a number of additional benefits, such as e-commerce, tourism and other location-based services.

Indeed, such relationship appears to be quite complex, within IT contexts, and especially in socially and technologically rich learning environments, where related skills and learning are progressively required and fostered. Thus, if a satisfactory level of intellectual performance and social competence of a primary school pupil is indeed highly dependent on the type of participation that parents offer their children, IT, in general, and Internet, in particular, may well provide a new paradigm, setting forth that education and communication approach is truly more complex than ever before. It is on the basis of such paradigm that we therefore present a case study where a set of multimedia exercises were used in order to possibly improve the mathematical skills of pupils, one with mental retardation and another with cerebral palsy. Being part of a Web-based system to support students' learning, the referred set of multimedia exercises proved to be the children's favorite, rather than exercises in paper form, which also led the children to show a fair more positive attitude towards learning. Also, we observed that through the mentioned multimedia exercises, the children became far more autonomous, interested, persistent, happy, and able to easily absorb the material as well as more willingly to continue on working. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.",

This paper describes an improved micro-power electric generator where energy harvested from human movements is used as an everlasting mechanical energy source to suffice smart hip implant electronics power needs. Its architecture is designed so that the mechanical energy promotes the movement of a combination of magnets and a spring embedded inside a Teflon tube, used to reduce friction. The changing magnetic field induces current in two coils so that the output of the generator is the sum of their signals. The end result is like a double generator in one casing. Produced electrical energy is stored in an energy reservoir handed over to a power management module. Experimental results shows that energy harvested from human walking can be used as an effective power source for hip prosthesis implants.

        "doc_abstract": "Biomedical implantable devices in real-time telemetry applications offer many advantages to study and monitor physiologic parameters in human and animal bodies. As in power-constrained implantable devices, batteries and wires are two key issues that usually compromise their application. Inductive coupling is a well-established technology because it replaces simultaneously the wired connection and avoids the use of batteries. In stand-alone applications that requires total freedom of movements, this technology may present some constrains. On the other hand, very-low power electronics, advanced energy harvesting techniques and smaller implantable rechargeable batteries makes now possible the conception of fully autonomous implantable devices. This paper describes an activation circuit used to completely turn-off battery-powered implantable devices. In addition, it allows the reception of embedded commands, suitable for calibration and sensor selection purposes. Results from an experimental device to be used in a smart hip prosthesis telemetry system for loosening detection shows the usefulness of the proposed activation concept. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Fig. 1 Illustration of the proposed activation circuit in a smart hip prosthesis for loosening detection purposes. The implantable telemetry system is externally activated and/or configured using a control unidirectional link provided by a handheld device. Prosthesis sensors data is then transmitted to a receiver device using a separate data link, which may be powered by a rechargeable battery or other power source. Fig. 2 Generic operation rules for a stand-alone implantable system. Fig. 3 The implantable dual-link telemetry system block diagram. A control link, based on inductive coupling, is used to activate/deactivate and configure the main telemetry system. Fig. 4 Principle of operation of the activation concept. After a small period of time, needed to charge the internal capacitors, the transmitter sends a 6-byte embedded command that is validated to enable the DPS to wake-up and take control of its own energy source. Fig. 5 The activation subsystem block diagram. Fig. 6 Emitter circuit as a handheld device used to activate, configure and control a smart implant during the patient’s orthopaedic visits. This system may use a keypad to generate specific commands to explore, for instance, a particular sensor response at a selected sampling rate, or a RFID reader to retrieve prosthesis serial number. Fig. 7 The ASK receiver circuitry and data recovery module. Two supercapacitors are charged using the energy recovered from the incoming magnetic field when transmitting a control command, to allow the brief operation of the activation and configuration procedure.

Biomedical implantable devices in real-time telemetry applications offer many advantages to study and monitor physiologic parameters in human and animal bodies. As in power-constrained implantable devices, batteries and wires are two key issues that usually compromise their application. Inductive coupling is a well-established technology because it replaces simultaneously the wired connection and avoids the use of batteries. In stand-alone applications that requires total freedom of movements, this technology may present some constrains. On the other hand, very-low power electronics, advanced energy harvesting techniques and smaller implantable rechargeable batteries makes now possible the conception of fully autonomous implantable devices. This paper describes an activation circuit used to completely turn-off battery-powered implantable devices. In addition, it allows the reception of embedded commands, suitable for calibration and sensor selection purposes. Results from an experimental device to be used in a smart hip prosthesis telemetry system for loosening detection shows the usefulness of the proposed activation concept. Keywords Telemetry Biomedical implant Smart prosthesis Activation circuit 1 Introduction Loosening in hip prosthesis is the dominant issue for many patients who undergo a hip arthroplasty. Instrumented and telemeterized prosthesis with embedded electronics and communications capabilities provide an excellent tool to detect early and minimal loosening [1,2], which justifies the increasing number of implantable electronic devices [3]. The conception and implementation of such a telemetry system follows some key specifications, such as the frequency of use, the system lifetime and power requirements, the wireless coverage range as well as safety issues. Among these specifications, system lifetime remains a critical issue when considering a permanent implant. As scientifically evidenced in [4,5], the first 2 years of the migration pattern of prosthesis can be used to predict late aseptic loosening, which is the most common failure scenario. Monitoring loosening during this period of time gives a perspective of the success of the implant, but keeping the monitoring function for the implant lifetime gives important readings about the behavior of the prosthesis-cement-bone system. Therefore, an implantable telemetry system should remain fully functional during the lifetime of the implant. Prosthesis materials also imposes severe constrains to the embedded electronics. For safety and reliability reasons, metal based prosthesis are among the most used but recent advances in biomaterials led to the development of new multi-material prosthesis designs [6]. These are composed by a metal core surrounded by a flexible controlled stiffness composite structure, with the aim of addressing simultaneously, within certain restrictions, stress shielding and micromotion [7]. In these composite prosthesis, polyether-etherketone (PEEK) is frequently used as an alternative to metal alloys and polymeric high density polyethylene is used to seal the components, since it does not degrade. This type of material is being used for acetabular components and if not in tribology contact, it will last for the entire life of the patient. As biocompatible polymeric materials, they can be used to create an elongated distal zone to accommodate the communication subsystem of a telemetry system. Many research work concerning implantable telemetry systems, published in the last decade, followed the inductive link approach in order to power the implant electronics. One of the main reasons is to avoid the use of batteries inside the human body [1–3,8–12]. While used for powering purposes, some systems uses this same inductive link for data transfer [3,11]. If the electronics are encapsulated metallically, power transmission must be achieved using low frequencies because higher frequencies heats up the prosthesis due to Eddy’s currents. The operation at low frequencies usually inhibit data transfer by the same link. The nature of the inductive coupling requires a magnetic field, generated by an external coil, which suggests that an external device must be present every time that a sensor reading is needed, which may have the disadvantage of limiting patient’s movements. In addition, monitoring applications in free moving animals also presents a challenge because animals usually do not cooperate with electronics. Recent battery chemistry developments [13,14] and advances in energy harvesting techniques [15–18] are broadening new telemetry solutions. An emerging approach to embed electronics in implants is to combine the advantages of the well-established inductive link technology with an energy harvesting and storage system. This combination may be accomplished by means of an activation circuit, powered and controlled momentarily by an inductive link, which is responsible for powering a separate, unidirectional, telemetry system. When not in operation, the energy harvested from vibration sources may be employed to replenish the system’s energy storage. Fig. 1 illustrates the use of the envisaged telemetry system in a femoral prosthesis. Before medical evaluation, the activation circuit is briefly energized by an handheld device, thus activating the associated telemetric device. During this procedure, the telemetric system may be configured to perform a specific data acquisition procedure or to select a specific sensor used in the loosening detection. After the activation, and during the data acquisition process, the patient performs a treadmill evaluation in order to obtain prosthesis embedded sensors’ response to walking forces. During the evaluation, sensor’s data are wirelessly transmitted to a small medical receiver unit, located at the patient belt, that could operate as a gateway to other network infrastructures [19,20]. After loosening evaluation, system can then be completely deactivated. In our research, a two-sensing methodology have been followed in loosening and subsidence monitoring. One is based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors and the other based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors [21], both coated with a biocompatible polymer, with satisfactory results during standard fatigue tests evaluation. In addition, both have passed the ISO 10993-01 regulations (Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices) and proved that when in direct contact with bone cells they do not inhibit their proliferation. This paper is organized as follows: after this introductory section, where a review of inductive coupling telemetry systems and smart hip prosthesis was accomplished, Section 2 describes the remote activation concept and highlight is given to the system overview and principle of operation. Within this context, our vision of a telemetry system using two unidirectional communication links, the control link and a data link, is described. The first one is for activation and configuration purposes and the other one is used by the implantable system to send data samples to a receiver device for further processing. Section 3 describes the hardware used in the experimental set-up proof of concept. The transmission and reception modules related with the control link are described as well as is the data recovery module. In the fourth section, all experimental procedures that led to the activation circuit characterization are described. The conclusions and the work that is underway are discussed in Section 5, which closes the paper. 2 The dual-link telemetry system An implantable system for a specific data gathering purpose may be regarded as a device that takes a digital sample of a sensor signal and transmits the acquired data wirelessly to a base station or to a gateway for further processing. To keep this system as simple as possible as a way to reduce size and power consumption, operation rules may be extremely simple as those described in the generic flowchart of Fig. 2 . In this example, and for every sampling period timeout, the device wakes up, executes the acquisition and transmission processes and enters again in a deep sleep mode, for the device lifetime. In addition, such a system may have only a unidirectional link to further reduce complexity and power consumption of the whole system. For battery-operated systems, in particular those that might harvest energy from the surrounding environment, the shut-off and activation procedure are key issues, since it may enable perpetual operation of the implant. This is somewhat important in applications where an inductive link may impose serious difficulties, such the cases of freely moving animals, e.g. cows and sheep, that usually do not cooperate with electronics. Fig. 3 shows the block diagram regarding our conception of a dual-link telemetry system. The complete implantable system is divided in two separate functional blocks: a data processing subsystem (DPS), that transmits data samples and the inductive unidirectional link, referred in Fig. 3 as the System Activator, that is used to control the DPS. Upon reception of a specific command, that activates the entire system, and at a selected configuration, the data processing module starts the execution of the flowchart of Fig. 2, i.e., acquiring and transmitting sensors’ data to a nearby reception unit for posterior data analysis. The activation (or awaking procedure) is accomplished using two power switches, one activated by the control link upon reception of a wake-up command, and the other switch controlled by the data processing block after taking control. The main objective of this subsystem is to provide a simple, yet reliable, mechanism of wirelessly activate an implantable device with an embedded command structure. In our experimental smart prosthesis telemetry system, the sensor matrix (referred in Fig. 3) is composed of four PVDF transducers (FDT1-052F, Measurement Specialties, USA). The analog front-end is based on a precision peak detector circuit that periodically holds the maximum response of the PVDF to external forces, and a 18-bit, differential input, Delta-Sigma analog-to-digital converter (MCP3421, Microchip, USA) that samples the held signal. Afterwards, the sampling capacitor is discharged through an electronic switch. Data processing is accomplished by a low-power microcontroller (PIC16LF628A, Microchip, USA). At this development stage, the RF transmitter is based on a RF class-E emitter but a simpler design regarding the matching impedance network could be used such as an Colpitts oscillator. 2.1 The activation concept The system activator, as a stand-alone circuit, must have its own power source. This is accomplished by harvesting energy from the inductive link and charging a capacitor. Fig. 4 illustrates the waveforms related to the activation subsystem. When the emitter is in range with the control link coil, the activation circuit becomes powered by a supercapacitor as an energy reservoir, replenished by the received energy. When this capacitor is charged, which takes a few seconds, the activation circuit becomes ready to receive incoming commands. Each command is encapsulated in a 6-byte wide data frame containing a preamble and checksum control fields, accordingly with Fig. 4. These control fields are used by the receiver circuit to detect the start-of-frame and error check of the incoming data, respectively. The 2-byte SerialID field contains the prosthesis serial number and it is used by the receiver to validate the incoming command. The commandfield contains the transmitted command with an optional argument in the parameterfield. Table 1 gives a short description of the used commands. After command validation, the power switch is turned on, thus connecting the DPS to the battery. After the short DPS start-up time, it takes control of the other power switch running until the reception of a shutdown command or by an internal timer. 2.2 System overview The entire block diagram of the proposed activation subsystem is illustrated in Fig. 5 . It comprises the receiver LC tank circuit, an ASK demodulator, a power management section and the access control module, responsible for handling incoming data. In order to get the necessary energy to enable a brief operation of this autonomous circuit, the incoming magnetic field is used to replenish an energy reservoir, a supercapacitor in this case, which implies a certain charging time before accepting a control command, typically a few seconds. The energy harvester and power management subsystem is responsible for managing all available energy to replenish the main energy reservoir based on a lithium ion battery. A supercapacitor is also used as a primary buffer for the battery charging process and to suffice the activation circuit power needs. In addition, this subsystem provides a regulated 3.3V power supply voltage to the activation circuit and to the DPS. Besides the energy harvested from the inductive link (that is mainly used for the activation procedure), other forms of energy must be equated to suffice the telemetry power needs. As reviewed in [22,23], vibration energy harvesting for self-powered microsystems can be accomplished by inertial spring and mass systems where energy may be extracted using piezoelectric, electromagnetic and electrostatic transduction mechanisms. For our smart prosthesis prototype, an electromagnetic generator and a cantilever piezoelectric generator are currently being evaluated as vibrational energy sources to be used in the charging process of the implantable battery. A medical-grade lithium ion battery (QL0003I, Quallion, USA) was chosen due to its unique characteristics. It is a hermetically sealed, bioimplantable battery measuring only 11.8mm length by 2.9mm diameter, weighing only 0.2g with a nominal capacity of 3mAh. Quallion’s 5A2 chemistry has been validated to last 25 years in the human body. In addition, it employs the proprietary Zero-Volt™ technology meaning that the battery can reach 0 V and still be able to be charged again with only a very small loss of capacity [14]. It also allows the battery to be left floating when charge is completely removed for long periods of time and inside the human body. These electrical characteristics and very small volume make this battery suitable for our envisaged energy harvesting and storage system. The access control subsystem is basically a data recovery module with a validation procedure. In our prototype, this module was built around a low-power microcontroller (PIC10F206-I/OT, Microchip, USA) which is responsible for data decoding, command validation, power switch control and serial interface with the DPS. This last feature is of extreme importance because enables signaling of the DPS with the transmitted command. 3 Hardware implementation To evaluate the proposed activation concept, we ventured in the development of a macro-device in the context of an ongoing smart hip prosthesis research project. The experimental set-up comprises an emitter unit and an ASK receiver with a data recovery module based on a low-cost, low-power microcontroller. This section analyzes the hardware implementation of the experimental set-up. 3.1 Handheld emitter device The handheld device is based on a class-E emitter being primarily designed to provide the control unidirectional link. It is intended to be used by the medical staff to transmit control commands and to power the remote activation circuitry following the inductive coupling technique. As depicted in Fig. 6 , this unit comprises a class-E RF power amplifier and a low-cost microcontroller (PIC16LF629, Microchip, USA) for command generation and data encoding, as well as an RFID reader interface as a practical way to retrieve prosthesis serial number and patient medical records. The class-E topology was chosen due to its inherent high efficiency operation [24]. The 6-byte wide control frame is generated by the microcontroller device and encoded using the Manchester scheme. The Manchester code has a zero DC level on a bit-by-bit basis and it is less prone to re-synchronization problems due to the fact that a string of zeros or ones will not cause a loss of the clocking signal. Data is then modulated by OOK, and transmitted with a data rate of 4800 bits/s using a 125kHz carrier. Although other methods of ASK modulation on class-E transmitters may be used, such as modifying the frequency response of the amplifier as described in [11], we have opted by switching on and off the RF switch to obtain directly an OOK modulated signal. The main reasons are related to heat dissipation in the RF switch and the relatively low-frequency carrier. In addition, the class-E topology leaves the power supply free to be adjusted, thus controlling the distance between the emitter and the implanted receiver coil to the optimum value without reaching the maximum magnetic field density allowable for living tissues, which is 164 μ T for a 125kHz carrier frequency, as referred in IEEE/ANSI c95.1 (1999) standard. 3.2 ASK receiver The receiver circuit was developed to accept control commands and simultaneously power the associated circuitry. As an independent subsystem of the whole implantable device, it must be externally powered. To accomplish this feature, the emitter must transmit sufficient energy to enable this subsystem operation during the necessary time period before the DPS takes control, as a battery-powered device. To achieve this and to keep the wireless switch autonomous, the receiver uses two supercapacitors, as its main energy reservoir, charged by the incoming magnetic field. Energy harvesting is accomplished by the two series-connected supercapacitors and two Schottky diodes as a power rectifier. The resonant circuit is implemented using the serial configuration, while this configuration delivers more current than the parallel one [11] and is less susceptible to load effects. The simplified receiver circuit is depicted in the left side of Fig. 7 . The output from the supercapacitors is then applied to a voltage regulation integrated circuit, which is used to supply all active circuits of the activation subsystem. Demodulation follows a simple, yet functional, configuration suited for this application. Signal from the LC tank circuit ( L 0 and C 0 in Fig. 7) is applied to an envelope detector ( D 3 , C 2 and R 2 ) as an OOK demodulator. For discrimination purposes, the mean value of the incoming demodulated signal is recovered by a low-pass filter ( R 3 , C 3 , R 4 and R 5 ). In order to overcome the noise injected mainly by the emitter modulation scheme and surrounding environment, a voltage divider is used before applying the mean value of the received signal to the hysteresis comparator ( IC 1 ). The output from the comparator, as the recovered ASK signal, is then delivered to the data recovery and validation module described in the following section. 3.3 Data recovery module and command validation This module is depicted in the right side of Fig. 7. The output of the comparator is actually the serial data received and applied to the input of the microcontroller ( IC 2 ) which is responsible for decoding it. The decoded data is then processed and if the data frame represents a valid command, i.e., if checksum and prosthesis serial ID are correct, the power switch is turned on by means of a microcontroller output pin. The activation implies in connecting the internal power supply, in this case a Li-ion rechargeable battery, to the implantable telemetric device represented by the ( IC 3 ) microcontroller. After being activated, the implant circuit is responsible for controlling a second switch in order to ensure its own power. After some time, the first switch is turned off. From this point forward, the DPS is responsible for its own deactivation. Deactivation can also be achieved through the serial interface (Command Serial Linein Fig. 7) between the activation circuit and the DPS, thus turning the activation circuit into a complete wireless switch. Once activated, the implant device is ready to receive other commands. 4 Experimental results and discussion To proper evaluate the remote activation circuit, an experimental set-up was created to characterize the ASK receiver and data recovery module during the development of a smart hip prosthesis telemetry system, as shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8(a) shows the experimental device that comprises the four PVDF sensing devices used to monitor loosening under several fatigue cycles. Fig. 8(b) shows a prosthesis model with the activation circuit receiver coil, which is located at the prosthesis distal end. The handheld emitter coil is also illustrated. Table 2 shows relevant data regarding coil characteristics. For the activation circuit evaluation, a specific power consumption profile was created. In this particular case, the power management module must supply a current consumption of about 600 μ A from a 3.3V power supply during 100ms, time needed by the DPS to start-up and take control of the second power switch. For evaluation purposes, the access control module was built around a 6-pin, 8-bit, low-power microcontroller in a SOT23/6 package (PIC10F206-I/OT, Microchip, USA). Power to run this device was obtained from 0.22F supercapacitors (EECS0HD224V, Panasonic, Japan) that starts charging as soon as the emitter is in range with the receiver coil. Fig. 9 shows the related waveforms. After a command transmission has been initiated (Start-of-Tx signal in Fig. 9), the handheld device starts transmitting a full-power carrier (not modulated) to fast charge the activation circuitry capacitors, which are considered to be sufficiently charged to enable system operation after approximately 8-s. In this particular case, the available energy was calculated to be approximately 11.2 J or 3.1mWh. After receiving the streaming data from the data recovery module, the microcontroller ( IC 2 of Fig. 7) checks for a valid command. In this case, an output line is set to indicate this condition to the DPS (emulated by IC 2 of Fig. 7), and the switch remains active during the time needed by the DPS to start-up and take control of it (approximately 80ms). Afterwards, the activation circuit remains ready for the next command. Fig. 10 shows some relevant waveforms during the transmission of a 6-byte wide command coded using Manchester. The maximum distance obtained without errors during the 6-byte control word reception was determined to be higher than 60mm, which corresponds to a magnetic field density of about 31 μ T with a peak current of 0.55A in the emitter coil. Assuming that the minimum distance between the receiver coil and the leg outer surface is about 40mm, the maximum magnetic field density is calculated to be 64 μ T. 5 Conclusions and final remarks In this paper we have described a new approach in the development of biomedical implantable systems. It relies on an activation system that is used to completely deactivate a battery-operated implantable system when not in use to save precious battery energy. With this approach, data transfer can occur in a dynamic way to reduce power consumption during long periods of time that the monitoring functions are not needed. By embedding control commands, the activation procedure is also useful for configuration purposes, e.g., sampling period and sensor selection. An example of usefulness of the proposed activation concept can be found in [25], where the implantable system can be completely turned-off during animal pregnancy. Experimental results have shown that the inductive link is a reliable and an effective methodology for the proposed wireless activation circuit. The series resonant circuit has allowed to recover the necessary energy for charging the supercapacitor-based power supply. The data recovery module has proven to be efficient over a wide range of distances between transmitter and receiver coils. All tests regarding the 6-byte data frame recovery were successfully performed without errors. Magnetic field density was also kept below a theoretical value of 64 μ T, well below the maximum allowable of 164 μ T for living tissues. After the concept validation and macro-prototype experiments, the complete system is now being scaled down to fit into an experimental composite hip femoral prosthesis to further estimate any biological and electronic risks that might compromise its application to humans. The activating subsystem and the analog processing chain is also being designed and simulated in a standard 0.35 μ m CMOS technology. Numerical simulation regarding piezoelectric and electromagnetic generators for human motion is being conducted to evaluate its feasibility to recharge the implantable battery with very small energy packets, which will enable the battery-operated implantable device to be fully autonomous.

Vehicles rely on the efficiency of dampers to dissipate energy from the motion of vehicle body and wheels, maintaining the vehicle more stable, and improving the contact between tires and the road surface. To achieve an effective monitoring of dampers (or shock absorbers), two different methodologies, capable of assessing, under vehicle normal operation, the condition of the automotive dampers are presented. The proposed methodologies are based in acceleration, temperature and pressure sensing to determine the shock absorber condition, and are therefore suitable for future implementation in low cost fabrication technologies. The results shown that it is possible to have an effective monitoring device, installed in the damper body, capable of continuously determining shock absorber status, and therefore enabling real time diagnosis. Such a diagnosis system can reduce the number of vehicles riding with defective suspension systems and increase the overall vehicle safety. Keywords Shock absorber Embedded system Smart sensor Vehicle safety 1 Introduction The automotive suspension plays a crucial role in vehicle safety and driving comfort. Even if isolation from road vibration is definitely a very important aim, maintaining the contact between road surface and vehicle wheels is far more essential, as the control and stability of the vehicle relies totally upon it. The suspension main components are dampers and springs, both positioned between the sprung mass (vehicle body) and the unsprung mass (wheel). Although the name shock absorber is commonly used for dampers, in reality vehicle shocks are absorbed by the deflection of the tyres and springs. The principal purpose of dampers is to dissipate energy. As the damper is compressed and extended, mechanical energy is converted into heat, damping the vehicle oscillations and improving road adhesion. However, as any other mechanical system, suspension components are subjected to wear gradually. Shock absorbers in particular, due to its physical working concept, are prone to wear with time, distance driven and working conditions and suffer other damages like oil leakage. Dampers deterioration will result in excessive vehicle oscillations as a response to road disturbances, adversely affecting vehicle comfort, drivability and safety, with increased instability and longer breaking distances. To assess the condition of shock absorbers, two methods are usually employed: dynamometer tests, which use an electric-hydraulic cylinder actuator or an electric motor, together with a crank mechanism, to run the shock absorber (that must be removed from the vehicle) through different input stimulus or sinusoidal frequencies. The measurement of the resultant force between the damper and the actuator as a function of velocity, gives accurate results and clear damper parameters identification [1–6]. On the other hand, ground suspension tests (for which shock absorber removal is not necessary) apply a shaking displacement to the tire at different frequencies and measure the tire contact force with the platform. The result, called adhesion, is a good measure of the suspension system status, but is not a sufficient indicator of the shock absorber condition [7,8]. Nozaki and Inagaki [9] presented a new concept test device capable of measuring the damping force; however, dedicated tools (vibration production device, computing unit, displacement sensor and the tire load cell) must be used, limiting the use and portability of such device. Actually, no precise method to continuously evaluate dampers under normal operation exists; therefore, methodologies were developed for determining the damper condition during vehicle normal operation, to alert the driver whenever replacement is required. The proposed methodologies can be implemented using an embedded autonomous device (which could be self-powered from the dampers scavenged energy), acquire relevant parameters and transmit them wirelessly to the automotive diagnostic electronic system. The sensing part will be developed based in MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors, based on CMOS process, allowing batch fabrication of systems with small dimension, high quality, sensitivity and reproducibility. The small size, overall feasibility and reduced cost per unit are key factors for their selection and successful application, with proved results in many automotive applications [10–14]. 2 Assessment methods In order to study different ways of measuring vehicle damper’s condition, two approaches were considered. The first consisted in the analysis of the suspension system as a whole, the second on the study of the damper internal working principles. 2.1 First method—suspension analysis A theoretical analysis of an one quarter, two degrees of freedom vehicle suspension system, Fig. 1 , was performed, considering that vibrations occur independently at each wheel. The equations for the sprung and unsprung mass ( M U and M S ) force-balance are: (1) M S x ¨ 2 = K S ( x 1 − x 2 ) + C D ( x ˙ 1 − x ˙ 2 ) M U x ¨ 1 = K T ( x 0 − x 1 ) − K S ( x 1 − x 2 ) − C D ( x ˙ 1 − x ˙ 2 ) By solving the above equations in the frequency domain, it is possible to determine the transmissibility T R , output to input magnitude ratio between M U and M S accelerations ( X ¨ 1 and X ¨ 2 ) in frequency domain: (2) T R = X ¨ 2 ( ω ) X ¨ 1 ( ω ) = 1 + ( 2 ζ r ) 2 ( 1 − r 2 ) 2 + ( 2 ζ r ) 2 T R is a function of the damping ratio, ζ , and the forcing frequency ratio, r. The damping ratio is a function of the damping factor, C D , sprung mass, M S , and the spring constant, K S , (3) ζ = 1 2 C D M S K S and r is the ratio between the excitation frequency f r and the system natural frequency f n : (4) r = f r f n In vehicle conventional passive suspension systems, the spring constant K S has little variation during vehicle life. Vehicle mass M S changes with vehicle load, this effect being more pronounced in the rear axle, as the front axle load is mainly determined by the powertrain mass (most common case: front engine mounting). The damper condition is related with the damping factor C D , so changes due to aging, wear or malfunction of the damper may be detectable by monitoring transmissibility values. As the transmissibility is directly affected by the excitation frequency, a frequency domain analysis of the transmissibility is performed in order to determine its behavior for different excitation frequencies. Therefore, as T R is a function of the damping factor, a system that measures top ( X ¨ 2 ) and bottom ( X ¨ 1 ) acceleration in the shock absorber and computes the transmissibility in the frequency domain may be used as an indicator of shock absorbers condition. 2.2 Second method—damper analysis As the above concept requires the use of two measuring points, an alternative method was developed that uses shock absorber internal pressure and wheel acceleration to determine shock absorber condition. Different models for the shock absorbers internal working principles were studied. Most of the models proposed in literature were developed to study particular features of the shock absorbers: models for using in vehicle dynamics studies [15,16], models of the dynamic characteristics for displacement-sensitive shock absorbers [17,18], thermal and heat transfer effects models [19,20], among others [21–24]. Most of the presented models require knowledge of detailed sets of the shock absorber parameters or experimentally determined parameters as a function of the results obtained in dynamometers. Therefore, a simple shock absorber model which correlates the damping properties with its main physical characteristics, internal pressures, and oil temperature was developed. Using flow continuity Eq. (5), when a chamber is compressed the displaced volume, A x ˙ , will be equal to the oil volumetric flow rate from that chamber, Q, corrected by the oil compressibility factor in the respective volume, where: V is the volume, K is the bulk modulus of oil and P is the pressure. (5) V K d P d t = A x ˙ − Q Considering the basic schematic of an internal dual-tube shock absorber as presented in Fig. 2 , it can be reduced to four main valves, two in the piston and two separating the compression chamber from the outer reservoir. Therefore, in the compression stroke, for positive values of x ˙ ( t ) , the oil flows from the compression chamber to the extension chamber, resulting in the volumetric flow rate Q CE , and due to the difference of volumes between the two main chambers, the remaining oil is forced to flow to the reservoir, Q CR . Note that the piston valve, V 3 , offers small resistance to the oil flow so, in this stroke, the shock absorber force is controlled mainly by the compression chamber to reservoir valve V 1 . In the extension stroke (negative values of x ˙ ( t ) ), oil is compressed from the extension chamber to the compression chamber, resulting in the volumetric flow rate Q EC , and as the oil coming from the extension hasn’t enough volume to fill the bigger compression chamber volume, some oil will flow from the reservoir to the compression chamber, Q RC . In this stroke the valve placed between the compression chamber and the reservoir, V 2 , offers little flow resistance, being the damping force in the extension stroke controlled mainly by the valve placed in the piston, V 4 . Considering that oil is incompressible, the oil volumetric flow rate in the four main valves could be expressed as a function of the compression and extension chambers cross section areas, A C and A E , and the piston velocity, x ˙ ( t ) : (6) Compression Q CR = ( A C − A E ) x ˙ Q CE = A E x ˙ Extension Q RC = ( A C − A E ) x ˙ Q EC = A E x ˙ Based on the Bernoulli equation: (7) Q = C d A 0 2 ρ Δ P was used to correlate the volumetric flow rate in the valves, Q, with the corresponding pressure drop, Δ P . The discharge coefficient C d depends mainly on the valves orifices geometry and Reynolds number (for automotive shock absorbers, constant value for C d around 0.6 is often used [1,15]). A 0 is the valve orifice area and ρ is the oil density. The reservoir is half filled with air/gas and sealed from the atmosphere, causing oil pressure in the reservoir, P R , to be equal to the gas pressure, P a . Therefore the reservoir oil pressure can be determined from the equation of the ideal gas, correcting the air/gas volume V a 0 with in and out flow rates from the compression chamber, Q RC and Q CR , and the variation of oil volume with temperature, Δ V Oil . The equation for the gas and reservoir oil pressure will come as: (8) P a = m a R T V a 0 − ∫ Q RC d t + ∫ Q CR d t + Δ V Oil Knowing the oil pressure in the reservoir, P R , and the flow rates through each valve is possible to obtain the corresponding pressure drops, Δ P X Y , so the pressure in the extension ( P E ), and compression chamber ( P C ), are obtained from (9) Compression P C − P R = Δ PCR P C − P E = Δ PCE Extension P E − P C = Δ PEC P R − P C = Δ PRC As oil flow between shock absorber cameras is a function of oil density, equation (10) ρ 1 = ρ 0 / ( 1 + β ( t 1 − t 0 ) ) was used to find oil density change with temperature, where ρ 1 is the final density, ρ 0 is the initial density, β is the volumetric temperature expansion coefficient, t 1 is the final temperature and t 0 is the initial temperature. The frictional forces between the piston and the inner chambers and between the piston rod and the shock absorber sealing were obtained from (11) F friction = μ A x ˙ e where A is the contact area, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the oil and e is the oil thickness between the contact surfaces. A look up table was used with the temperature/viscosity diagram for standard ISO hydraulic oils to determine changes in the oil dynamic viscosity μ with temperature. As a result, knowing the damper internal pressures, cross section areas and frictional forces, the damping force, F damping , can be obtained from: (12) F damping = P C A C − P E A E + F friction As in a shock absorber the damping factor , C D , can be obtained as a function of the damping force and excitation velocity, (13) C D = F damping x ˙ considering that dampers are usually asymmetric in operation, as damping is higher in extension than in compression [1], F damping is mainly determined by the pressure in the extension chamber, P E , and as velocity can be obtained from input acceleration, it should be possible to determine de damping factor, a measure of the damper condition, as a function of these two parameters. 2.3 Validation To know the excitation applied to shock absorbers under normal operation conditions, essays were made with different vehicles driven on multiple condition roads, measuring sprung mass acceleration (road excitation) and determining the power spectral densities. Test showed that (Fig. 3 ) there is a broad peak of excitation in the 10–15 Hz range, corresponding to the sprung mass resonance frequency. A Matlab Simulink model was developed to describe suspension behavior (Fig. 4 ), and the previously presented equations were employed for the shock absorber model. The model was used to validate the possibility of determining shock absorber condition by knowing transmissibility between sprung and unsprung mass accelerations or determining damping force by knowing wheel acceleration and pressure in the extension chamber. Broad range acceleration (0–25 Hz) was used as input, and damping force, extension chamber internal pressure and sprung mass acceleration were obtained as output. Fig. 5 shows the computed X ¨ 2 / X ¨ 1 transmissibility between the two accelerations for different condition shock absorbers. Transmissibility dependance with load and spring constant was also verified, Fig. 6 , and results showed that spring constant has little influence in the frequency range of interest, Fig. 7 . Moreover, in conventional automotive suspension systems, spring constant has small variation with time. A similar study was made for the P E / X ¨ 1 transmissibility, and Fig. 8 shows simulated transmissibility between wheel acceleration and extension chamber pressure for different condition shock absorbers. The model was also validated for the displacement-force and velocity–force diagrams (not shown) usually employed on shock absorber characterization. From the above analysis, two methods were chosen and validated to assess shock absorber condition: computing the transmissibility between the sprung and unsprung masses accelerations and computing the transmissibility between the wheel acceleration and the shock absorber pressure in the extension chamber. 3 Experimental results To validate the above methods and to verify the feasibility of the in-vehicle shock absorber analysis in a multi-road excitation scenario, several experiments were conducted. Essays were conducted using several shock absorbers in different known conditions, with three different vehicles, a 1995 VW Polo, a 1996 FIAT Punto and a 1999 VW Sharan. The vehicles were driven on a 36Km tour of differentiated road profiles, from very bad condition roads to city roads and highways. A KONI dual-tube adjustable shock absorber was modified to measure both compression and extension chambers pressures and oil temperature. This shock absorber was subsequently tested in a dynamometer and in the VW Sharan rear axle. The installation of the instrumented shock absorber is depicted in Fig. 9 . Data was acquired using a NI USB6009 data acquisition board and signal conditioning electronics connected to a laptop running LabView. Two 0265 005 303 (Bosch, Germany) pressure sensors were used to measure internal chambers pressure, and a NTC M12 (Bosch, Germany) temperature sensor was used to measure internal oil temperature. The acceleration was measured with ADXL78 (Analog Devices, USA) accelerometers. To verify the proposed shock absorber model, the modified shock absorber was run in a dynamometer. Fig. 10 shows measured and simulated extension and compression chambers internal pressures for a sinusoidal 1.8 Hz input, revealing a good correspondence between the model and the shock absorber behavior. The pressure peak in extension chamber is higher than the pressure peak in compression chamber, and, in the compression stroke, pressures in both chambers are almost equal due to the small restriction of the compression-to-extension valve. 3.1 Road test results Fig. 11 shows the results of the average verified X ¨ 2 / X ¨ 1 transmissibility for four different damper status, showing that this parameter is a good indicator of the damping condition, more evident in the 10–15 Hz range, corresponding to the unsprung mass resonance frequency of the test vehicle. Results showed that this method can be used to detect shock absorber condition. Load influence was verified, and proved to be notorious, Fig. 12 , especially when dampers are in good condition, showing that load effect must be taken into account in order to avoid false results. The calculation of the transmissibility between road acceleration and extension chamber pressure gave very fine results (Fig. 13 ), where, as expected, transmissibility diminishes with damping condition deterioration. It also showed good independence with sprung mass variation, Fig. 14 , and independence with tire pressure, as shown in Fig. 15 . A key parameter that must be measured is temperature, as it determines oil volume and density, and subsequently the damping force. Fig. 16 shows the influence of temperature in shock absorber transmissibility between road acceleration and extension chamber pressure. As expected, results show shock absorber performance degradation with temperature, so an oil temperature sensor is mandatory to the accuracy of the methods. 4 Discussion The first proposed method proved to be a reliable way of determining shock absorber status. It is easily implemented, as no modification in the shock absorber construction or installation is required. One of the sensing modules may simply be installed attached to the shock absorber body, in order to measure unsprung mass acceleration and shock absorber temperature, while the other may be installed in the top mounting support of the shock absorber. In the case where there is already an accelerometer installed in the vehicle body, that data may be used to determine sprung mass acceleration, simplifying the installation procedure even more. However, synchronization during data acquisition is mandatory, and that may pose a problem to a system that is intended to be wireless, and with low power availability. Also, as verified, load effects must be taken into account, implying the use of a vehicle load sensor. However, in most cases, the sensor is already installed in the vehicle, being a part of the braking distribution system and/or being used to correct the headlamps alignment. The second proposed method is interesting as it gives accurate results, and enables just one measuring point (extension chamber pressure, wheel acceleration and temperature), making it more suitable to implementation through an embedded system. However, the installation of the measuring system requires modification in the shock absorber construction and assembly processes, as an access channel to the inner chamber pressure is required. 5 Conclusions and final remarks This paper describes part of the work that is being carried out to achieve a complete embedded smart shock absorber condition sensor system. Two methodologies were discussed and the results compared. Simulation and experimental results obtained with such measurement strategies were proven reliable and practicable to assess shock absorber condition under normal vehicle operation. Measurement systems for the physical quantities necessary to assess shock absorber condition can be easily developed and full implemented with MEMS devices built over standard CMOS technologies, reducing fabrication costs. A system to harvest available energy, e.g. in the form of mechanical vibration or temperature, thus making the device completely independent in terms of power supply, is currently being developed. A wireless solution can provide a very significant reduction of wiring in vehicles, with the advantage of cost reduction and weight, allowing even an increase of reliability and reduction of assistance needed during maintenance. An embedded sensor system capable of performing the presented methodologies will be a remarkable vehicle electronic feature, as it can clearly inform the driver when is necessary to replace shock absorbers. Such a self powered wireless sensing device will have the lifetime expectancy of the vehicle, becoming a maintenance free device. To our best knowledge, this is the first time (patent pending) that such a system is proposed. This shock absorber monitoring device will be a breakthrough in vehicle comfort, drivability and overall safety. References [1] J.C. Dixon The Shock Absorber Handbook 1999 SAE Warrendale [2] D.

Keywords: Shock absorber; Embedded system; Smart sensor; Vehicle safety 1. Introduction Shock absorbers, key components in a vehicle suspension system, play an important role in braking performance, maneuvering stability and onboard comfort. However, as any other mechanical system, suspension components are subjected to gradual wear, and shock absorbers in particular due to its physical working concept are more prone to deteriorate with time, distance driven and working conditions, resulting in excessive vehicle oscillations as a response to road disturbances, instability and increased breaking distances. Common diagnoses on ground suspension platforms give inaccurate results regarding the shock absorber condition [1,2]. More precise testing can be performed on a dedicated dynamometer, where a shock absorber velocity-force diagram can be collected [1,3]. Because shock absorbers must be removed from the vehicle in order to be tested, these analyses are seldom used. Insufficient examinations and because dampers are difficult to visually inspect are reasons why it is likely to have more vehicles with defective shock absorbers than worn tyres [4]. To address this issue, a monitoring system concept and an assessment method capable of continuously monitoring shock absorbers condition has been proposed in previous work [5,6]. The assessment method resulted * Corresponding author. Tel.: +351-244-820-300; fax: +351-244-820-310. E-mail address: ferreira@estg.ipleiria.pt.

The obtained suspension/shock absorber model was used to confirm the possibility of determining shock absorber condition by knowing wheel acceleration and shock absorber internal pressure (preferentially in the extension chamber). Trials done with shock absorbers, instrumented with macro sensors, under various known conditions validated the application of the proposed method [7]. Oil temperature is a key parameter, since it determines oil volume and density, and subsequently the damping force, making the temperature sensor needed for improved accuracy. As all necessary physical quantities are available jointly in the shock absorber housing, this solution enables single point measurements which means a monolithic sensor is desirable. The added functionality to the vehicle diagnosis system of such a sensor system will make it possible to alert the driver when dampers replacement is required.

Proposed monolithic sensor Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) where mechanical sensing elements are integrated in the silicon substrate have the ability to measure acceleration, pressure, and temperature, which makes them suitable to meet the application requirements. The fabrication technologies, allowing batch fabrication of systems with small dimensions, high sensitivity, a high degree of manufacturability and reduced cost per unit are key factors for the success of MEMS in other and similar application such as automotive tyre pressure sensors. The proposed micro-sensor has been fabricated in the SensoNor Multi-Project Wafer process (MultiMEMS) which was chosen because of its reliability, low cost and proven results in other applications. The MultiMEMS process is a bulk micromachining process with membranes of two thicknesses (3.1 Âµm and 23.1 Âµm) and a 10 Âµm frontside recess etch which can be used to etch through the thin membrane areas. Two types of piezoresistors are available for sensing: surface resistors for high sensitivity application and buried resistors for long term stability. Forming a triple stack of glass-silicon-glass, anodic bonding allows sealed cavities and pressure inlets. 2.1. Accelerometer A dual beam and dual mass accelerometer design was chosen to reduce the cross axis sensitivity from accelerations in plane with the silicon wafer (longitudinal and transversal to the beams length). Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of the accelerometer structure with an inset showing the geometry used for the beams. The structures dimensions were obtained from a finite elements analysis and mainly came as a function of the sensing piezoresistors length (which forged the minimal width of the beams), process standard release etch depth (which forged the thickness of the beams) and the maximum stress allowed from the process specifications. Proof masses are made of the 23.1 Âµm thickness region. While the maximum stress is located at the base of a beam with constant width and thickness, the given process results in a soft transition region between the thick (23.1 Âµm) and thin (3.1 Âµm) regions. The beams varying thickness resulted, for the presented design, in a stress peak 35 Âµm away from the beam base. To increase sensitivity the beams were strategically tapered to increase the extent of the high stress region in which the piezoresistors were positioned. The resulting stress profile, depicted in Fig. 2, is a smooth and larger high stress zone with more room to place the piezoresistors. And, for improved reproducibility, the location of maximum stress becomes geometrically forged by the mask alignment (tapered section). C. Ferreira et al. / Procedia Chemistry 1 (2009) 88â€“ 91 89 Fig. 1. Dual mass accelerometer with detail of the optimized beam geometry. Fig. 2. Equivalent stress on the accelerometer beams surface, comparison between rectangular and optimized beam shapes. 2.2. Pressure and temperature sensors To measure pressure, both simple flat membranes and bossed diaphragms designs were considered and studied. Bossed designs have improved linearity and even if theoretically designs with a membrane of 23.1 Âµm deep and central mass with wafer thickness deep (400 Âµm) are possible for the wanted pressure range, the necessary compensating structures for convex corners [8] have dimensions that exceed, by far, the required length for the membrane aperture mask, and therefore are impracticable. Also, as the tolerances of the back etch in the definition of the membrane dimension are quite big considering the needed membrane length, this could result in a membrane out of specifications with the consequent misalignment of the sensing elements. Therefore, a simple square 23.1 Âµm thickness membrane design with just concave corners was chosen. Structural analysis was done to define the membrane area as function of the material properties, working load range and maximum stress allowed. As shown in Fig. 3, the equivalent stress over a membrane surface is maximum at its center, while the sensitivity, function of the difference between longitudinal and transversal stresses, is maximum at the membrane edges (Fig. 4). For that reason, piezoresistors should be placed at membrane edges, although care should be taken with the process tolerances for the membrane dimension. For improved sensitivity, piezoresistors transversal to the membrane edge were divided in two to maximize its exposure to the high stress area. The use of full Wheatstone bridges maximizes sensitivity while reducing the sensitivity to temperature. Fig. 3. Equivalent stress over the membrane top surface. Fig. 4. Equivalent and |X-Y| stress profiles over the membrane surface. Temperature is measured with buried resistors, because they have a higher temperature coefficient than surface resistors. Two buried resistors are used, placed strategically near the pressure port, one with a terminal grounded and the other as a terminal connected to the sensor power supply pad. This configuration enhances the device temperature sensitivity while minimizing the number of output pads required (when both sensing resistors are used together with two external fixed resistors in a full Wheatstone bridge configuration).

The developed accelerometer was characterized using a BrÃ¼el & KjÃ¦r vibration exciter type 4809 and a Silicon Designs, Inc. analog accelerometer model 1210 for reference. A chirp vibrating waveform up to 35 Hz was applied to both accelerometers and data acquired with a NI USB6009 acquisition board and signal amplifying/conditioning electronics connected to a laptop running LabView. Results obtained for sensitivity without output amplification, shown in Fig. 6, are close to the maximum theoretical value of 84 ÂµV/V/g. Fig. 5.

Conclusion This paper describes a monolithic silicon sensor concept, fabricated using the SensoNor MultiMEMS process, capable of measuring shock absorber acceleration, internal pressure and temperature. Preliminary characterization results confirmed the accelerometer sensitivity, validating the structural study and reliability of optimized geometries. The integration of such a monitoring system in the shock absorbers allows near real time assessment of its condition and performance and will represent a major improvement to vehicle safety.

The developed accelerometer was characterized using a BrÃ¼el & KjÃ¦r vibration exciter type 4809 and a Silicon Designs, Inc. analog accelerometer model 1210 for reference. A chirp vibrating waveform up to 35 Hz was applied to both accelerometers and data acquired with a NI USB6009 acquisition board and signal amplifying/conditioning electronics connected to a laptop running LabView. Results obtained for sensitivity without output amplification, shown in Fig. 6, are close to the maximum theoretical value of 84 ÂµV/V/g. Fig. 5.

The monolithic sensor, measures the oil temperature, acceleration and internal pressure of the shock absorber. A dual mass accelerometer with optimized beam geometry is used for acceleration readout. In addition, a 23.1 μm thickness square membrane and two buried resistors are used for pressure and temperature sensing respectively. The proposed miniaturized sensor can be effectively integrated with standard single- and dual-tube shock absorbers. The data acquired during normal vehicle operation can be continuously used to monitor the condition of the shock absorbers, allowing shock absorbers to be replaced before their degradation significantly reduce the comfort, performance and safety of the vehicle.

Introduction The future of Artificial Insemination (AI) continues to be promising due to economic profits in herd practice. AI is the low cost option to disseminate the most profitable species. The reproductive efficiency is mentioned to be the major factor that affects production and economic efficiency. In herds that use AI, heat detection remains a serious problem limiting AI success [1]. Most detection methods arenâ€™t reliable or are expensive and not suitable in herd practice. Detection method should combine robustness, cost and herd feasibility. These characteristics suggests the need of continuous surveillance and excuse human intervention. To address these issues, the detection device or system must be based on measurement of animal physiologic parameters that depend systematically on estrus cycle [2]. Also, it should be remote and self-powered. Hormonal variations during estrus cycle produces variations not only in animal behavior, but also, in physiologic parameters such as reproductive tissues hydration and body temperature. Both different consequences are systematic and reflect the estrus phase. However, animal behavior is also a consequence of many other factors. As a result, heat detection technique based on animal behavior can produce both false positives and false negatives. In contrast, tissue hydration variations and temperature surrounding reproductive organs can provide useful data to detect heat phase and as a consequence, to predict the AI pinpoint time. Preceding studies revels systematic electric conductivity variations on bovine vulvar fluids during estrus cycle[3]. 1876-6196/09 Â©2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. doi:10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.126 Procedia Chemistry 1 (2009) 505 508 Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license. Another detection method is based in this characteristic and is performed by inserting a probe on animal genitals. However, impedance variations from animal to animal, disease spreading or anatomic damage risk, and required labor discourage this method[4]. A autonomous implantable bioimpedance and temperature monitor can overcome most problems associated to the reliable detection of estrus [5]. A concept study of a novel estrus detection method based on bioimpedance and body temperature was already published. Both bipolar and tetrapolar measurement method could be used to perform bioimpedance monitoring. First method is simpler to implement and needs only two electrodes, instead of the four needed for the second one[6]. Except to low frequency bioimpedance measurements, where the capacitive electrode-tissue interface is significant, bipolar method can provide similar accuracy as the tetrapolar one if correct circuitry are applied. Total capsule size and power consumption led us to choose the bipolar method. This paper describes a impedance and temperature measurement device designed to evaluate both parameters during cattle animal estrus cycle. The purpose of this device is to evaluate the magnitude of bioimpedance and its variations during estrus cycle detecting its minimum value. Acquired data will allow the optimization of a bioimplantable low-power micro-system design regarding the analog front-end that includes the current source and signal conditioning circuits. Experiments are also described and some results from in-vivo evaluation on a sheep are presented. The on-going design of the implantable micro-system are also presented. 2. Material and methods Measurement setup device is composed by an implantable capsule and measuring device connected by cable. Implantable capsule has two stainless steel ring shape electrodes distanced 8mm and a PT100 temperature transducer. Capsule volume was filled with biocompatible polyurethane and its cylindrical shape with semi- spherical bases was carefully designed for animal implantation. Fig. 1. Measurement setup block diagram. The experimental macro device is composed by an impedance converter AD5933 (Analog Devices, USA), a analog conditioning circuit, two microcontrollers and a flash memory card. The device core is the impedance converter. It generates a sinusoidal voltage output to be applied on the living tissue and acquires 256 samples from the analog resultant current. An internal DSP computes the DFT of the current samples and, and the harmonic 0 corresponds to the complex impedance factor. In this system, impedance converter performs both bioimpedance and temperature measurements. The analog conditioning circuit reduces the AC amplitude voltage and cancel the DC voltage from the impedance converter output to avoid tissue polarization allowing long term bio-impedance monitoring. Temperature measurements are accomplished by using an embedded PT100 resistive traducer, thermally connected to one electrode. In order to use the same impedance converter and circuitry, an analog multiplexer is used allowing high resolution temperature measurement inherent to the impedance converter. The main microcontroller implements a real-time clock to periodically activate the impedance converter. It also processes the measured data and transmit it to the flash card module using its asynchronous serial port.

Miranda et al. / Procedia Chemistry 1 (2009) 505â€“508 506 The purpose of the second microcontroller is to implement a FAT driver to store data in the flash memory card conveniently in a text or csv file for posterior analysis. Several measurement parameters are configurable such as the output voltage amplitude, sweep frequency points and interval period between measurements. Also, each frequency sweep point can be repeated and the cumulative result is used to improve precision. System enters in sleep mode between measurements. Analog circuitry and memory card module are completely shutted down and total current consumption in sleep mode is 48 A. Measurement consumption is about 30mA during 15s. A lithium CR2 battery can last almost tree months performing 96 impedance conversions each twenty minutes. Acquired data stored in the flash memory card is converted to impedance and temperature values though a spreadsheet file. This method allow the use of any resistive temperature transducer and turns the calibration process and data post process more flexible. 3. Experiment and Results Experiments consists in continuous local bioimpedance and body temperature monitoring of herd sheep and cow females. Measurement region chosen was the vulvar muscle, were the reproductive hormones produce major effect and were the measurement capsule can be easily implanted with fast tissue regeneration and no permanent consequences. The capsule implantation surgical protocol used was an adaptation of the surgical procedures described by Feldman et al. [7] and Smith et al.[8] in sheeps. A two centimeter vertical skin incision was made midway between the dorsal and ventral commissures of the vulva and the subcutaneous tissue dissected gently cranially five to six centimeter to position the capsule beneath the vaginal mucosa. The device was maintained in place by a subcutaneous suture that fixed the end of the implantable capsule, near the exit of the cable that connect the capsule to the measurement device. Figure 2(a) shows a final measurement device implementation including the implantable capsule. Figure 2(b) shows the device installation on a sheep to perform the experiment. Fig. 2. (a) Measurement device picture and implantable capsule; (b) Measurement device installed on a sheep. In the first experiment, temperature and bioimpedance frequency sweep were sampled each twenty minutes during two entire estrus cycle on a sheep. From each measurement, temperature and bioimpedance at tree frequency was featured and correspondent diary mean values are presented in figure 3. Bioimpedance data shows two local minimums which corresponds to an entire estrus cycle from June 29 to July 16. Fig. 3.

According to the single cell tissue equivalent circuit model, impedance profiles suggest the extracellular resistance variations are responsible for the observed variations. The intracellular resistance lower global impedance mean and its variations for high frequencies due to the capacitive characteristic associated to the cell membrane. 4. On-going and future work Physiologic parameters dependent on estrus cycle are now being monitored on cows. Each thirty minutes body temperature and bioimpedance sweep are sampled and stored in a flash memory card using the same experimental macro device. The implantable micro-system are being designed and simulated in a 0.35 m standard CMOS technology. A proposed block diagram is presented in the figure 4. Fig. 4. Block diagram of the proposed implantable micro-system. Low-power and low-voltage block architectures and design techniques are applied to the current source and to the analog front-end. Most transistors are polarized in moderate inversion to reduce current and keep the required transcondutance and bandwidth. Temperature measurement are performed using a proportional to absolute temperature output voltage circuitry, and its signal is multiplexed with the resultant voltage from bioimpedance to be measured. A second-order Sigma-Delta modulator processes the analog signals to digital data to be transmitted through a efficient radio-frequency unit. References 1. R.

Our approach is based on a distributed cooperative network, tailored to meet the specific needs of viticulture enterprises which also explore tourism as a valuable national and international business source. Instead of focusing on operational issues, such as remote sensing and data transmission, among others, we present the Inov@Douro model from the knowledge generation point-of-view, intended to support the multidisciplinary concept of a cooperation approach among regional partners. As a result, this collaborative approach might be the most suited technological tool to promote precision agriculture sustainability practices based on a symbiotic cooperation with the tourism sector. The Inov@Douro model aims to represent a new working style for this unique region, where the concept of public and private information is a key feature to achieve the desired success as a knowledge network. As a guideline to attain the implementation of such a model, information technology and infrastructures tools are discussed in order to promote precision agriculture practices while giving valuable and dynamic tourist information to the general public.",

In this paper we improve the performance of MMP for smooth images by employing a more flexible block segmentation scheme than the one defined in the original algorithm. The new partition scheme allows MMP to exploit the image's structure in a much more adaptive and effective way. Experimental tests have shown consistent performance gains, mainly for smooth images. When employing the new block segmentation scheme, MMP outperforms the state-of-the-art JPEG2000 and H.264/AVC Intra-frame image coding algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth images, at low to medium compression ratios. © 2008 IEEE.",

The objective of this project is the development of a new image application, based on the Multidimensional Multiscale Parser algorithm (MMP), for compression of scanned documents, composed by pictures, graphs and text. MMP is a generic compression algorithm that has been successfully applied in image coding. The use of a multiscale adaptive pattern matching coding paradigm allows it to achieve good results, consistently, for both smooth and text images. On the contrary, the traditional transform-based methods have a well known performance deficit for non-smooth image coding. Current state-of-the-art compound image coding schemes rely on the use of segmentation techniques to split foreground and background planes of an input image. The performance of such methods, generally, degrades with the loss of efficiency of the segmentation process, namely for complex documents or low quality scans. These losses result from the use of transform-based compression for the background layer, like in DjVu or JPEG2000/Part6. The flexibility of MMP algorithm makes it efficiency independent of the segmentation process. Our experimental results show that MMP already outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms, thus proving its usefulness as a compound image encoding algorithm. In this paper we present the current results and the developed coding schemes, as well as an overview on the future work for this project.",

        "doc_abstract": "This paper is part of a long-term effort to introduce precision viticulture in the region of Demarcated Region of Douro. It presents the architecture, hardware and software of a platform designed for that purpose, called MPWiNodeZ. A major feature of this platform is its power-management subsystem, able to recharge batteries with energy harvested from the surrounding environment from up to three sources. It allows the system to sustain operation as a general-purpose wireless acquisition device for remote sensing in large coverage areas, where the power to run the devices is always a concern. The MPWiNodeZ, as a ZigBee™ network element, provides a mesh-type array of acquisition devices ready for deployment in vineyards. In addition to describing the overall architecture, hardware and software of the monitoring system, the paper also reports on the performance of the module in the field, emphasising the energy issues, crucial to obtain self-sustained operation. The testing was done in two stages: the first in the laboratory, to validate the power management and networking solutions under particularly severe conditions, the second stage in a vineyard. The measurements about the behaviour of the system confirm that the hardware and software solutions proposed do indeed lead to good performance. The platform is currently being used as a simple and compact yet powerful building block for generic remote sensing applications, with characteristics that are well suited to precision viticulture in the DRD region. It is planned to be used as a network of wireless sensors on the canopy of vines, to assist in the development of grapevine powdery mildew prediction models. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It presents the architecture, hardware and software of a platform designed for that purpose, called MPWiNodeZ. A major feature of this platform is its power-management subsystem, able to recharge batteries with energy harvested from the surrounding environment from up to three sources. It allows the system to sustain operation as a general-purpose wireless acquisition device for remote sensing in large coverage areas, where the power to run the devices is always a concern. The MPWiNodeZ, as a ZigBee™ network element, provides a mesh-type array of acquisition devices ready for deployment in vineyards. In addition to describing the overall architecture, hardware and software of the monitoring system, the paper also reports on the performance of the module in the field, emphasising the energy issues, crucial to obtain self-sustained operation. The testing was done in two stages: the first in the laboratory, to validate the power management and networking solutions under particularly severe conditions, the second stage in a vineyard. The measurements about the behaviour of the system confirm that the hardware and software solutions proposed do indeed lead to good performance. The platform is currently being used as a simple and compact yet powerful building block for generic remote sensing applications, with characteristics that are well suited to precision viticulture in the DRD region. It is planned to be used as a network of wireless sensors on the canopy of vines, to assist in the development of grapevine powdery mildew prediction models. Keywords ZigBee Wireless sensor network Viticulture Acquisition device Remote sensing Energy harvesting 1 Introduction Precision agriculture (PA) and precision viticulture (PV) are production systems that promote variable management practices within a field according to site conditions. The concept is based on new tools and information sources provided by modern technologies, such as yield monitoring devices, soil, plant and pest sensors and remote sensing. Despite the benefits, such diversity is currently restraining the rate of adoption of these technological tools, which varies considerably from country to country, and from region to region (Seelan et al., 2003). The Demarcated Region of Douro (DRD) (a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the oldest Wine Demarcated Region of the World), due to its unique characteristics, poses very specific challenges, mainly due to the topographic profile, pronounced climatic variations and complex soil characteristics. Grape harvest and disease predictions as well as the assessment of the grape value are currently left to the grape growers, without the help of decision-support mechanisms, in an environment where no significant irrigation systems exists. In order to improve the quantity and quality of winegrowers’ products, an array of sensors that monitors the environmental, climatic and physiological parameters is needed. The on-going technological developments in the miniaturization of electronic devices and wireless communication technology have led to the emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The power necessary to effectively run the related circuitry is currently being scaled down, with the help of energy harvested from the environment where the devices are deployed. Strictly speaking, WSN are arrays of electronic devices with sensing capabilities that are interconnected using a radio network. Many architectures exist, ranging from micro-devices with embedded smart sensors to complete self-powered acquisition devices that support a large variety of external sensors (Morais et al., 1996; Gomide et al., 2001; Beckwith et al., 2004; Delin et al., 2005; Hart and Martinez, 2006). Regarding network support, many protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee and proprietary forms of radio network interconnections exist (Lee et al., 2002; Beckwith et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006). There are several key issues to address when selecting a suitable technology for wireless data transfer. One of the most important criteria is the network support, usually determined by the application target, which limits the available offer. Other key factors include data transfer rates and power consumption. Many stand-alone radio-frequency transceivers are suited for cable replacement (point-to-point connections), often using proprietary protocols to enhance data transfer reliability. However, in these RF devices, mesh-type networks are usually not supported due to the complexity of the software implementation. The well known IEEE 802.11 family of standards is able to handle very high data rates, which however imply power-demanding devices. The IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) standard, although capable of supporting a Personal Area Network (PAN), is primarily intended for cable replacement solutions. It does have the capability to form small star-type networks known as piconets and scatternets. Within these networks, a master device performs synchronisation between all connected slaves, rendering high data rates and continuous data transfers possible. Although interesting to deal with a limited number of nodes, it has not been widely adopted for the deployment of large arrays of sensing devices in crops, mainly due to power demands and restrictions on the number of nodes and connections. In contrast, the ZigBee environment has been specifically developed to address the demands of sensor networks, including the need to handle a large number of nodes. ZigBee builds upon the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE, 2003), enabling the creation of complex ad hoc networks with up to 65536 devices, suitable for industrial, agricultural, vehicular, residential and medical environments. The intent of IEEE 802.15.4 is to provide ultra low power consumption and very short wake-up times capabilities at very low cost to devices operating in a Low Rate (250kbps) Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). To this effect, the IEEE 802.15.4 assumes that the data transmitted are short and that transmissions occur at a low-duty cycle (active/sleep times ratio), reducing the overall power needs and enabling the application of battery–powered embedded systems. The ZigBee standard defines the network layer specification to allow the formation of three network topologies: star, tree and peer-to-peer. In the latter topology, also known as mesh-type, every network element can communicate with any other within its range. This allows more complex network formations to be implemented, such as ad hoc and self-configuring networks. These should contain a unique coordinator, responsible for managing all the PAN functionalities and, for instance, retrieving all relevant data from the ZigBee network. This mesh-type topology, which relies on the routing mechanisms for multi-hop provided by the network layer, is a key element for wireless networks of smart acquisition devices in the field. ZigBee also defines the type of device based on the set of functions that is enabled to perform. The Full-Function Device (FFD) can act as a router while the Reduced-Function Device (RFD) is usually an end-device that is only allowed to communicate with its router or coordinator. In addition, ZigBee also provides a framework for application programming in the application layer. More details on ZigBee/802.15.14 networks can be found in the survey (Baronti et al., 2007) and in (IEEE, 2003). Currently, ZigBee is a promising solution to enhance the development of ad hoc multi-hop sensor networks, and a lot of research effort is being invested in adopting and finding new solutions for almost every kind of monitoring purpose (Jinsheng et al., 2006). However, agricultural production systems suffer from the usual delay in the application of these highly innovative technologies. Among the several aspects that constrain these developments we mention the issues related to power management and availability, and the ease with which the systems can be deployed in an open field. This paper addresses some of these challenges and describes a ZigBee multi-powered wireless acquisition device, designed to be part of the remote sensing project of introducing PV in the Demarcated Region of Douro. The system represents an evolution over the SPWAS (Morais et al., 1996) acquisition station, contributing to make highly flexible acquisition systems available for application in PV and remote sensing. Its features include the ability to harvest energy from the environment, in multiple ways. It also contains a software-based method that prevents automatically switched-off nodes from being switched-on soon after, as their batteries charge again. Such cycles have a negative impact on the battery life, and are more difficult and expensive to avoid via hardware. The need to deal with network discovery/connectivity failures and avoid repetitive and wasteful connection attempts is also addressed. The paper describes the overall architecture of this monitoring system (Section 2), then the hardware (Section 3) and software (Section 4) of the basic module around which the system is built, and then reports on the performance of the module in the field, emphasising the energy issues, which are crucial to obtain self-sustained operation. This is the main experimental part of the paper (Section 5), and the results obtained confirm that the hardware and software solutions proposed in the paper do indeed lead to good performance. The conclusions and lessons that were learned in the process are discussed in detail in Section 6, which closes the paper. 2 Remote sensing wireless network for precision viticulture The layout of hillside vineyards in the DRD is strongly conditioned by the original slope and relief of the parcels of vines. Also, the soil is mainly based on complex schist which imposes some constrains in the assessment of its hydrological aspects. The unique characteristics of these vineyards, as well as the topographic aspects, erosion control, vertical planting, the intrinsic limited water availability, and wide temperature span across all day and year, demand the most recent technological tools, such as distributed monitoring and information processing. These may help in understanding vineyard variability and therefore how it might be managed, thus improving the quantity and quality of the wines. A good example of using WSN as a key tool to understand productivity variability can be found in Camilli et al. (2007). As an increasing number of electronic devices with various types of sensors are embedded in agricultural processes, efficient system integration has become a critical goal. The huge amount of data retrieved by intensive field data acquisition needs to be centralized and made available on the web, by using for instance geographical information systems (GIS). On a regional, or even at a global scale, large plantation infrastructures are the result of the interconnection of multiple local plantations, which is the DRD dominant scenario regarding vineyards. Such a distributed platform, which incorporates information from remote sensing, from in situ weather conditions, from water source levels, from soil history, and from farmer knowledge about the relative productivity of selected “Management Zones” of the vineyard, can be applied, for instance, to predict yield and diseases, and to disseminate advice throughout the growing season about the optimum usage of water and the chemical treatments needed. To address the relevant issues regarding the deployment of such a monitoring network in the DRD with its specificities, we propose a remote sensing network architecture, depicted in a simplified way in Fig. 1 . The MPWiNodeZ, as a self-sustaining smart acquisition device, aims to enhance in-field data gathering and to give network support to systems such as those described in (Valente et al., 2006). For each vineyard management zone (VMZ), a ZigBee network of MPWiNodeZ devices can be deployed to acquire data on soil moisture content, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation, among other parameters. The cluster head (CH) operates as a local (or VMZ) sink node for this wireless sensor network. This creates an intermediate level of aggregation nodes that manages the sensor networks and performs local data integration and supervision functions, while maintaining connectivity through the whole region. Since each wine making company may have vineyards located in any location of the DRD, the connectivity between each VMZ and the company office headquarters (shippers’ office in Fig. 1) represents an important issue that must be addressed. To this effect, the clusters are wirelessly linked to the shippers’ office through a TCP/IP-based connection such as GPRS and 802.11 links. To accommodate the disparate data sources from vineyards and its surrounding environment, each acquisition device should also have a high degree of flexibility concerning the types of sensors allowed. To accomplish this goal, the common signal conditioning procedures of acquiring voltage-, current-, frequency- and resistance-output sensors have been complemented with a small set of IEEE 1451 standards to include information about each sensor in a Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS). Each acquisition device has the necessary computing power to verify and validate its own data and convert them to international units, thus reducing the amount of processing at the aggregation node that could have hundreds of devices connected. Fig. 2 illustrates the application of a ZigBee network to enhance remote sensing in a PV environment. For simplicity, only one parameter is shown for each network element. In the case of the MPWiNodeZ device, up to nine parameters can be measured. The experimental results reported in this paper show that the power management and networking solutions adopted do work in practice, both in the laboratory and in the field. The MPWiNodeZ devices will be used to deploy a network of wireless sensors on the canopy of vines, which will be used as a tool to develop models to predict the development of grapevine powdery mildew. 3 The MPWiNodeZ acquisition device In order to better understand various issues in deploying a wireless sensor network in remote sensing of environmental parameters, we have developed a prototype system that satisfies the requirements for self-sustaining network nodes in agricultural environments. The MPWiNodeZ (Multi-Powered Wireless Node ZigBee) device is a small custom board aimed to act as a router or as an end-device in ZigBee networks. It is based on the MPWiNodeX, a generic power-management platform that enables self-sustaining devices. A similar device, denoted MPWiNodeS, based on an off-the-shelf RF transceiver (RC1280 from Radiocrafts, Norway), has also been developed and tested to enable simple star-type networks on a proprietary environment with the main purpose of evaluating and characterizing the power-management platform. The MPWiNodeZ can manage up to three simultaneously energy sources to charge a compact pack of three 1/2 AA-size 650mAh NiMH batteries. The MPWiNodeZ is built around two varieties of waterproof encapsulations to support the harsh environment that an open field presents to any electronic device. The power-management hardware and software systems were carefully designed to withstand the operating conditions. To achieve maximum flexibility, the system recharges its batteries using energy harvested from the surrounding environment, from up to three sources (photonic energy, kinetic energy from moving water in irrigation pipes and from wind), avoiding maintenance and human interference. The MPWiNodeZ device combines these energy harvesting methods with a power-conservative software application that avoids the repetitive use of the available radio channels when joining an existent network, thus extending battery autonomy. The embedded software application is ready for the implementation of the IEEE 1451 object model to achieve a higher degree of sensor interoperability. The core of the MPWiNodeZ is a wireless μ-controller (JN5121 from Jennic, UK) that comprises an 802.15.4 RF transceiver and the ZigBee stack. Besides the embedded communications capabilities, this platform has also been chosen to provide reliable signal conditioning to raw sensors and subsequent data processing. To this effect, it is intended to employ a scaled-down version of the IEEE 1451.1 object model for smart sensors, thus promoting a well-defined communication protocol for high-level sensor-to-network interaction. 3.1 Hardware overview The MPWiNodeZ device offers a rich and flexible set of functions that enables a wide range of sensors to be plugged in, regardless of its computation and communication capabilities with minimal power consumption. By employing the IEEE 1451.1 object model, the MPWiNodeZ device can use this standardized procedure to convert raw data from low-cost analog sensors into meaningful information. The same approach has also been followed in Oostdyk et al. (2006) and Ding et al. (2007), where the implementation of the IEEE 1451 has been simplified to a high-level communication between two ZigBee devices (the coordinator and the MPWiNodeZ), each one acting as a Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP). The JN5121 wireless μ-controller has been chosen as a cost-effective solution. This highly integrated device integrates a 32-bit RISC processor, with a fully compliant 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver, 64kb of ROM, 96kb of RAM, and incorporates a wide range of digital and analogue peripherals. With a low sleep current (below 5μA), the JN5121 provides a versatile solution for wireless sensor networking applications. The block diagram of the MPWiNodeZ device is depicted in Fig. 3 . Besides the μ-controller, it comprises an external 12-bit, A/D converter (AD7888 from Analog Devices, MA, USA). The AD7888 is a micro-power (3μW in power-down mode) ADC with serial interface that operates from a single 2.7V power supply. It contains eight single-ended analog inputs and features an on-chip 2.5V precision reference that may be used (software selectable) for the voltage reference for A/D conversion instead of using the supply voltage. The power-management block is responsible for charging the system battery-pack and additionally it provides data on energy harvested from environment. External sensors are powered by a separate DC–DC converter (MAX710 from Maxim, CA, USA) that converts the battery voltage into a regulated 5V or 3.3V output, pin selectable. This converter is turned on only when needed, otherwise it remains in the shutdown mode. A photograph of the MPWiNodeZ device can be seen in Fig. 4 . 3.2 Energy harvesting and power management When considering an array of sensing devices that are deployed across an extensive agricultural area, the energy supply system is a crucial issue. The traditional, yet most used approach is to use batteries, rechargeable or not. However, these energy reservoirs can store a finite amount of energy, and their replacement and maintenance represents a severe bottleneck. An emerging technique that circumvents this limitation is environmental energy harvesting that exploits energy sources that are ubiquitous to the operating space (Raghunathan et al., 2006). In the present application target, and regarding availability, the most feasible harvesting techniques are related to solar and kinetic energy sources. The power requirements of the MPWiNodeZ device are mostly satisfied by a low-voltage 0.5W solar panel (MSX005 from Solarex, MD, USA), which is used to efficiently charge a compact 3.6V 650mAh NiMH battery-pack. With only this energy source and reservoir, the MPWiNodeZ would operate indefinitely, due to its low-duty cycle operation as a ZigBee end-device. However, this turns out to be insufficient to permanently run a device operating as a network router. To this effect, supplementary kinetic energy is harvested from water and wind flow. In the first case, power is provided by a hydrogenerator placed in the irrigation pipes (which we regard as being similar to a power outlet in the field) and, in the second case, by a small wind-powered generator. Fig. 5 shows photographs of the energy harvesters that have been used. In addition to providing power, the associated harvesting techniques double as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed. Fig. 6 shows the simplified power-management block where, besides the main function of recharging the system battery, it also supplies data on the amount of solar radiation, wind speed and irrigation water flow as a density of pulses related with each parameter. Each pulse sequence is applied to a 4:1 precision multiplexer (MAX4618 from Maxim, CA, USA), which selects the signal to be filtered (by R1 and C1 in Fig. 7 ), in order to generate its mean value. Prior to analog-to-digital conversion, this DC value is amplified by a factor of two, using a fixed-gain operational amplifier (MAX4174 from Maxim, CA, USA). Due to its low power consumption, this amplifier is simply powered from a digital output of the μ-controller. In addition, and since each power-management output signals are open-drain, the other part of the 4:1 multiplexer is used to connect the appropriate pull-up resistor. By using this approach, based on the use of the same components for all inputs, the related measurement chain can be disconnected thus saving energy. 4 Software organization The MPWiNodeZ was built around the ZigBee standard, to give wireless networking capabilities to the acquisition devices. Monitoring needs, regarding the hypothetical sensing devices that may be attached as well as the sampling interval required for each of them, have dictated the implementation of a high-level application protocol. For instance, every attached sensor may have different operating rules that must be transferred, stored and applied by each MPWiNodeZ device. In addition, power-management issues should be addressed to avoid any kind of unpredicted behaviour, such as unreliable battery operation. 4.1 Operation mode The software was designed to meet the demands of battery-operated systems. One major concern is the possibility of system oscillations, or more precisely system on and off cycles, caused by partially charged batteries. The cycles are usually triggered by a battery voltage drop, a consequence of nearly drained batteries. The voltage drop leads to the system being turned off. The battery voltage then rises again, because the load is removed, and the system may be switched on again, and so on. The traditional approach to prevent this undesirable oscillating situation is to add some hysteresis to the power-management circuits. In the case of the MPWiNodeZ device, the solution was implemented in software, and completely avoids the oscillation problem. The application code (developed under the Jennic CodeBlocks environment) that was implemented in MPWiNodeZ device follows the generic state machine represented in Fig. 8 . After a power-on, the hardware is properly configured and left in a state of minimum current consumption, State 0. After this very first initialization stage, a sleep time T 1 is used before going to State 1. State 1 represents the idle state where the battery voltage level is monitored. Every T 2 s, the system wakes-up and samples the battery voltage level. If the battery level is higher than a predetermined value, the system goes to State 2 after the sleep time T 3, otherwise remains in State 1. After switching to State 1, which means that the battery has enough energy, the MPWiNodeZ device tries to discover a nearby router or coordinator for binding. If successful, it is assumed that the acquisition device has the sufficient conditions to operate normally and tries, after the short time T 4, to join the existing ZigBee network (State 3) in order to acquire and store the network parameters for later use. If discovery and joining conditions are not met, it returns to the idle state after the sleep time T 10. State 4 reflects the data acquisition and transmission tasks. The first time that the MPWiNodeZ device goes to this state (on the transition 3→4), it waits the fixed sleep time T 5. The sub-states 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 (separated by the time T 6) are responsible for setting the necessary timing tasks in the data acquisition process (sensors power-on time, capture period, etc.). At the end (sub-state 4.4), the 802.15.4 radio system of the μ-controller is powered on (T 7 interval) to send the acquired data using the saved network parameters. If an acknowledgement is received from the network layer (indicating that data has been transferred to the nearby router or coordinator), the MPWiNodeZ enters in sleep mode during the time T 9 that represents the time between data samples, user defined. In case of failure, it returns to State 1. Besides the above-mentioned, states 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 have additional conditions (dashed curves in Fig. 8), concerning battery voltage levels, that must be met. Whenever the battery voltage falls below a predetermined value, the MPWiNodeZ returns directly to the idle mode waiting for the battery to be operative. Table 1 shows these time intervals (used by default) and gives a short description for each one. 4.2 Functional rules and configuration One of the goals of the MPWiNodeZ device is to promote the on-board extraction of meaningful information about the raw sensors that can be connected. To this effect, and as a first step to adopt the IEEE 1451 family of standards concerning smart sensors, the 1451.0 definition of TEDS is used, mainly to convert raw data into metadata. As a result of this implementation, the MPWiNodeZ is able to perform some local processing tasks and return meaningful sensor data over the network such as the sensor value of the measured parameter in engineering units, rather than the unprocessed, raw result of an analog-to-digital conversion. The TEDS is an electronic data sheet in a standardized format stored in the μ-controller flash memory that describes each attached transducer through the Transducer Interface Module (TIM). Since the MPWiNodeZ has a total input capability of 9 channels (8 analog inputs and a digital counter input), each channel in the TIM must be described. For that purpose, a channel TEDS was developed. It contains information of each transducer such as the transducer type, range limits, physical units and timing restrictions. In this first step to adopt IEEE1451, each channel TEDS was stored in the μ-controller flash memory only during the programming process. If some transducer attached to some input channel is changed, a new programming procedure is needed. In the near future, we intend to upload each TEDS through the wireless network. Beside the characterization of each transducer, the behaviour of the entire MPWiNodeZ device should also be defined. In our implementation, it is defined by a set of functional rules. These rules occupies only four bytes (valid for MPWiNodeZ and MPWiNodeS devices), thus being suitable to upload through the ZigBee network. Table 2 shows the bit coding of these 4-byte rules, where a short description is also given. These 4-byte rules settings virtually define the full-operation mode of each networked MPWiNodeZ device. Besides the usual procedure of enabling each data acquisition channel sampling and time window between each sampling procedure, they also allow other important settings such as the definition of the transmit power level that may be used. When in automatic mode, each MPWiNodeZ device uses the Link Quality Indication (LQI) of the wireless μ-controller to adjust the transmitted power, thus optimizing energy usage during each data transfer. The identification of the sender also poses specific problems that must be addressed. When working with a mesh-type network topology, sender identification is not always possible (an example is when the sender is more than two hops from the coordinator). To overcome this issue, we have decided to transmit the sender identification along with sensor data. Fig. 9 shows the ZigBee protocol KVP (Key Value Pair) frame used in data transmission. Essentially, our ZigBee payload comprises the sender identification, the 4-byte device operating rules and data payload flowing between the MPWiNodeZ device and the network coordinator. This data payload field contains the data acquired from the attached sensors as well as the time stamp which will be discussed in the next section. 4.3 Time stamp Time synchronization is a common requirement for wireless sensor networks since it allows collective signal processing, sensor and source localization, data aggregation, and distributed sensing (Milenković et al., 2006). In some applications of wireless personal area networks, synchronized time stamps are critical for proper correlation of data coming from different sensors and for an efficient sharing of the communication channel. Time stamping is also important in the case of intermittent communication within multi-hop networks that can significantly postpone transmission of the sensors’ data. Remote sensing in precision agriculture is one example of a networking sensing application where real-time requirements are not strict. Due to the process inertia, most of the measurements are commonly taken with a time base of several minutes, which relaxes the algorithms that provide a time stamp for each data sample. Such time scales are appropriate for parameters such as air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and sap flow. For the planned sensing network applications of the MPWiNodeZ device, the time stamps do not require precision of seconds; 1min is a typical value. The time stamp is usually tagged to a data sample by the ZigBee coordinator every time that a data frame is received. However, a more flexible mechanism has been added in order to support acquisition devices that have an embedded Real-Time Clock (RTC). The general idea is to add a time stamp as soon as possible, at the origin of the data if at all possible. If the MPWiNodeZ device uses a low-power RTC (in our case DS1302 from Dallas Semiconductor, CA, USA), a valid time stamp data is immediately transmitted to the coordinator. If not, the time stamp is reset to 0, indicating that the next node must insert it. A network router with RTC hardware capabilities may have to insert all the time stamps if none of the nodes have the mechanism for doing so. Otherwise, the insertion of the time stamp is left to the network coordinator. Fig. 10 illustrates the described process where the seconds field in the time stamp is used for illustration purposes only. In this example, device A takes some measurements at Coordinator Time (CT) 15:43:28. Since device A does not have a RTC, it simply clears the time stamp field. Device C, which has a RTC, receives the data payload at CT 15:43:36, inserting that time in the time stamp field. Finally, the data reaches the coordinator at CT 15:43:40, which inserts the samples values in the internal database with the 15:43 time stamp. 5 Experimental results In order to properly evaluate the MPWiNodeZ device, a two-phase experimental methodology was used. It validates the power-management solutions during all active time periods (acquisition, processing, transmission and reception), and tests the operational issues regarding software implementation of the state machine under critical network conditions. The first phase took place in a controlled laboratorial environment, where a small ZigBee network was formed by using a coordinator (connected to a laptop through a RS232 link), two network routers (one hop away from the coordinator) and two MPWiNodeZ devices (as the one shown in Fig. 4) as end-devices, each connected to its router. The second experimental phase was performed under real operating conditions in a nearby vineyard. To this effect, an MPWiNodeZ was used to acquire air and soil temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation data, as depicted in Fig. 11 . To test the discovery and joining procedures of the ZigBee application framework, two routers (actually two MPWiNodeZ devices running the router application software) were used in between the MPWiNodeZ under test and the coordinator (located in the laboratory). The main goal of the first stage experiments was the validation of all software solutions, including the described state machine and the evaluation of the power-management platform in low-duty cycle operation modes and under critical situations, such as the power-up conditions after a battery charging cycle has been initiated. The handling of these situations usually requires a large amount of power that we needed to quantify and measure, especially when running network discovery/joining procedures. Because this first stage of the experimental setup exercises the system under particularly severe conditions, it provides important insight about the deployment of ZigBee-based systems running on batteries charged from energy harvested from the surrounding environment. In order to take proper and representative waveforms of battery voltage and current consumption profiles, this evaluation had to be performed in the laboratory. To best describe real operating conditions, several low-power analog sensors were used: three temperature sensors for measuring two air and one soil temperature (LM60B from National Semiconductor, CA, USA), one relative humidity sensor (HybridCap from Panametrics, USA) and two solar radiation sensors (TSL251 and TSL230 both from Texas Instruments, USA). The sampling rate of acquired data was kept randomly variable between 30s and 30min to create several battery discharging profiles. Fig. 12 shows the first cycle starting from the power-up condition (state 0) until the acknowledge has been received after a successful data transmission (state 5). The power supply current was measured by using a precision 6 1/2 digit multimeter (Keithley model 2000) with data logging capabilities connected to a computer. For this purpose, the maximum number of data points allowed (1000) was used. To fit this power consumption profile into a 1000-point window with sufficient resolution to also describe system operation throughout the entire cycle, the time periods between states were reduced, specifically T 1 = T 3 = T 5 =7s. As can be observed from Fig. 12, the total time between State 2 and the end of State 3 is approximately 2s (T 4), which represents the most power-demanding period. In fact, during this period the MPWiNodeZ device must search an available network and issue a joining request. In order to save a significant amount of battery energy, it is only allowed a one-shot joining process. If it fails, the system will resume T 10 + T 3 later, according to Fig. 8. After this stage, where the network parameters are acquired and saved for later use, the first acquisition task will be triggered T 5 later. For normal operation, the acquisition process will then be repeated every T 9 s. Under the application scope of the MPWiNodeZ device, T 9 may take values of the order of several minutes. With a reasonable value of 10min, probably even greater, a coarse average current consumption would be given by (1) 〈 i 〉 = I ′ T ′ + I 9 T 9 T ′ + T 9 where I′ corresponds to the average current of the active period (State 4.4→State 5). Considering T′≈ T 8 =2s, T 9 =600s, I′∼40mA and the measured sleep current I 9 =0.11mA, the expression (1) leads to the average value of 243μA. Fig. 13 illustrates the case when no network is available at that time. As expected, the MPWiNodeZ fails the discovery/joining process and continues to try every T 10 + T 3, assuming that the battery has enough energy. During this process, and considering a current consumption of 50mA during T 4 and 110μA otherwise (sleep times T 10 and T 3), the average value of current consumption is given by (2) 〈 i 〉 = 50 T 4 + 0.11 T 10 + 0.11 T 3 T 4 + T 10 + T 3 ( mA ) which for the intended application scope with T 10 =120s, T 3 =120s and T 4 =2s, results in an average current consumption of approximately 522μA. During the normal acquisition process, initiated on State 4, the μ-controller checks the battery conditions and loads from memory the operational rules that specify which channels to be sampled. Fig. 14 shows some waveforms that illustrate this procedure. The DC–DC converter that supplies the external sensors is turned-on during approximately 100ms in order to stabilize the voltage output. After this time, external sensors are sampled by the analog-to-digital converter which will enter automatically in a sleep mode after the required conversions. At the same time, if rules apply, the multiplexer is enabled to start averaging the pulse outputs from the power-management block (solar panel in this case). The bottom waveforms of Fig. 14 show this procedure. During this enable period, a pulse train appears at the output of the multiplexer in order to be filtered. After the necessary voltage stabilisation time, the amplifier is powered on, supplying the signal <PULSESP>, which is amplified by a factor of two, to the μ-controller internal ADC. The time that the multiplexer is enabled can also be observed in Fig. 12 after the State 4. As can be seen, at the end of time T 5, the sensors are turned on and data acquired. After that, the μ-controller enables the multiplexer and goes sleep mode again. After a period of 2s, it wakes and turns on the amplifier (current consumption has risen from 110μA to 400μA). After the acquisition, the MPWiNodeZ performs all computations and send the data samples over the ZigBee network. After the first evaluation phase, one MPWiNodeZ device, still operating as an RFD, was tested as an acquisition device operating under real conditions, as seen in Fig. 11, and sending real-time data over a ZigBee network. The objective of this second evaluation phase was the validation of the described state machine but under operation as a ZigBee network router. For this evaluation scenario, the ZigBee network topology has changed to one coordinator, two network routers (both MPWiNodeZ, one being under evaluation) and an end-device (located in the vineyard). The power supply current consumption of the router device has been traced and is shown in Fig. 15 , where it can be seen the router joining process (first 2s). After this first stage, the MPWiNodeZ operates as expected, routing packets from the end-device to the coordinator and vice-versa. As can be seen, a current consumption of almost 50mA at all times places significant demands on the power-management system, which may need an energy supplement harvested from the surrounding environment. Fig. 16 shows the battery voltage profile of the MPWiNodeZ device located in the vineyard. The battery was charged by the low-power solar panel that was also used to measure the solar irradiance. The result of this measurement is illustrated as the <PULSESP> value, which is only showed for battery correlation purposes. In this 6-day window, the battery was kept in the charging mode until its voltage reaches almost 4.2V. When it happens, the software procedure keeps the battery in a float condition providing a trickle charge mechanism. Data were received by the ZigBee coordinator at intervals of 60s, which we consider the most demanding condition in practice, considering the scope of this MPWiNodeZ application. The battery voltage profile depicted in Fig. 16 has been determined in low–medium solar irradiance values (less than 100W/m2), the batteries being charged with this energy source only. As can be seen, even with a data transmission every 60s, the battery voltage was always above 3.9V. 6 Final remarks and conclusions We have shown the feasibility of a ZigBee-based remote sensing network, intended for precision viticulture in the Demarcated Region of Douro. The network nodes are powered by batteries that are recharged with energy harvested from the environment. The power-management aspects have been found to be particularly critical, the main issues being the on–off cycles caused by partially charged batteries, and connectivity/network failures that lead to repeatedly unsuccessful connection attempts. We have designed the nodes to deal correctly with these issues, and tested the correctness of the solutions adopted by testing the nodes under particularly severe conditions. The testing and deployment of the devices was a two stage process. In the first stage, the devices were tested in the laboratory to validate the solutions that had been implemented, with particular emphasis on the power-management aspects. The power consumption profiles measured during the tests validated the software-based solution, based on a finite state machine. The second and final stage was the deployment of a network of devices in the field (see Fig. 11), a vineyard, with the cooperation of a winegrower. All results obtained so far confirm that the system works as envisaged, and operates reliably. We have concluded that the system nodes are able to sustain themselves based on solar energy alone; in other words, a ZigBee-based sensor network powered by batteries recharged by solar energy alone is feasible, if the networking and power-management issues are handled as proposed. No new hardware or software issues appeared when operating the system in the field. The system is in principle also able to harvest kinetic energy from wind and water in pipes. However, testing of these harvesting techniques has not been performed, for two reasons: first, these energy sources are more relevant to routers, which need a permanent energy supply, than to network nodes, which are less critical and can shut themselves off if necessary. Second, the performance of the nodes was our main concern and the main purpose of our study. The system was endowed with the possibility of harvesting from both solar and kinetic energy sources in anticipation of future applications, including for example applications in greenhouses. A router placed inside a greenhouse would clearly benefit from harvesting kinetic energy from water in pipes inside the greenhouse itself. The router current consumption of 50mA would drain fully charged 650mAh batteries in less than 13h. The fact that the amount of solar energy is likely to be reduced by the filtering effect of the greenhouse itself provides additional motivation to consider alternate energy sources. The testing of the router and nodes under such circumstances is planned and will be reported in a future work.

        "doc_abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to summarise the authors' experience in furthering the educative use of Information Technology and the internet in the primary schools of northeast Portugal. The main goal of the Programme \"Internet in Schools\" is the development of Information Technology in Portuguese schools. It focuses on the use of the technology, rather than on its immediate pedagogical use. The characteristics of the target regions help in understanding this aim: teachers and students, as well as the population in general, were largely unaware of the potential of IT in general. Design/methodology/approach - The project, the first and still the largest of its kind in Portugal, ultimately involved 1,137 schools, more than 1,700 teachers, and roughly 13,000 pupils. It was decided to centre the training process in the schools and communities themselves. The methodology implemented is distributed rather than centralised, and involves a series of school visits interspersed with training sessions. Findings - The transfer of the training process from the university campus to the schools and communities themselves allowed for a very high degree of teacher participation. The first school visit was vital, allowing for the creation of a strong feeling of empathy between the trainer and the teachers and pupils. This was undoubtedly one of the main factors that lead to an easier and more enthusiastic participation from the teachers. The efforts to put theory into practice in the classrooms were rewarded by a quicker rate of acceptance of IT in the classroom. The use of the internet, namely of web services and e-mail, was stimulated through the various training and awareness raising sessions (supported by Netmobiles) directed at the community in general. Such sessions enabled many individuals in the region to have their first contact with and experience of IT. This constitutes a sound and valuable contribution in terms of awareness raising, training and development towards IT in the region. The following factors played a very important role in the achievement of the goals: the training team was always present or could be easily contacted; both teachers and pupils contributed with material and resources; there was a continuous exchange of experiences; a vast number of individuals and entities participated in the project. Originality/value - This was the first and still the largest approach of its kind in Portugal, and this is the only paper purposing and describing the used methodology in detail and the main conclusions reached. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

Perpetual operation of a network node is undoubtedly one of the major goals of any energy-aware protocol or power-efficient hardware platform. Energy harvesting has emerged as the natural way to keep small stationary hardware platforms running, even when operating continuously as network routing devices. This paper analyses solar radiation, wind and water flow as feasible energy sources that can be explored to meet the energy needs of a wireless sensor network router within the context of precision agriculture, and presents a multi-powered platform solution for wireless devices. Experimental results prove that our prototype, the MPWiNodeX, can manage simultaneously the three energy sources for charging a NiMH battery pack, resulting in an almost perpetual operation of the evaluated ZigBee network router. In addition to this, the energy scavenging techniques double up as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed, a capability that avoids the use of specific sensors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The deployment of large mesh-type wireless networks is a challenge due to the multitude of arising issues. Perpetual operation of a network node is undoubtedly one of the major goals of any energy-aware protocol or power-efficient hardware platform. Energy harvesting has emerged as the natural way to keep small stationary hardware platforms running, even when operating continuously as network routing devices. This paper analyses solar radiation, wind and water flow as feasible energy sources that can be explored to meet the energy needs of a wireless sensor network router within the context of precision agriculture, and presents a multi-powered platform solution for wireless devices. Experimental results prove that our prototype, the MPWiNodeX, can manage simultaneously the three energy sources for charging a NiMH battery pack, resulting in an almost perpetual operation of the evaluated ZigBee network router. In addition to this, the energy scavenging techniques double up as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed, a capability that avoids the use of specific sensors. Keywords Energy harvesting Power management Energy sources Acquisition station Precision agriculture 1 Introduction The energy necessary for the deployment of stand-alone wireless sensor networks in large, open fields still dominates the overall system budget (Rabaey et al., 2000). The harvesting of energy from the surrounding space to power these systems is a solution being explored by several authors, including Wang et al. (2006); Thomas et al. (2006); Cantatore and Ouwerkerk (2006) and Priya et al. (2005). These works cover areas such as irrigation control systems, weather and environmental monitoring, greenhouse control, animal identification and health monitoring. But to effectively attain perpetual operation further enhancements in energy scavenging and more efficient power conditioning methods are required. In the case of precision agriculture (PA), massive amounts of data (Moreenthaler et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2006) are gathered to estimate, for instance, a growth profile, which suggests that sensors or even complete acquisition systems should be installed close to the plant itself. This implies dense ad-hoc networks of wireless devices, sufficiently flexible to support the disparate sources of data that can be extracted from the plant and its surrounding environment (Stafford, 2000). Besides, the wireless network should be able to cover a large area, which means that each acquisition device should be capable of operating as a network router. Fig. 1 shows an illustration of our motivation scenario where a ZigBee network is deployed on a vineyard management zone to collect environmental data. The harvested energy sources are usually ubiquitous in the nodes’ surrounding space but random in nature (Paradiso and Starner, 2005; Hande et al., 2007), a characteristic that dictates the use of energy reservoirs, typically rechargeable batteries or, more recently, ultracapacitors (Park and Chou, 2006). In the case of wireless nodes operating as network routers the energy demands are considerable, and several sources of energy, possibly of different nature, may be required. This raises questions about the power density associated with such sources, how to harvest and manage them to achieve self-sustained, perpetual operation (Corke et al., 2007). Design considerations regarding sensor networks, hardware design, network and medium access control protocols, battery management and harvesting techniques are discussed for instance in Raghunathan et al. (2005); Chou and Park (2005); Mainwaring et al. (2002) and Jiang et al. (2005). Dubois-Ferrière et al. (2006) describe TinyNode, a generic platform for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, which operates with a small solar panel used to replenish two separate energy buffers (primary and secondary). Although not intended for perpetual operation, the authors present an interesting and useful comparison between supercapacitors and batteries for variable operation duty-cycle. They also present a comparison between current consumption of similar platforms, the Mica2, the Telos Sky, the EyesIFX and the TinyNode. The solution to power indoor routers proposed by Hande et al. (2007) depends on a photonic energy harvesting device that consists of a set of solar cells connected in series-parallel to scavenge energy from 34 W fluorescent lights. However, the approach has drawbacks: on one hand, each router requires two nodes operating at 50% duty-cycle to minimise power consumption, a solution that duplicates the number of devices. On the other hand, it uses many solar cells that have to be located close to the lamps. Chou and Park (2005) mention the need for multiple power sources, but they regard this power fragmentation problem as a consequence of the fact that such energy sources may not be available at all times. Park and Chou (2006) review the Helicomote, the Prometheus, the Everlast and the PUMA as energy harvesting systems and present the AmbiMax, an energy harvesting circuit that uses a solar panel and a wind generator to charge a supercapacitor-based energy storage system. In this case, the authors have focused their research in the harvesting efficiency rather than in controlling the charging process to avoid, for instance, the battery aging issue. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how to take advantage of the existence of multiple energy sources in agricultural and livestock environments (open-field crops, greenhouses, hydroponic and aquaculture systems, and stables) by harvesting energy from the sun, wind and moving water, as discussed in Section 2. The energy harvesters used in our experiments comprise a small solar-panel, a small hydro-generator placed in a nearby irrigation or hydroponic water pipe and a wind generator prototype that was designed to be part of the supporting structure of each acquisition platform. Section 3 describes the power-management behind a wireless data acquisition platform (WDAP) that uses the energy harvested from the three sources to simultaneously replenish a common 650mAh NiMH battery pack, enabling almost perpetual operation of a network router with general-purpose data acquisition capabilities. Another feature of our approach, which complements the idea of harvesting from multiple sources, is to use the energy harvesting circuits as sensors of solar radiation and wind speed, which are relevant parameters in precision agriculture and other applications. This fusion or integration of the functions of generators and sensors makes conventional, separate sensors unnecessary. Regarding wireless network support, we have chosen (Morais et al., 2008) the ZigBee standard as a tool to create sensor an router nodes. Section 4 describes our main experimental results: laboratory as well as outdoor experiments confirm the feasibility of self-sustained near-perpetual operation of our WDAP. For this purpose we have built two similar data acquisition systems, targeted for different applications, their main difference being the wireless support. Our results also show that the built-in sensors provide measures that are in good agreement with those of conventional, reference sensors. Our conclusions and final remarks are presented in Section 5, which closes the paper. 2 Harvesting energy from the environment There is a variety of energy sources in the environment around a sensor network (Thomas et al., 2006; Paradiso and Starner, 2005) that are of potential interest for energy harvesting. They include photonic (includes solar energy as well as artificial lightning); vibrations (harvested using piezoelectric, electro-magnetic and capacitive converters); kinetic (available in moving water in rivers, pipes and wind flow); magnetic (magnetic fields surrounding AC power lines); pressure; and heat differentials (harvested using thermoelectric elements), where a comprehensive overview of these can be found in (Roundy et al., 2004). However, many of these sources may have to be neglected due to practical constraints or challenges raised by the low energy density, target power requirements and, in some cases, feasibility of the energy harvesting method. Solar energy is the most efficient natural energy source available for sensor networks in outdoor applications (Thomas et al., 2006). An understanding of the relative importance and potential of solar and wind energy requires data on solar irradiation and wind velocity. The PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System) on-line solar irradiation data utility, part of the SOLAREC action at the JRC Renewable Energies Unit of the European Commission (available at collects such data. The results for a few locations in Europe are summarised in Table 1 . It also includes wind data (the values for Vila Real were obtained by us, those for the other locations are available at The average horizontal irradiation for the city of Vila Real, northeast Portugal, is about 420.6 mWh/(cm2 day). A network router device with a 40mA continuous average current draw at 3.3V would require an energy of about 3168mWh/day, which can be harvested by a 10% efficient, 75.3cm2 solar panel. The active area of the solar panel has to increase to 215.1cm2 if we take the worst case value of 147.3mWh/(cm2 day) for the same location. If the solar panel inclination is optimal then the active area may be reduced to 130cm2. Table 1 also shows the average wind speed and the probability that the wind velocity exceeds the Beaufort value 4, which corresponds to an average wind velocity of 5.5–7.9m/s, or a median velocity of 6.7m/s, over a 10-min interval (see also Fig. 2 ). In the context of precision agriculture, and specially in hydroponic practices or close to irrigation systems, it makes sense to explore the kinetic energy from moving water. This can be harvested through a suitable hydro-generator and, as we will see, it may considerably supplement the WDAP energy reservoir. Our multi-source energy supply harvesting strategy, including the appropriate enclosure box, is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The WDAP is used in a vineyard management zone to collect data from soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation as a part of an on-going project. The energy is in this case supplied by sun, wind and moving water. In the latter case, the energy is harvested by a hydrogenerator located in a nearby irrigation pipe. 2.1 Solar-energy harvesting Solar-energy harvesting is based on the well-known principle of photo-voltaic conversion, and provides the highest power density (15 mWcm−2on a bright sunny day), making it the best-suited choice to power wireless acquisition systems in outdoor applications. Since the power output of small solar panels is limited, two main design principles for the solar-harvesting modules are considered. First, the system should extract the maximum power at each time instant and, second, the efficiency of the power management sub-systems should be maximised. In practice, strict adherence to these principles is difficult, and trade-offs have to be considered, due to the interaction of factors such as the characteristics of the solar cells and their active area, power conditioning features, application requirements of the wireless system and, the chemistry and capacity of the batteries used to store the harvested energy. But to maximise solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency the power conditioning subsystem should operate at the solar panels’ maximum power point (MPP), the point in the V–I characteristic that corresponds to the maximum power transfer. Our prototype, the MPWiNodeX platform, uses a commercial solar panel (MSX-005 from Solarex, USA) chosen because of its small size, availability and low cost. This 8-cell solar-panel has an active area of 57.0 mm × 95.8 mm (54.6cm2), a rated V oc of 4.6V and I sc of 160mA. The MPP occurs at a voltage of approximately 3.1V, which means that the power conditioning circuit should ensure operation at (or near) this point. Regarding the harvesting circuit, one approach is to clamp the output terminals of the solar panel to a rechargeable battery (Raghunathan et al., 2006). This forces the solar panel to operate at a point on its V–I curve determined by the battery’s terminal voltage. This has the advantage of minimising the energy losses in the transfer mechanism, but depends on a careful choice of battery and solar panel in order to ensure that the operating point of the system remains close to the MPP. In the cited example, two NiMH batteries are charged, via a blocking diode, by a solar panel with a MPP occurring at 3.0V. Battery voltage varies between 2.2 and 2.8V, and due to the voltage drop in the blocking diode, the voltage across the solar panel remains close to optimal. It only harvests energy when the solar panel output voltage is 0.7V higher then that of the battery which means that a significant amount of energy cannot be harvested. Moreover, there is no tracking of the MPP, which is essential to achieve high harvesting efficiency (Park and Chou, 2006). Also, the energy flow is unmanageable, resulting in uncontrolled daily recharge cycles and placing a significant stress on the battery. Our solution represents an integrated approach to the management and conditioning of the solar-panel, wind generator and hydrogenerator blocks (described in the following two sections). It includes a smart-battery charge control that balances battery lifetime and energy harvesting efficiency, as described in detail in Section 3.1. 2.2 Wind flow kinetic energy harvesting Wind flow kinetic energy can be harvested by a wind turbine which extracts energy from moving air by slowing it down and using the obtained energy to drive a generator. The power P w associated with a quantity of air of mass m, flowing at speed v in the x direction, is the time derivative of the kinetic energy: (1) P w = 1 2 ρ A d x d t v 2 = 1 2 ρ A v 3 , where ρ is the air density in kgm−3, A is the cross-sectional area in m2 and v is the upstream or undisturbed wind speed in m/s. An ideal turbine can extract a fraction of the power in (1) given by the Betz coefficient 16/27 or 59.26% (Betz, 1926). The power extracted by a practical turbine is (2) P m = C p 1 2 ρ A v 3 = C p P w . where C p is the performance coefficient of the turbine. Assuming that the turbine is coupled to a transmission with efficiency η m which drives a generator of efficiency η g , the electrical power P e available can be written as (3) P e = C p η m η g P w = C p η m η g 1 2 ρ A v 3 . Wind turbines can be classified into two general types based on the axis of rotation. Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) have the rotor shaft parallel to ground and must be pointed into the direction of wind flow by some means. They are usually used for large-scale windmills for electrical energy production. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have a vertically rotating main rotor shaft. Although less efficient, VAWTs offer some important advantages in small-scale wind generator design, the Darrieus and Savonious designs being the most common. They are omni-directional, simpler, can be fixed in both ends and can respond quicker to changes in wind direction and velocity. The Darrieus type is based on lift forces which cause the rotor to move faster than the wind. They are efficient but usually not self-starting. The Savonious type is less efficient because they are drag-type devices (S-shaped cross section) but they are self-starting and virtually maintenance-free. To design the wind generator suited for our application it is necessary to bear in mind a number of practical and functional issues. Firstly, the energy harvested from the wind is intended to supplement the energy available for battery charging. Secondly, the wind generator should double up as a sensor, and be capable of supplying data on wind speed. Finally, the wind generator should be part of the structure of the acquisition station and especially of the rod which stands vertically on the ground (right side of Fig. 3). This means that the turbine swept area, namely its diameter, should be minimised. To fulfil these requirements, a Savonious design was chosen, despite its inherent low efficiency. The power extraction coefficient could be increased by adding a convergent nozzle to increase the rotor speed (Shikha et al., 2003). However, this requires wind coming from a fixed direction, which is not the case in our application target. A free moving vane would force the convergent nozzle into the direction of the wind, and could be used to obtain information about wind direction. The efficiency can be improved in a more simpler way by adopting a multi-blade rotor design. Fig. 4 illustrates the two VAWT that were constructed to evaluate the wind energy harvesting techniques. The right one is based on a six-blade Savonious design with 60 mm diameter and 200mm height (0.012m2 swept area), while the left one is based on three-stage based design as proposed by Hayashi et al. (2005). Assuming air standard conditions(pressure of 101.3kPa and temperature of 273K) and a power coefficient C p of 0.1, these turbines should extract a mechanical power of 97mW at a wind speed of 5m/s. 2.3 Water-flow kinetic energy harvesting The energy of moving liquids in pipes, such as water or liquid nutrients, can be harvested with a small-size hydrogenerator. To our best knowledge, this approach has not been explored to supply energy to small electronic devices in precision agriculture. We regard the pipes of irrigation control systems as power outlets within the crops. This idea may be even more relevant in aquaculture or hydroponics practices, where water is always recirculating in pipes. This suggests the possibility of supplying power to a sensor network based on the energy harvested from these pipes. To explore and validate this concept, a commercial hydrogenerator was used as a energy harvester for our WDAP. This device, illustrated in Fig. 5 , was developed and patented by Vulcano to replace batteries in smart gas-based water heating appliances for residential applications. With a principle of operation similar to large hydroelectric generation systems, a small quantity of water, derived from the main duct, is used to spin a turbine coupled to a DC generator. Fig. 6 shows the results of our experiments, conducted with the hydrogenerator for different values of inlet water flow. As can be seen, the hydrogenerator output voltage is almost constant and independent of the water flow value. Due to this characteristic, the water volume cannot be accurately measured, but its logical state can (flowing/not flowing, useful for detecting liquid movements). 3 System architecture To evaluate the energy harvesting techniques as well as the data correlation between reference sensors and data gathered from the energy harvesters, two different WDAP were designed, differing mainly in wireless support. The first and simplest prototype, the MPWiNodeS variant, uses a low-cost 8-bit RISC μ -controller (PIC18LF2620 from Microchip, AZ, USA) and a low-power RF transceiver (RC1280 from Radiocrafts, Norway). This device is currently being used as a development platform for the inclusion of the IEEE 1451 standard for sensor/network interoperability (Wei et al., 2005; Sweetser et al., 2006), with the objective of defining the energy harvesters transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS). The second prototype, the MPWiNodeZ, uses a wireless μ -controller (JN5139 from Jennic, UK) with a ZigBee-compliant stack, and provides the necessary standardised software tools to rapidly deploy sensor and router nodes in the field. These devices follow the block diagram depicted in Fig. 7 . A detailed explanation of the diagram is given in the following subsections. 3.1 Power management The power conditioning subsystem (Fig. 8 ) is responsible for charging the NiMH battery pack with energy harvested from the three considered energy sources. Each source has its own conditioning block, based on a highly efficient boost converter with 3.3/5.0 V output voltage, pin selectable. This converter allows a wide range of input voltages below the battery nominal output, which enables harvesting from low-voltage sources. The shutdown pin is used to implement a pulse charging mechanism, which simultaneously performs MPP tracking to enhance harvesting efficiency. This signal is generated by a comparator with hysteresis powered by the battery due to its ultra-low quiescent current. When the voltage at the charge reservoir capacitor (see Fig. 8) rises above a particular value, the comparator turns the boost converter on, transferring the charge stored at that capacitor to the battery, causing the input voltage to drop. Dropping below the lower-trip point of the comparator will result in the turn-off of the converter. This pulsed operation results in a more efficient charging method (Zhang et al., 2004), where the density of the generated shutdown pulses is related with the capability of the energy source to replenish the input charge reservoir. This relation is, in this work, explored to provide a coarse estimation of the magnitude of the parameter that supplies the energy to the system. To this effect, a second comparator with open drain output is used to generate similar yet independent pulses. The other feature is the output voltage selection pin, used to select the 3.3 or 5.0 V predefined value, which are, in this case, below and above the operating limits of a 3-cell NiMH battery. This is used to define the start and stop conditions, battery charging and floating, respectively. The systems’ power supply is derived from a wide input range DC–DC converter (MAX710 from Maxim, USA). Among other features, it has a low-battery indicator (LBI signal in Fig. 8) that is used to signal the μ -controller when the battery voltage falls below a predefined value, suitable for predicting the power-off. The μ -controller is responsible for sampling the battery voltage value and to control the operation of the conditioning subsystem. When the battery achieves a pre-programmed value, which could be the battery fully charged (BFC) voltage value, a normally closed power switch is used to break the charging path. This switch may also be used for discharging completely the battery as a way to minimise the aging issue by periodically promoting, if necessary, a full discharge/charge cycle. 3.1.1 Solar-panel power-conditioning block When conditioning solar energy, the boost converter described above is a more suited choice since it enables harvesting even in that cases that the solar panel output voltage is lower than the in-charging battery voltage level. As the internal resistance of the photovoltaic cells depends on the light levels, which causes a loss of efficiency when connecting it to the boost converters’ inductor, the input charge reservoir capacitor introduces two important improvements. By monitoring the voltage on this capacitor, the comparator turns on the boost converter when the solar panel voltage output is at its MPP. The comparator will turn-off the converter without allowing the converter’s input voltage to drop below its operating voltage limit. The turn-off condition will remain until the solar panel output voltage rises again to the optimum voltage. The input capacitor also provides a low-impedance path for the inductor current, which allows the efficient bang-bang control of charge transfer (Maxim, 2000). Fig. 9 illustrates the principle of operation of this bang-bang control, where it is also shown how the density of the charge transfer burst pulses are correlated with the received solar radiation intensity. It can be followed that the pulse density ( V PULSE,SP in Fig. 9) increases as the solar irradiance rises, which we regard as a solar radiation sensor output. 3.1.2 Wind generator and hydrogenerator power-conditioning blocks The wind generator is based on a four permanent magnet generator, which creates an alternating sinusoidal voltage with an amplitude and frequency proportional to the extracted wind mechanical power. Depending on the possible electrical connections that we can make with four windings, a rectifier is used before connecting this voltage source to the input of the power-conditioning block. A two-diode full-wave rectifier topology provides the higher electrical power extraction but causes more electromagnetic breaking, because current flows during the entire period. This leads to an equivalent higher starting torque when the DC value reaches the equivalent MPP. In other words, when the DC output from the generator reaches the ON switching condition of the boost converter, a higher current flows in all windings which causes breaking. To reduce this starting torque (enabling operation at lower speeds with the penalty of a lower efficiency) we have followed the half-wave rectifier approach to allow harvesting energy from low-speed winds. However, a power routing scheme can be implemented to switch from the half-wave to the full-wave rectifier mode whenever the wind speed is above a determined value. Power conditioning of these two generators is accomplished by the same principle of operation of the solar-panel power-conditioning block. The differences are the values (resistors in this case) that define the MPP for each energy harvester. The wind generator and hydrogenerator high trip-values were set to approximately 2.0 and 1.6 V, respectively. 3.1.3 Battery charge control The battery charging start and stop conditions are asserted by the μ -controller by means of the selection pin ( 3 / 5 ¯ ) of each boost converter (see Fig. 8). To this effect, the battery voltage is sampled periodically to monitor when it becomes fully charged. When it happens, the μ -controller sets the 3 / 5 ¯ line which causes the boost converter to be turned off because the output voltage is greater than the selected predefined output voltage. If the battery is actually discharging, and its voltage drops below some predefined value, the μ -controller may clear the 3 / 5 ¯ pin, which starts, or resumes, a charging cycle. At first sight, the selection of the switching points is straightforward. The voltage across a 3-cell NiMH battery should not exceed 3 × 1.45V = 4.35V, where 1.45V corresponds to a fully charged NiMH cell. To minimise battery aging, the discharge cycle should last until the voltage falls down to 3 × 0.9V = 2.7V, where 0.9V is the voltage across a completely discharged cell (Ying et al., 2006; Fetcenko et al., 2007). To avoid a fully discharged cell, even knowing that a residual energy may exist, we decided to limit the lower bound to a 3V value. Due to power fragmentation it becomes necessary to balance battery lifetime and energy harvesting efficiency. To better understand the need for the trade-off, consider that the battery is discharging, and that its voltage is, for instance, 3.7V; assume now that, at this stage, an external unpredictable energy source becomes available. Should this fact be ignored and the battery be allowed to continue discharging until its voltage reaches 3.3V? Or should the battery be recharged while the unpredictable energy source is present? It is clear that the strict maximisation of the battery lifetime implies the sub-optimal use of the harvested energy, and increases the probability of running out of power. On the other hand, any attempt to use as much harvested energy as possible might severely limit the duration of the batteries as a result of uncontrolled charging cycles. To overcome this issue, a software-based solution has been implemented. With access to the actual battery voltage value, a software procedure sets the trip voltage values so that complete discharge cycles can be periodically performed, thus yielding a long battery lifetime, and, simultaneously, good harvesting efficiency. 3.2 Data acquisition platform Targeted to PA applications, our WDAP comprises an analog interface based on a low-power analog-to-digital converter (AD7888BRZ from Analog Devices, USA), featuring eight analog inputs with 12-bit resolution (Fig. 7). External general-purpose sensors supply is accomplished by a separate DC–DC converter that is turned on only during the acquisition process. Data from the power-conditioning subsystem, such as the signals from the energy harvesters and the battery voltage sample value, are handled in a different way. The pulses generated by each power conditioning block comparators’ to control the corresponding boost converter are filtered before the analog-to-digital conversion takes place. This is done with an RC filter at the output of a low-power 4:1 multiplexer. The sampled battery voltage is taken by a separate analog channel, through a voltage divider enabled by an analog switch to save energy. 4 Experimental results The energy harvesting methods were evaluated in two different devices (the -S and -Z variants, shown in Fig. 10 ). A MPWiNodeS device was installed outside our laboratory with the purpose of sending periodically solar irradiance, relative humidity, outside temperature and battery voltage data to a base station. This device is being used in a long-term evaluation of the proposed WDAP. Other similar device was used in the laboratory to an in-depth analysis of the power-conditioning subsystem waveforms. On the other hand, a MPWiNodeZ device was deployed in a vineyard as a ZigBee network node to evaluate, in-field, the energy harvesters performance (Fig. 11 ). The performance of the wind turbine was evaluated using a wind tunnel (4 m length, 0.4 m × 0.4 m cross-sectional area). Fig. 12 shows the relevant waveforms obtained with the correspondent power-conditioning block. The pulsed output was filtered to extract its DC value, yielding V ¯ PULSE,WIND . This evaluation was performed at various air speed values which has lead to the transfer function of Fig. 12. As can be seen, V ¯ PULSE,WIND is proportional to wind speed, the linearised transfer function being approximately given by (4) wind velocity = 1 118.3 V ¯ PULSE,WIND + 2.15 ( m/s ) , where V ¯ PULSE,WIND is in mV. For speeds below approximately 2.1 m/s the voltage output from the turbine is not enough ( V WIND < 2 V) for turning on the boost converter, which indicates that this speed value is the minimum value that enables battery charging (as well as data from wind speed). As expected, the extracted electrical power (measured directly on the generator with a resistive load), follows a cubic-law, accordingly to (1). Fig. 13 shows the behaviour of the hydrogenerator power-conditioning block. To illustrate the start charging procedure, the F / C ¯ signal is asserted low to select the charging mode. Until that, the hydrogenerator was operating without any electrical load. As can be seen, the battery starts charging and the power-conditioning block maintains the hydrogenerator working at its MPP (approximately at 1.5 V), by means of the SHDN ¯ HYDRO signal. For the field evaluation of the MPWiNodeS device, eight sensors were used for measuring air temperature (LM50B from National Semiconductor, USA), solar radiation (TSL230 and TSL251 from Texas Instruments, USA) and air relative humidity (HIH-3610 from Honeywell, USA) for creating a discharging profile and measure current consumption. In addition, data from solar radiation (obtained from the solar panel), wind speed (obtained from the wind turbine) and from battery were also transmitted to the base station for posterior analysis. The operation mode was deliberately set to be a relatively high duty-cycle, 10 s in a 60s time-frame (16.7%). To get quicker results, a battery with a lower capacity (220mAh) was used. The result of this evaluation period, regarding the battery behaviour, is shown in Fig. 14 where solar irradiance is also shown. The evaluation was performed over a period of variable weather (cloudy, foggy and bright, winter days). It can be seen that the battery stop charging control has keeping the battery voltage below 4.2 V, although it would be possible to go beyond that value. The MPWiNodeZ device, as a ZigBee network router, was also evaluated. Table 2 summarises the obtained results. By gathering data from V ¯ PULSE,SP and from the TSL230 solar radiation sensor, the transfer function illustrated in Fig. 15 was obtained. 5 Conclusions and final remarks In principle, the energy required to permanently operate the wireless data acquisition nodes and routers in a large sensor network can be obtained by harvesting energy sources present in the environment. Our multi-powered platform was designed for applications in precision agriculture, and focuses on solar and kinetic energy sources (wind and water in pipes). The system that we built proves that the three harvesting methods suffice to supply a generic WDAP energy store. Even with low values of solar radiation, the combination of the three energy sources has supplied an energy of about 58 mAh, more than the 39mAh required by network routers. We have observed that the wind turbine is able to generate an important fraction of the harvested energy, in certain cases close to the needs of router nodes. Improving these generators may pay off in the future, particularly in applications where irrigation pipes are absent. At the opposite extreme one finds applications in greenhouses, hydroponic or aquaculture systems, in which case the wind is unlikely to play a major role but moving water in pipes is abundant, reversing the relative importance of wind turbines and hydro-generators. Another novelty of our approach is the double functionality of the power management block, which in addition to its usual role also doubles as a sensing device for the parameters that are usually monitored in agricultural environments. Our results and in particular Figs. 15 and 16 confirm that a coarse value of wind speed and solar irradiance can be measured by the corresponding energy harvester without the need for specific sensors. This is yet another advantage of the idea of harvesting from multiple energy sources: when the energy sources are related to parameters that the sensor network needs to measure, the amount of harvested energy may itself yield an estimate of the parameter, making conventional sensors unnecessary. Several improvements to the basic ideas underlying this paper are possible, some of which are presently under study. The system could for example keep a record of each harvested energy source, and use it to predict its future availability. The use of Lithium batteries and ultracapacitors is also being evaluated as a way to slow down battery aging by absorbing the transient power and to minimise the issue described in Section 3.1.3.

The measurement principle is based on the heat-pulse method for soil moisture and water flux measurements and in a Wenner array for soil electrical conductivity. To promote the deployment of these sensing devices across large areas, such as irrigation fields, the ZigBee standard has been adopted as a multi-hop, ad-hoc network enabler. The core of the MFPz device is a wireless microcontroller (with a built-in ZigBee stack) that builds upon an IEEE 802.15.4 radio device. A 7.2Ah NiHM battery that is charged by a solar panel powers the MFPz device.

Keywords Microsystem Electrical resistivity sensor Wireless interface Estrus prediction 1 Introduction Monitoring progesterone levels in milk is an effective method not only for predicting ovulation, and thus time to artificial insemination, but also for detecting pregnancy and fertility problems. Laboratorial measurements, based on radio-immunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodology, have allowed estrus detection with 98% specificity, but these methods require time and specific skills [1]. Several approaches have been developed by researchers to determine progesterone in milk and blood [2–4]. Other studies have shown that electrical impedance in vaginal mucus may be used to pinpoint proper insemination time [5]. Decreasing electrical resistance (ER) values were always associated with the onset of estrus. Nevertheless it should be kept in mind that vulvar ER measurements vary among cows. A suitable solution should monitor the relative changes within cows during the estrus cycle. Once the ER readings begin to decline, the cow should be probed more frequently until the lowest reading is obtained. Complementary to the ER variation during the estrus cycle, a temperature variation is also present and can be correlated. It has been reported that 12 h before ovulation the vaginal temperature increase from 37.94 ± 0.33 to 39.00 ± 0.64 ° C, as compared to the pre-estrus value [6]. It was also reported that the prediction of estrus based on vaginal temperature was excellent when an increase of at least 0.4 ° C in vagina temperature was observed for 3 or more consecutive hours [7]. The combination between these two parameters not only allows a greater specificity in prediction, but enables the conception of a complete and autonomous microsystem for ER and body temperature measurements, suitable to be implanted in the cow vulvar muscle. To achieve this purpose some key issues have been specially addressed: measurement methods, data transfer, power consumption and package (or encapsulation). System conception and measurement methods are presented. 2 System overview The specificity of the proposed methodology dictates that size and type of encapsulation is a major concern. For a reliable and long-term operation, the device must be small, bio-compatible and power-efficient. Regarding energy consumption, data transfer is accomplished by using a highly efficient RF-transmitter operating in class-E mode to transfer small data packets every hour to a receiver device located in the cow collar. Issues concerning data exchange with a collecting and/or processing station are not discussed here. Sensor implementation for measuring ER is based on a four-point electrode arrangement which consists of outer-current injecting electrodes and inner-voltage measurement electrodes with the same separation distance between every electrode. This arrangement is called Wenner alpha type, which has been modified to allow measurements using four conductive strips in the perimeter of the package, as depicted in Fig. 1 . In a Wenner structure, two electrodes (A and B) are used to create a current that flows away from or towards each electrode across the surface. The total potential difference between the electrodes M and N is given by [8]: (1) V MN = V M − V N = ρ I 2 π 1 AM ¯ − 1 MB ¯ − 1 AN ¯ − 1 NB ¯ where ρ represents the surface resistivity ( Ω m) and I is the current (A) that flows between electrodes A and B. Eq. () may be rearranged to yield: (2) V MN = ρ I K where (3) K ≡ 2 π 1 AM ¯ − 1 MB ¯ − 1 AN ¯ − 1 NB ¯ − 1 is the “geometric factor” that will acquire a particular value for a given electrode spacing. For the Wenner array, all of the separations are equal to a constant value a and the Wenner geometric factor assumes the simple form K = 2 π a . Thus, the apparent resistivity is (4) ρ = V MN I K By knowing the injected current value I, ER variations can be accomplished by measuring the potential difference V MN at the inner electrodes. Temperature variations are detected by using a precision temperature sensor, thermally connected to a metal strip outside the capsule (fifth strip in Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows a simplified block diagram of the entire system. The excitation block, basically a sine-step current source, generates an ac current that flows through outer electrodes A and B. The measurement block is responsible for analog multiplexing and for analog-to-digital conversion. The core of this block is a second-order delta–sigma ( Δ Σ ) modulator, implemented in a fully differential topology using switched-capacitor techniques. The output of the Δ Σ modulator (bitstream) is then applied to a first-order digital filter to provide a 14-bit word. The associated control logic is responsible for controlling the analog multiplexer and for digital word synchronization, regarding the temperature sensor and potential difference samples. For data transmission, digital samples are assembled in a frame containing ID, preamble and checksum control fields. Prior to transmission, data is encoded as a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal and then transmitted, by means of amplitude shift-keying (ASK) modulation, through a power amplifier operating at 433.92 MHz ISM band in class-E mode. The RF frequency is generated by an on-chip frequency synthesizer based on a 13.56 MHz crystal. The temperature sensor, developed in a previous work [9], is a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) circuit with bipolar devices fabricated in the CMOS process. It uses a dynamic PTAT voltage generator with thirty two switching stages using dynamic element matching and dynamic amplification techniques to achieve a high-performance temperature sensor with high accuracy (better than 0.1%) and high resolution (better than 0.05 ° C, typical 0.01 ° C). 3 Electrical bio-impedance One of the classic signs of estrus in cows is a swollen vulva. Such swelling is the result of changes in tissue hydration, which causes changes in ER [10]. Changes in cell density, fluid volume, and electrolyte content of bovine vulvar tissue can be accomplished by considering the living tissue as an electrical circuit. The simplified circuit used to simulate electrical properties of a biological subject includes parallel resistance R e (extracellular space resistance) to serially connected R i (intracellular space resistance) with C m (membrane capacitance), as depicted in Fig. 3 . To determine tissue water and composition a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) technique is used. This technique is an assessment of changes in a biological object reflected by the capacitive reactance, resistance, and other factors for an indication of any alteration in the tissue composition. 4 Measurement methods The biological object impedance is measured by injecting a small alternating current, i ext ( t ) , of constant amplitude at a fixed frequency through the tissue by using two electrodes. The current injection develops a voltage distribution on the periphery of the tissue, related to the impedance distribution of the interior, which is measured using two adjacent electrodes. This voltage drop, v ( t ) , can be seen as the product of Z ˙ X times i ext ( t ) , as depicted in Fig. 4 . A shift in the phase angle between the injected current and the measured voltage drop defines reactance or a complex impedance measurement including the dielectric non-conducting space attributed to cell membrane capacitance. In clinical practice, and for most of the numerous experiments published in the literature [11], the BIA measurements are conduced using a four-electrode, or tetrapolar, method with a fixed frequency of about 50 kHz. The reason for this value is that it reduces electrode polarization anomalies and it ideally cancels the influence of the electrode–electrolyte interface impedance [12]. 4.1 Excitation circuit To efficiently measure ac impedance, an integrated sinusoidal current source is needed. Most sine current generators are based on a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), which requires a read-only memory (ROM) sine look-up table and a current-mode digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This solution requires a large integration area since waveform generation is closely related to the ROM size and the DAC resolution. Instead of using such approach a set of precisely scaled current mirrors can be used to produce sine steps as depicted in Fig. 5 . Switches S0 to S5 are turned ON by an up/down counter to produce a half-sine wave, where individual current mirrors ( M 2 , 0 , … , M 2 , 5 ) have been calculated to perform an accurate sine current step. Excitation current i ext ( t ) (equivalent to a rectified sine waveform) is then mirrored by a wide swing cascade current mirror (M5, M6) and transformed to a full wave by the switching network formed by switches SA, SB, SC and SD. The reference current I REF is generated by a bandgap reference circuit and can be adjusted externally during prototype evaluation. 4.2 Measurement circuit Voltage drop at the inner electrodes of the array is characterized by its amplitude (real part of the measured impedance) and the phase shift between the injected current and the measured voltage. Both values must be acquired to calculate the value of the complex impedance Z ˙ X . The amplitude measurement is based on two peak detectors that detect and hold the minimum and the maximum values of the difference between signals at the measuring electrodes, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Due to the switching action of the excitation circuit, the voltage across Z ˙ X appears with some induced glitches caused by SA, SB, SC and SD. Because of this, two first-order gm-C filters are used before the difference amplifier. This type of filter, where gm cells replace resistors, offers several advantages for this application such as low-area, low-power and more accurate integrated filters. The difference amplifier has a fixed gain of five and has been designed using switched-capacitor techniques. The output dc level has been set to the common-mode voltage of the fully differential Δ Σ modulator, allowing both peak detectors to operate within the input dynamic range of the modulator. It should be kept in mind that the use of the minimum peak detector, whose output value is theoretically the opposite of the maximum value, doubles the signal dynamic range and enables the use of fully differential structures. Advantages of using fully differential topologies, such as the case of the Δ Σ modulator, are the reduction of the common-mode interference, switch charge injection and clock feedthrough. Also, and since we are only interested in the amplitude of the measured waveform, the usage of both peak detectors reduces substantially the bandwidth requirements of the Δ Σ modulator. Phase shift between the applied sine wave and the obtained signal is measured through a phase detector that consists of a differential pair and a comparator, as basically depicted in Fig. 7 . The output of the comparator is then applied to a counter clocked by the same clock signal of the Δ Σ modulator to estimate pulse-width T p . While one of the inputs is tied to electrodes dc level ( V CM ), the other is connected to one of the active electrodes. When opening switch SA (see Fig. 5) and closing SB, the input V 1 surges over V CM due to the capacitive effect of the complex impedance. With this circuit, the duration of the pulse produced by the comparator is proportional to the phase shift of the Z ˙ X impedance. However, and as stated in [13], due to the use of a medium frequency (50 kHz, for example), the capacitive part of the complex impedance can be neglected. Nevertheless, and for future experiments in accessing tissue composition, this block will be integrated as a part of the measuring circuit. 5 Data transfer and encapsulation For a feasible operation and continuous surveillance of a cow, the proposed device must remain permanently on the proper anatomical location for the duration of the animal’s productive life. One of the requirements dictates that all subsystems must follow low-power and low-voltage design guidelines. In every radio-frequency device, power consumption during transmissions is a major parcel in power budget, even in highly efficient transmitters. To minimize this restriction, as well as power consumption regarding computational power, data is transmitted to a receiver unit located in a cow collar for further processing. Considering that a receiver is also included, a significant improvement in device lifetime can be achieved since measured data is only needed during the cow estrus cycle. So, data transfer can occur in a dynamic way to reduce power consumption during the times that monitoring is not needed, such as when the cow is pregnant. This is controlled by the receiver unit that issues an interrogation command that wakes up the device, which responds with a data frame and immediately enters in sleep mode. Interrogation commands are issued at a frequency dictated by the cow’s estrus cycle starting with a 12-h period and achieving a 1-h period when tracking minimum ER and maximum temperature values. The receiver unit, besides device interrogation function, is also responsible for data exchange within a wireless mesh-topology network, such as ZigBee ™ . On the other hand, a proper encapsulation must be addressed to ensure that after the device is implanted it presents no discomfort to the animal. To avoid tissue damage or electrode degradation, the electrodes are made with stainless steel (noble metals such as Pt or Au can also be used). The electrodes are located outside the plastic capsule, containing in its interior a Li-ion battery and the antenna. After assembly, the package can be hermetically sealed. 6 Results To fulfill the requirements of a fully autonomous implantable capsule, several subsystems are being designed, simulated and tested. For this prototype, a macrodevice, regarding the measuring method, has been built to validate the proposed methodology. Simulations were performed in T-Spice from Tanner Tools using the SPICE typical models from the AMI C07M-A CMOS process, available through Europractice program. The simulated voltages present at the measuring electrodes M and N are shown in Fig. 8 . This simulation corresponds to an alternating current of approximately 52 kHz. Fig. 9 shows the difference between the voltages present at the measuring electrodes, illustrating the sine step current. Voltages at the measuring electrodes, V M and V N , are then individually applied to a first-order gm-C filter and the result is applied to the difference amplifier. Fig. 10 shows the simulated response of the two peak detectors fed by the output of the amplifier. To simulate the behavior of the implantable capsule, some plastic cylinders with the four-electrode array have been built with different electrode separations, as depicted in Fig. 11 . The materials used (PVC for the cylinder and stainless steel for the electrodes) were specifically chosen to ensure biocompatibility. In order to keep the electrodes in place, a small chamfer was carved around the external side of the cylinder. All electrical connections were made on the inside of the cylinder, which was then filled with a non-conductive glue. To simulate the electrical conductivity of the vaginal mucus, each capsule was then placed in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (0.08 mol L−1 at 23 ° C). At this stage, capsule evaluation was performed by a macrodevice, Fig. 12 , where discrete electronic components were employed to generate a sine step current source. This macrodevice, beside the current source, filters and peak detectors, has a 14-bit analog-to-digital converter, a microcontroller and a RS232 driver to acquire and transfer collected data to a laptop computer for posterior analysis. Fig. 13 shows the results of some measurements. Fig. 13 shows the injected sine wave corresponding to an ac current of amplitude of approximately 660 μ A RMS (933 μ A peak ) and frequency of 52 kHz. The waveforms at both outputs of the amplifier and peak detector are shown in Fig. 13(minimum not shown). The peak detector output indicates a value of 921 mV (gain of the amplifier was set to 10), which is consistent with a 100 Ω resistance measurement. In fact, for a specific capsule with its particular cell constant value, the result is the inverse of the measured conductance, which was 9.8 mS. The inverse of the conductance is the resistance leading to a measured value of 102 Ω . 7 Conclusions The preliminary results suggests that the proposed implantable microsystem for vulvar ER and body temperature measurements can fulfill the requirements of a low-cost autonomous system to help estrus prediction in herd management. The major advantage of the presented solution is the capability of continuous monitoring of two correlated parameters in estrus detection during a long period of time without human intervention. A prototype, comprising the excitation and measurement circuits, as well as the RF transmitter, is being implemented in a standard CMOS 0.7 μ m mixed-signal process (AMIS C07M-A) to validate the proposed methodology. Previous implementations [14,9] have shown that the delta–sigma modulator exhibits an effective 16.1-bit resolution (98.7 dB dynamic range) with an 800 Hz bandwidth. The temperature sensor has a 0.05 ° C precision, which is suitable to detect very small variations of temperature, which is also closely associated with the onset of standing estrus and the pre-ovulatory surge in Luteinizing hormone (LH). Another important advantage is related to calibration. Since the proposed capsule will monitor relative changes of temperature and ER during the estrus cycle of different animals, absolute readings are not necessary, thus avoiding calibration of the device. After fabrication of this prototype, a set of long-term experiments will be scheduled to test the reliability of the capsule, which will be at the proper anatomical location of the animal. During this evaluation phase, the prototype will be scaled down to a 3.3 V CMOS process (AMIS C035M-A) to allow a single Li-ion cell as power source. Some improvements are also scheduled such as a receiver to control device shutdown and wake-up modes. To our knowledge, it’s the first time that an implantable capsule with a circular strip Wenner array and a microsystem is used to predict estrus in dairy cows. The key of the proposed measurement method is the correlation of the ER and temperature variation, which have been used separately to predict estrus, each one with a reasonable specificity. By combining these two parameters, we not only increase specificity but also the reliability of the prediction. References [1] M.N. Velasco-Garcia T.

Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 227 Practical implementations are possible up to a certain truncation error, which generally tends to be more of a concern when the kernel has infinite support and slow decay (such as the sinc function). B-splines have compact support, and as a result the value of a certain signal sample cannot influence the reconstruction outside a certain finite interval. The kernel function will often lead to a Riesz sequence or a Riesz basis. Riesz bases are a generalization of orthonormal bases, and can be regarded as the result of applying a bounded invertible operator to the elements of an orthonormal basis. A Riesz sequence, on the other hand is an “incomplete basis,” as it is merely a Riesz basis for the closed linear span of the set of functions under consideration. The numerical stability of the representations is very important in practice, as it dictates the magnitude of the effect of dealing with imperfect data. The stability of Riesz bases and Riesz sequences can be measured by looking at the size of their Riesz bounds. Orthonormal bases are perfect from the viewpoint of numerical stability, and their Riesz bounds are both equal to unity. As the ratio of the upper to the lower bound increases, the numerical stability of the representation decreases. It is well known [3], that the tighter (closer to each other) these bounds are the less any small perturbations in the input data will be felt at the output. This paper points out that the Riesz bounds associated with bases built using certain linear combinations of B-splines are better from the stability point of view than bases directly based on B-splines. The notation used is standard: L 2 is the space of all quadratically Lebesgue integrable f , with norm bardblf bardbl 2 := ( integraltext |f | 2 ) 1/2 and inner product 〈f,g〉:= integraltext fg ∗ . The space lscript 2 is its discrete counterpart (quadratically summable sequences), with the usual norm and inner product. The Fourier transform ˆ f of f is ˆ f(w)= ∞ integraldisplay −∞ f(t)e −jwt dt, implying an inverse given by f(t)= 1 2π ∞ integraldisplay −∞ ˆ f(w)e jwt dw. Section 2 provides the necessary background and describes the kernels used, and Section 3 deals with the stability issues. The spaces V ϕ generated by the kernels are discussed in Section 4, and the analysis filters are computed in Section 5. 2. The general sampling scheme It is well known that substitution of the sinc kernel by other functions more adjusted to the specific problem considered may lead to better approximations [4–6]. B-splines are a possibility, and their advantages are well known [2]. Consider the signal space [7] V ϕ := braceleftbigg f(t)= summationdisplay c k ϕ(t − k): c k ∈ l 2 bracerightbigg , k∈Z 228 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 Fig. 1. Typical sampling scheme. Usually, the analysis and synthesis filters are low-pass, i.e., h(t) = ϕ(t) = sinc(t),forT = 1. In the general case they must satisfy the bi-orthogonality condition 〈ϕ(t −k),ϕ ◦ (t −l)〉=δ k−l . where we have chosen the sampling step T = 1. When the function ϕ generates a Riesz basis, the coefficients c k completely characterize the signal. When ϕ is the sinc function, the coefficients c k are essentially the signal samples, but in the more general case they are given by the inner product between f and ϕ ◦ k , i.e., c k =〈f,ϕ ◦ k 〉. See Fig. 1. The family {ϕ ◦ k } is dual to {ϕ k } and its Fourier transform is given by [8] ˆ ϕ ◦ (w) = ˆϕ(w) summationtext k∈Z |ˆϕ(w + 2πk)| 2 . (1) In the least squares sense this means that P V ϕ f = summationdisplay k∈Z angbracketleftbig f,ϕ ◦ k angbracketrightbig ϕ k , where P V ϕ f denotes the projection of f in V ϕ . Butzer et al. [9] studied interpolation and approximation problems in which the sinc kernel is replaced by certain interpolation functions ϕ i with compact support, among which the following will be relevant for us: ϕ 1 (t) = M 2 (t), ϕ 2 (t) = 4M 3 (t) − 3M 4 (t), ϕ 6 (t) = M 4 (t) + 1 3 M 2 (t) − 1 6 parenleftbig M 2 (t + 1) + M 2 (t − 1) parenrightbig , ϕ 7 (t) = 4M 4 (t) + 1 2 parenleftbig M 4 (t + 1) + M 4 (t − 1) parenrightbig − 2 parenleftbig M 5 (t + 1/2) + M 5 (t − 1/2) parenrightbig . These interpolating kernels are linear combinations of the B-splines defined by M n (t) = braceleftbigg summationtext ceilingleftn/2−|t|ceilingright j=0 (−1) j n(n/2−|t|−j) n−1 j!(n−j)! , |t|lessorequalslantn/2, 0, |t| >n/2, where ceilingleftxceilingright denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x. They can also be represented in terms of their Fourier transforms ˆ M n (w) = bracketleftbigg sinw/2 w/2 bracketrightbigg n ,w∈ R. Plots are shown in Fig. 2. M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 229 Fig. 2. Interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 ,andϕ 7 . Although Butzer et al. have discussed a wider class of functions, here we use only those with the interpolation property (see Ref. [9] for details). 3. Stability and Riesz bounds The set of integer translations of a B-spline generates a Riesz basis. In fact, the following result holds [10]. Theorem 1. For any function φ ∈ L 2 (R) and constants 0 <αlessorequalslantβ<∞ the following two statements are equivalent: (i) {φ(·−k): k ∈ Z} satisfies the Riesz condition with Riesz bounds α and β; that is, for any {c k }∈l 2 , α summationdisplay k∈Z |c k | 2 lessorequalslant vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble summationdisplay k∈Z c k φ(·−k) vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble 2 2 lessorequalslantβ summationdisplay k∈Z |c k | 2 . (ii) The Fourier transform ˆ φ of φ satisfies α lessorequalslant summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ φ(w + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 lessorequalslantβ, almost everywhere. The Riesz bounds corresponding to the B-splines and the linear combinations of B- splines used by Butzer et al. can now be found. Setting w = 2x and φ(w)= M n (w) we see 230 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 that summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M n (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle sin[(2x + 2πk)/2] (2x + 2πk)/2 vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle 2n = summationdisplay k∈Z sin 2n (x + πk) (x + πk) 2n = sin 2n x summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + πk) 2n , wherewehaveusedsin 2n (x + πk)= sin 2n x. It is known [11] that summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + πk) 2n =− 1 (2n − 1)! d 2n−1 dx 2n−1 cotx, which immediately yields summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M n (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 2n x (2n − 1)! d 2n−1 dx 2n−1 cotx. (2) Now, with the help of (2), we find for M 1 ˜ f 1 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 1 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 2 x (2 − 1)! d 2−1 dx 2−1 cotx = 1, (3) that is, α = β = 1. For M 2 we have ˜ f 2 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 2 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 4 x 3! d 3 dx 3 cotx = 1 3 parenleftbig 1 + 2 cos 2 x parenrightbig . (4) This equation has its minimum 1/3atx = π/2(orw = π), and its maximum 1 at x = w = 0, i.e., α = 1/3 and β = 1. Inthesameway, ˜ f 3 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 3 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 6 x 5! d 5 dx 5 cotx = 1 15 parenleftbig 2 + 11 cos 2 x + 2 cos 4 x parenrightbig . (5) The minimum is α = 2/15 and the maximum is β = 1.

Plot of the periodic functions ˜ φ 1 , ˜ φ 2 , ˜ φ 6 ,and ˜ φ 7 , associated to the Riesz bases generated by the ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 ,andϕ 7 .

Note that the largest variation, 1 − α 1 ≈ 0.667, occurs for ˜ φ 1 and the smallest 1 − α 2 ≈ 0.414 for ˜ φ 2 . Table 1 summarizes the bounds, and shows that the linear combinations of B-splines ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 , lead to more stable representations than the B-splines M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , M 4 , and M 5 for equivalent polynomial spaces. Compare, for example, the bounds associated with M 5 and ϕ 7 , both of the 4th degree. 4. The spaces V ϕ Suppose that the spaces V a and V b are generated by ϕ a and ϕ b , respectively. It is known [3] that when the Riesz bounds of V a are tighter than those of V b , the representations pro- duced in V a are numerically more stable. This statement is clear when ϕ a and ϕ b generate the same space, i.e., V a = V b . In the more general case V a negationslash= V b the comparison is less straightforward. This will now be discussed. We note that already in [7] the authors considered the spaces generated by integer trans- lations of a generating function ϕ a , and linear combinations of the translations of the same generating function (what the authors call equivalent basis functions). Generally, when the sampling set T approaches zero, the approximation error bardblf − P V T f bardbl decreases. The Strang–Fix conditions [12] relate the approximation power of the representation to the spectral characteristics of the generating function: bardblf − P V T f bardbllessorequalslantC L T L bardblf (L) bardbl, ∀f ∈ W L 2 , where C L is a known constant and bardblf (L) bardbl= parenleftBigg 1 2π ∞ integraldisplay −∞ w 2L vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ f(w) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 parenrightBigg 1/2 . Here, W L 2 denotes the space of functions that are L times differentiable in the L 2 or finite- energy sense, and P V T f , as before, the orthogonal projection of f into V T . The error will decay like O(T L ), where the order of approximation is L = n + 1, and n the polyno- mial degree. Spline interpolation gives an identical error of approximation but a larger C L constant [13,14]. In our case, the spaces V ϕ ⊂ L 2 formed from the M i are all disjoint (the constant func- tion is not in L 2 ). Hence, they do not intersect and are not a subset of each other (for example, we cannot say that V M 1 ⊂ V M 2 or vice-versa). For ϕ 1 we have that ϕ 1 (t) = M 1 (t), that is, the spaces generated from the translations set of ϕ 1 and M 1 are equivalent, i.e., V ϕ 1 ≡ V M 1 . Now, suppose that ψ(t)= αM 3 (t) + βM 4 (t), for some fixed reals α and β. Suppose that for these values of α and β the Riesz bounds are better for V ψ than for V M 3 and V M 4 . Consider the projection of a signal f ∈ L 2 in V M 3 , V M 4 , and V ψ . Controlling T leads to approximations as good as necessary, but the representation in V ψ will remain the most stable. This is also the case when α = 4 and β =−3, that is, the approximation of a signal f ∈ L 2 will be numerically better in V ϕ 2 than in V M 3 or V M 4 . 234 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 A similar argument can be applied to the representations produced by the projections into V ϕ 6 , which are found to be more stable than the ones in V M 2 and V M 4 .Thesameis true for V ϕ 7 , in this case with respect to V M 4 and V M 5 . 5. The dual bases To complete this study, and in reference to Fig. 1, it remains to describe the dual func- tions of the interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 . For the B-splines, and according to (1), we find ˆ M ◦ 1 (w) = 2sin w 2 w , ˆ M ◦ 2 (w) = 12(1 − cos 2 w 2 ) w 2 (1 + 2 cos 2 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 3 (w) = 120 sin w 2 (1 − cos 2 w 2 ) w 3 (2 + 11 cos 2 w 2 + 2 cos 4 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 4 (w) = 5040(1 − 2 cos 2 w 2 + cos 4 w 2 ) w 4 (17 + 180 cos 2 w 2 + 114 cos 4 w 2 + 4 cos 6 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 5 (w) = 90720 sin w 2 (1 − 2 cos 2 w 2 + cos 4 w 2 ) w 5 (62 + 1072 cos 2 w 2 + 1452 cos 4 w 2 + 247 cos 6 w 2 + 7 cos 8 w 2 ) . (14) See Fig. 5 for plots. As for the interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 we find Fig. 5.

(15) See Fig. 6. The expressions (14) and (15) define the frequency response of each analysis filter, or pre-filter, completing the framework of Fig. 1. 6. Conclusions For all practical purposes, signal representation procedures must be stable under small perturbations in the input data, and sometimes it is also desirable that the support of the interpolating kernel be as small as possible. This limits the truncation error, since only a 236 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 few coefficients contribute to the representation at any given point. The kernels that have been discussed meet both conditions. In the context of the sampling scheme described in [7], certain linear combinations of B-splines, already studied in a different context [9], lead to representations with tighter Riesz bounds than those generated by B-splines alone. Numerically, they therefore lead to more stable representations. References [1] C. de Boor, A Practical Guide to Splines, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978. [2] M.

Because for a human operator this is a time consuming and error prone task, a computer vision system has been set up to improve the process. The task of measuring the leaf presents no major problems, while counting the number of teeth and secondary veins has proved to be complex at the resolutions used. This paper describes the state of the project, going into some detail on the algorithms. A complete system has been assembled, based on an PC connected to an imaging system. A windows-based application has been developed, which integrates the control of the operations to grab, store and analyze images of different varieties of chestnut-tree leaves in an organized way. Because the accuracy of the computer vision algorithms used is not sufficient for the system to be completely autonomous, a semi-automatic solution has been adopted. The operator validates or corrects the results of the automatic analysis. This solution leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the human operator, both in terms of speed and quality of the results.",
