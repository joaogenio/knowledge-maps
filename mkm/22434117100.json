Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the European Mediterranean region, rural fires are a widely known problem that cause serious socio-economic losses and undesirable environmental consequences, including the loss of lives, infrastructures, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the provisioning of raw materials. In the last decades, the collapse of the traditional rural socioeconomic systems that once characterized the Mediterranean region, along with land-use changes, have created conflicts and additional driving factors for rural fires. Within Europe, Portugal is the most affected country by rural fires. This work intends to demonstrate the importance of recovering and valorizing residual agroforestry biomass to reduce rural fire risk in Portugal, and thus contributing to a fire resilient landscape. From the results of the known causes of fires in Portugal, it becomes very clear that it is crucial to educate people to end risky behaviors, such as the burning of agroforestry leftovers that causes 27% of fires in Portugal each year. The valorization of the existing energy potential in the lignocellulosic biomass of agroforestry residues favors the reduction of the probability of rural fires, this being the focus of the project BioAgroFloRes—Sustainable Supply Chain Model for Residual Agroforestry Biomass supported in a Web Platform—introduced and explained here.",

The aim of this paper is to propose an innovative web platform to increase knowledge transfer among all stakeholders involved in accessible tourism. To achieve this aim, a content analysis of a sample of web platforms responsible for promoting accessible tourism was conducted. With the limitations of the existing platforms as a reference and using a triangulation of methods to identify the requirements that a web platform for accessible tourism should include, a new platform is presented. It is characterized by being innovative and by promoting the collaboration and sharing of information between all the actors involved in accessible tourism—access@tour by action. The analysis revealed that there is a lack of this type of platform: only 10 platforms promoting accessible tourism were identified. Moreover, these platforms are limited in scope. Therefore, new tools should be developed to increase the participation of people with special needs in tourism activities, especially people with disabilities.",

However, people with special needs face various constraints in accessing tourism products. The absence of accessible information is one of the main barriers that people with special needs face when they intend to travel. The Internet represents one of the most important information sources in tourism. However, a limited number of studies examine the use of the Internet in the accessible tourism market, specifically website accessibility. To extend knowledge in this field, this study aims to analyse the website accessibility of hotels and Pousadas de Portugal located in the Central Region of Portugal. A sample of 306 websites was analysed based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, using automatic web diagnostic tools (AccessMonitor and TAW). This analysis was performed considering the A, AA and AAA conformance levels of WCAG. Findings reveal that the web accessibility level of the hotels analysed is low, with the ‘Perceivable’ and ‘Robust’ guidelines being the most critical. Moreover, there are differences in the web accessibility levels in terms of hotel category. Contrary to what was expected, the higher category hotels present the lowest level of web accessibility. These results can help hotel managers and web designers to improve communication with an important growth market – accessible tourism.",

Therefore, a positive attitude toward knowledge sharing is required. Considering that the knowledge-sharing attitude is motivated and executed mainly at the individual level, this study aims to examine the relationship between individual factors and the attitude toward knowledge sharing among professors and researchers. Design/methodology/approach: Data was obtained from 176 completed questionnaires collected through LimeSurvey system. The analysis is based on quantitative methods where descriptive and inferential statistics were used. This study investigated the individual factors that affect attitude toward knowledge sharing among professors and researchers of a HEI. Findings: The results identified that intrinsic motivation was the factor that most positively affects knowledge-sharing attitude. Given that intrinsic motivation is an activity moved by self-determination, and is free of external pressures or rewards, the finding may be related to the inviolable values, such as freedom and autonomy, existing in this context. Consistent with the concept of extrinsic motivation as a controlled motivation, this factor was not identified as affecting attitude toward knowledge sharing. Networking was the other factor that positively affects attitude on this institution. Originality/value: In practice, this work can help the institution in defining strategies and developing future actions to promote a knowledge-sharing culture supported through an empirical study. In a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the knowledge increase in the area, as little is known about the attitudes regarding knowledge sharing in HEIs.",

Nevertheless, the literature is lacking a broader comprehension of the Smart City barriers to enable policymakers to design and execute their strategies. Therefore, this paper aims to find the (critical) barriers that have been associated with having a significant influence on the success of a Smart City’s implementation and that are within the control of policymakers, based on the empirical knowledge and experience of experts. A study of the temporal aspect in which they can be overcome is also performed to allow better planning. Moreover, 50 barriers were aggregated and organized in eight distinct areas from a thematic analysis of an initial list of 114 barriers collected from the literature. Nine experts participated in the Delphi Analysis, which demonstrated that although Smart Cities are usually associated with technological and financial constraints, the 15 most critical barriers are mainly from the areas of Governance, Project, and Organization. The method combined a two-round survey with a focus group, using quantitative and qualitative approaches.",

Previous research suggests that one reason explaining the success of DMSs is the ability to engage destination-based players in adopting these systems and in using its functionalities. Nevertheless, there is almost no research on factors explaining the importance that destination-based stakeholders assign to specific functionalities typically found in DMSs, neither on the factors that influence that importance. This research is especially important to design more useful DMSs and promote the use of these platforms. The present paper examines the factors influencing the relevance that stakeholders assign to several DMSs’ functionalities. The empirical study was performed in a Portuguese region–the NUTS II Center of Portugal. Results indicate that the importance given by stakeholders to DMSs’ functionalities is influenced by factors such as their perceptions on the destination’s readiness to adopt these systems, the perceived usefulness of DMSs and, in some cases, by the resources and strategic vision of their own organization, type of respondent, the stakeholders’ knowledge on DMOs’ platforms and affiliation to DMOs. However, the impact of the previously mentioned factors differs according to the kind of functionalities considered.",

Smart Cities are replacing the short-time perspective with a long-term approach. The objectives align with city strategic goals, and citizens play an essential role in the decision-making process. High-level guidelines have emerged over the years to guide Smart Cities' vision and implementation. However, the lack of a tool that combines top-down and bottom-up approaches to help local policymakers plan and assess cities is still notorious. Moreover, this paper provides a methodology that allows the definition of structural priorities and contextual preferences while comparing policymakers' statements and citizens' opinions. Furthermore, this paper designs an approach to fill the existing gap and give policymakers a framework to monitor and measure their performance based on standard Key Performance Indicators and select relevant initiatives toward meeting the defined goals. This way, policymakers possess a tool that allows on the one hand, the standard comparison between cities and, on the other hand, the personalized comparison of their territory over time. Finally, a test case with the premise of improving city logistics is described to practically detail the guidelines of the proposed tool'.",

Social organisations (SO) are potential mediators between the tourism industry and this market, especially for reducing barriers to participation. However, there is a lack of research on the role these organisations perform as facilitators of access to leisure and tourism. This paper aims to identify the difficulties faced and strategies adopted by SO when developing recreation and tourism activities, as well as the benefits of these activities for PwSN. A qualitative approach was adopted, namely semi-structured interviews with representatives of Portuguese SO working with PwSN. The findings highlight that Portuguese SO have had a dynamic and proactive behaviour in the development of recreation and tourism activities, contributing to increased access of PwSN to tourism activities, especially for people belonging to socially and economically disadvantaged groups. However, the results also show that SO face several constraints, specifically financial constraints, lack of specialised human resources and the lack of suitable tourism supply (e.g. accommodation, transportation) for this market. The paper ends with strategies that these organisations may adopt to cope with these constraints.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The lack of examples of smart-city initiatives and the sharing of best practices in Portugal confirm the gap in the transference of empirical knowledge to the scientific literature in this area. The smart-city concept has passed through three stages. However, its evolution has not been noted equally throughout countries and their territories. The literature only provides information about specific projects implemented in a few cities. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to study the state-of-the-art of smart cities in Portugal by analyzing 25 editions of the most relevant national-wide smart-cities magazine. First, the objective of analyzing the magazine was to study each Portuguese city in terms of the subject areas and types of existing initiatives in order, ultimately, to frame cities within their respective smart-city phases, as per the literature. Second, the aim of the paper was also to provide information about the evolution of the concept through analyses of embedded experts’ quotes. The results of the first are complemented with the analysis of interviews with policymakers to provide information about the existing challenges to implementing a smart city and to understand the role of government therein. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on the case study. The findings suggest that the three smart-city phases are perceived in slightly different ways in Portugal and heterogeneity within the country can be noted from the lack of strategies and a standard framework.",

Fig 7 Table 1 Brief characterization of the parties involved: BeeVeryCreative, LUGGit and EMBERS. Table 1 Entity Description BeeVeryCreative (Personalized Manufacturing) BeeVeryCreative was the first Portuguese company to build a 3D printer. The company sells printers and pieces to other manufacturers.The mindset has always been and continues to be the open-source and close collaboration between the various players in the market. The strategy is varied. The ability to develop new printers has been put at the service of innovation projects in which the main concern is not economic viability, but rather the disruption in a given sector with patenting and creating intellectual property. This also comes with the willingness to openly dispose of IPs at the service of the community. BeeVeryCreative started with the home-user segment, education and third-party manufacturers. In recent years, they have entered in the industry and space (with projects for the International Space Station) markets. Furthermore, the company is currently carrying out a project for skin printing (the largest and most personalized organ) with a very interesting survival rate of living cells. LUGGit (Personalized Logistics) LUGGit's vision is to allow everyone to travel without carrying their luggage. Moreover, LUGGit is a platform that allows anyone to request a Keeper (driver) in real-time to pick up their luggage and deliver it at the place and time they choose.Through a revenue-sharing model (the drivers act as service providers) the service can be performed in real-time or be scheduled (in advance). Unlike other carriers, LUGGit's algorithm has the premise of setting the exact time on which the client wants the delivery to happen. The optimization rule is always according to the chosen delivery time and not according to the location of the delivery.The operators at LUGGit are entities that have drivers, vehicles and storage warehouses. They can perform multiple collections, store for the desired time and deliver at the time the client wishes. EMBERS (Aggregated Platform) EMBERS was an EU-funded project under the Horizon 2020 program, which developed an aggregated, harmonized, standardized open-data mobility platform where everyone could access the city's data and their mobility services from different operators.Through a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, the information about existing mobility services was aggregated and made available to citizens. This way, users could move smoothly from point A (start) to point B (end), without the discomfort of having to buy tickets from multiple vendors, wait in queues, or visit various platforms to coordinate transportation.EMBERS goal was to help cities break existing silos (proprietary solutions). EMBERS was responsible for aggregating mobility-related data, including parks and parking spaces, maps, route generators, points of interest, traffic, which would serve as the basis for third-party applications.

Keywords Last-mile-as-a-service Industry 4.0 Smart cities Smart logistics Smart manufacturing Smart supply chain 1 Introduction How many times did a client purchase a standard product because it was not possible to personalize it? How many times did a client order a product from the other side of the world based on price and it took months to be delivered? In the current technological context and in an era characterized by digitalization, these questions highlight an inefficiency on the supply chain performance where both companies and consumers are jeopardized. Over and above that, the environment is negatively impacted. Moreover, the collaboration and sharing of resources between agents is essential to provide a personalized service to consumers and combat climate change. Nevertheless, if a client wants to purchase a product from a distant market, this action still represents a significant logistics effort, with the need to combine multiple urban and transcontinental modes of transportation to deliver the product to its final destination. Mass production has so far justified resorting to manufacturing in third-world countries, often extremely far away, derived from the cheap cost of production and labor. However, personalization and small-scale production are increasingly disabling the rationale for mass production and standard supply chains. In 2050, around 70% of population will live in cities and neighboring regions United Nations (2015). Urban and freight logistics are some of the most heavy-duty activities in terms of consumer resources and greenhouse gas emissions, challenging cities’ sustainability (Bibri & Krogstie, 2017). With Green Deal, the European Commission has the ambition of achieving carbon neutrality in the European Union by 2050. Sustainable Industry and Sustainable Mobility are within the Green Deal's scope. Moreover, two of the Green Deal goals strive towards sustainable and smart mobility, thus pushing the industry to a clean and circular economy European Commission (2019). Recent events such as the Covid-19 1 1 The COVID-19 is the global pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease that emerged in 2019. vaccine distribution issues and the blockage of the Ever Given ship in the Suez Canal 2 2 Ever Given ship blocked the Suez Canal in March 2021 over 6 days which had a significant impact on global economy. raised concerns about the need for a global collaboration and knowledge sharing for local fulfillment. The Covid-19 pandemic also accelerated the necessity to re-think cities. The need to assist citizens with closer public services was noted by Moreno et. al (2021), who proposed a “15-minute city” conceptual approach to help policymakers plan cities towards the availability of essentials and basic needs, by foot or bicycle, promoting citizens' quality of life and avoiding the need to use the car. Furthermore, this concept may also be applied to the delivery of goods to citizens, breaking down the supply chain, reducing the circulating vehicles and their travelled distances, boiling down manufacturing and logistics activities to the last-mile. Industry 4.0 is striving to base manufacturing on predictive analytics and the integration of the entire service from ideation and design to the delivery (Laplume, Petersen, & Pearce, 2016). 3D printing will allow companies to become more responsive to personalized requirements and enable production to be performed elsewhere (Kang et al., 2016). Digital transformation in the supply chain enables sharing data between actors and real-time data analysis, breaking away from organizational silos, creating common goals, and increasing collaboration and communication. The path to a more sustainable supply chain involves transitioning to a circular model where additive manufacturing plays an important role, and all agents and individuals in the chain are integrated and can collaborate with each other. Korczak & Kijewska (2019) noticed that the term “Smart Logistics” emerged at the beginning of the 21st century and was known as decentralizing decision-making to local systems. Furthermore, it was also associated to the capacity of planning and control logistics processes from the data gathered with the tracking and identification of elements until the detection of the problem, choice, and automatic execution of the solution (McFarlane, Giannikas, & Lu, 2016). Moreover, logistics platforms help in a cost-effective way to design, plan, implement and control the forward and reverse flow of goods from the origin point to the destination, guaranteeing resource efficiency, security of goods, sustainability and on-time distribution (Jabeur, Al-Belushi, Mbarki, & Gharrad, 2017). Barenji, Wang, Li and Guerra-Zubiaga (2019) proposed a multi agent-based platform to control and facilitate decision-making and the information exchange between end users, suppliers and the distribution center. Several authors conceptualized multiple collaborative frameworks to enable the collaboration between logistics stakeholders and individuals (Rožman, Vrabič, Corn, Požrl, & Diaci, 2019; Xu, Zheng, & Yu, 2018). However, these platforms and their related research are focused on distribution optimization and stock management, leaving aside the transfer of manufacturing and the focus on the last-mile fulfilment. Moreover, the literature lacks a broader comprehension on the impact of local collaborations for all aspects of the supply chain rather than just the logistical optimization of freight distribution and last-mile deliveries. Furthermore, there is a gap on the provision of an end-to-end framework where manufacturing, storage and delivery are personalized, and the global supply chain is open and built upon the requirements of the client. For this purpose, this article embraces the existing literature and enunciates an empirical case study to set the foundations and present an emergent model for last-mile optimization and fulfillment, named Last-Mile-as-a-Service (LMaaS). This innovative concept for the disruption of the supply chain relies on the collaboration and integration of assets and management capabilities of different entities to provide any company with a physical and virtual infrastructure capable of providing personalized products and delivery services to their clients at any location. The following section performs a review of the literature about the topis of Industry 4.0 and 3D printing as well as smart supply chain and last-mile. Section 3 proposes a two-steps methodology. Moreover, it details the current challenge and proposes an example of local collaboration to provide a personalized supply chain. The findings of the methodology procedure base the innovative concept proposed in Section 4. Lastly, conclusions and avenues for future research are presented. 2 Theoretical background This literature review chapter gives a brief explanation of the fundamentals of the Industry 4.0 concept and the current state of 3D printing, and explores the background on the supply chain management and last-mile fulfillment. Ultimately, the research findings are resumed, and the existing gap highlighted. The databases used for this research were Scopus and Web of Science. The search keywords were: Industry 4.0, 3D Printing, Last-mile, Smart Manufacturing, Smart Logistics, Smart Supply Chain, Logistics Platforms and Supply Chain Platforms. 2.1 Industry 4.0 and 3D printing The consumers' ongoing desire to participate is pushing the mass customization of the third industrial revolution to a personalized production model (Bortolini, Ferrari, Gamberi, Pilati, & Faccio, 2017), with flexible manufacturing of small series (up to one sample) to respond to individual preferences (Hozdić, 2015; Prause, 2016). Industry 4.0 (or Smart Manufacturing) aims to integrate and take advantage of advanced technologies and information to collect real-time data from the supply chain, thus enabling a rapid and flexible response at different levels to meet the clients’ needs in a highly dynamic and global market (Lu & Ju, 2017). Therefore, there is an increasing need for big data analytics (machine learning and predictive analytics), enabling timely and accurate insights to assist decision-making (Shin, Woo, & Rachuri, 2014). Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and system integration (across all departments and parts of the process) are vital aspects to enable a flexible control production (and its constant changes) in real-time with the concern to the efficient usage of energy and resources, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions, maximizing sustainability, health, and safety (Kang et al., 2016). The decentralization of operations will permit facing unforeseen changing conditions. The integration of the horizontal (across stakeholders) and vertical (across organizational levels) axes will improve the efficiency of the supply chain (Erol, Jäger, Hold, Ott, & Sihn, 2016). Planning and scheduling can be fully integrated with operations featuring coordination and optimization models across the supply chain (Kang et al. 2016). Industry 4.0 is characterized by the fusion of the physical and virtual worlds (Kagermann, Wahlster, & Helbig, 2013), where the product will control production (Nick, Pongrácz, & Radács, 2018). Smart manufacturing revolves around a demand-driven, client-focused, and highly-optimized supply chain (O'Donovan, Leahy, Bruton, & O'Sullivan, 2015). The realization of the Industry 4.0 may also be connected to the evolution of 3D printing. Moreover, several authors argue that 3D printing will lead to a new paradigm with a promising strategy in the one-of-a-kind products possible (Lipson & Kurman, 2013; Moilanen & Vadén, 2013). Historically known as Additive Manufacturing (AM), 3D printing emerged in the 1970s and differs from Subtractive Manufacturing (SM) in the ability of building a product layer-to-layer instead of starting with a block material and removing the unnecessary material to build the final piece (Laplume et al., 2016). Thus, this technological driver of Industry 4.0 is seen as a way to achieve sustainable production — by improving resource efficiency, extending and reconfiguring value chains Ford & Despeisse (2016) — enabling personalization with shorter cycle-times and lower costs (Wang, Ma, Yang, & Wang, 2017). This can potentially have a great impact on the supply chain and society (Chen, Pan, & Ouyang, 2014; Taniguchi, Thompson, & Yamada, 2016). The large dimension printers, which could cost up to 300,000 USD, have evolved to affordable open-source home printers in the early years of the 21st century (Bradshaw, Bowyer, & Haufe, 2010). From rapid prototyping and tooling, to the medical sector, the applications of 3D printing have spread throughout multiple areas. Laplume, Petersen & Pearce (2016) present a background of 3D printing where the evolution of the printer and their methods are studied, and a reflection on the impact of this technology may have on the supply chain and society is put forward. Moreover, 3D printing brings companies’ the ability to become more responsive, as production is brought closer to the client, reducing the lead time, ensuring the client's fundamental wishes and the planet's sustainability (Paritala, Manchikatla, & Yarlagadda, 2017). 2.2 Supply chain and the last-mile The supply chain is becoming vertically connected. Thus, it is striving to the point of managing and delivering orders in real-time (Oztemel & Gursev, 2020). New business models are emerging due to the infinite opportunities presented by emergent technologies and the interoperability between systems Prause (2016). Win-win business collaboration schemes are being increasingly considered to optimize urban transport (Nathanail, Gogas, & Adamos, 2016). Moreover, the supply chain is evolving into a shared-economy open cross-company network (Kirch, Poenicke, & Richter, 2017). Based on the interconnection of systems, there is a possibility of creating an effective demand-oriented manufacturing process (Lom, Pribyl, & Miroslav Svitek, 2016). Thus, the embracement of networked manufacturing, adaptive logistics, and client co-design will render the value chain more complex, open, collective, and evolutionary Prause (2016). Therefore, last-minute and individual demand emerge the importance of defining new dynamic business models (Kagermann et al., 2013), embracing cooperation and integration among all stakeholders. There will be a promotion of global connection and understanding between individuals and agents of different locations and sectors through the supply chain (Oztemel & Gursev, 2020). On the other hand, co-modality (or crowd shipping) can offer limitless combinations of transport modes (Gatta, Marcucci, Nigro, Patella, & Serafini, 2018) that can be fully dedicated to goods transportation or allocated simultaneously to other tasks, mostly passenger transportation, due to their underutilized capacity space (E Taniguchi & Thompson, 2014). Co-modality also presents the opportunity of replacing intermediaries warehouses with virtual exchanging points Ducret (2014). Lost packages, failure to deliver on time, sorting out parcels, misalignment of drivers and deliveries, and lack of interaction due to the inability to link and connect the different stakeholders compromise efficiency and flexibility of deliveries (Perboli, Rosano, Saint-Guillain, & Rizzo, 2018). E-commerce, especially in the case of business-to-consumer (B2C) increases the difficulty of product distribution with direct impact on traffic congestion and accessibility as well as environmental pollution and climate change (Ducret, 2014; Morganti, Dablanc, & Fortin, 2014). Nevertheless, it lacks a holistic perspective regarding the product journey since clients perceive the experience and the actors involved as one (Vakulenko, Shams, Hellström, & Hjort, 2019). The tracking is still not performed in real-time, neither there is information about the exact lead-time. The empirical study performed by Cao, Ajjan & Hong (2018) of online shoppers in China and Taiwan concludes that shipment and order tracking play a relevant role in online shopping. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce over the past 20 years has created an increased need for a responsive omnichannel distribution to meet the last-mile challenge (Melacini, Perotti, Rasini, & Tappia, 2018). The “last-mile” term emerged from the telecommunications industry to name the final leg of a network. Applied to the supply chain, it refers to the last segment of the delivery process from the last distribution center, consolidation point, or local warehouse (Xiao, Wang, Lenzer, & Sun, 2017). Synonyms such as final-mile, home-delivery, B2C distribution, and grocery delivery have also been found in the literature (Lim, Jin, & Srai, 2018). Last-mile is considered in academia as the least efficient supply chain stage, comprising 28% of the total delivery cost ( Wang, Zhang, Liu, Shen, & Lee, 2016), and the least environmentally-friendly (Gevaers, Voorde, & Vanelslander, 2011). A literature review carried out about last-mile logistics in smart cities and urban areas considered collaborative urban logistics and optimization of transport management and routing as the main innovations to reduce transport costs and inefficiency (Ranieri, Digiesi, Silvestri, & Roccotelli, 2018). Transport systems will increasingly be flexible and multi-modal (Prause & Atari, 2017). Several authors refer to the advantages of having a simultaneous and integrated approach between home delivery and client's pick-up (Zhou, Baldacci, Vigo, & Wang, 2018; Zhou, Wang, Ni, & Lin, 2016). Furthermore, large firms, including Amazon and UPS, are increasingly investing in the ridesharing service model's adaptation, where an entity procures transportation services via a mobile or computer application. The services are performed by independent contractors using a personally owned vehicle (Boysen, Fedtke, & Schwerdfeger, 2020; Castillo, 2018; Savelsbergh & Van Woensel, 2016). 2.3 Research findings From the literature review, it is possible to conclude that although deliveries are striving for the real-time model, promoting the collaboration of different stakeholders and transportation means, at the same time that 3D printers are becoming available for households, there is not yet a concept nor a framework capable of bridging them and providing an open and harmonized solution to breakdown the standard supply chain, thus allowing the open collaboration between stakeholders and effectively bringing the manufacturing process closer to the client. Therefore, in line with the above-mentioned gap, this article aims to conceptualize a supply chain service model based on the personalized fulfilment of the last-mile considering local and dynamic collaborations. Thus, the research challenge underlying this study seeks to answer the question “How can a consumer purchase a personalized product at any part of the globe and have it in (almost) real-time?”. 3 Empirical research The solution to answer the previous mentioned research question will need to be based on an end-to-end real-time revenue-sharing service, at the disposal of consumers and enterprises, that integrates different modes of transportation, storage warehouses and manufacturing assets. There are already entities that carry out steps of the process. However, they act in isolation and without coordination. The methodology chosen to carry out this study aims to simulate the existing problem and perform empirical research to identify local organizations that could support the theory that the combination of these type of entities would enable local manufacturing and delivery in real time with minimal environmental impact. The goal was not to base this research in a large-sized city location but to test the possibility of proposing a collaboration between already established companies from a small random city to provide a personalized service than it would likely be possible to extend it globally. Therefore, the corroboration of this theory for a small-sized city allows for the last step of the methodology to define a disruptive global concept. 3.1 Method design The methodology followed in this research, sketched in Fig. 1 , was divided in two steps: A) Simulation of the problem and B) Design of a local solution, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. A) Simulation of the problem - To highlight the existing problem in a real context, an empirical study was conducted; its purpose was to simulate a purchase of a product from a distant location from Portugal (in this case, China). Alibaba was used for the search because it is a platform that directly links (mostly) Chinese manufacturers to consumers, allowing them to give a production order when purchasing, according to the desired quantity. To collect data for this simulation, the product sought was “Plastic Toy”. The data about the costs and time of execution and delivery of the first 50 results were collected. The goal of this sub-section was to quantify the existing problem to compare it in sub-section B with the local collaboration proposed. B) Design of a local solution - To demonstrate the possibility to locally achieve a personalized and real-time response to any purchase, an empirical search in a city of Portugal (9,000 kilometers away from China) was carried out, looking for local stakeholders whose characteristics could provide the production of any personalized item as well as its delivery. Moreover, the city of Aveiro was chosen since it is a small city located in the center of Portugal, between the two metropolitan regions (Lisbon and Porto). A case study was performed to get a more in-depth insight about the local chosen entities. This research method examines complex phenomenon and intensively studies a subject with the goal of generalizing it to a broader perspective Gustafsson (2017). Moreover, the case study was based on structured interviews with privileged interlocutors of each organization where the topics explored went through the content of the organization's activity, their vision about their company and the collaboration with other companies to provide an integrated and personalized service, complemented by the analysis of documents (such as business plans, R&D proposals, and whitepapers) gently provided by the organizations. In summary, three structured interviews (adapted to each interviewee's activity) with C-level professionals and project managers were carried out. In general terms, the questions which based the interviews were: “What is the history of the company, its purpose and vision?”; “Is it (and how is it) possible to leverage your expertise to any part of the globe?”; “What are the requirements and limitations of your product/service?”; “What are the estimated costs and time?”; “What is your openness to integrate with other solutions and provide an end-to-end service?”. The overall goal was to understand the cost and time to manufacture and deliver a product in real-time within the last-mile, considering the collaboration of these entities. The results of the comparison between standard and personalized supply chains feed the discussion and ground the rationale for the model proposed in Section 4. 3.2 Procedure and results This sub-section details the undertaken procedure of the method design mentioned above. Moreover, on one side, Step A simulates the existing problem of traditional supply chains to perform real-time personalized requests. On the other side, Step B set up a solution that combines different local entities and compares it with Step A's results. 3.2.1 Step A: Simulation of the problem From a sample of 50 products in Alibaba, the minimum quantity order was selected, and data were collected regarding the price of the product, its shipping cost, as well as the lead time and shipping time. From the results obtained (Annex 1) it is possible to notice that: i Only 7 products allowed for a single unit order; ii The average lead time is 11.52 days; iii The average minimum delivery time (average of the lower interval values) is 12.82 days; iv The average maximum delivery time (average of the upper interval values) is 19.94 days; v The average unit price is 5.06 USD; vi The average unit shipping price is 14.99 USD, representing a percentage of 296.4% of the product price; Thus, for a “Plastic Toy” ordered in Alibaba, from China, it would take more than 32 days to be delivered to a client in Portugal, its cost averaging more than 20 USD. If the production would be carried out by a local 3D printer, it would use less raw material to produce the same product and the lead time would be lower. Also, it would allow the personalization of the product, unlike in the mentioned purhcase platform , given the inherent standardization focus. In summary, it is noted that the traditional supply chain does not fit the needs of personalized requirements. 3.2.2 Step B: Design of a local solution Based on the authors’ search, the following organizations were identified based on the problem they address, which could contribute to organize a personalized response to local consumer's requests. The openness to collaborate and promote a sustainable solution to eradicate unnecessary emissions, waste and the inefficiency throughout the supply chain was unanimous among the interviewees. The content collected from the three structured interviews and the documents’ analysis of BeeVeryCreative (2021), LUGGit (2021) and EMBERS (2019) is detailed in Table 1 . The empirical case study shows that BeeVeryCreative provides 3D printers (and components) that allow personalized manufacturing; LUGGit showcases how the service's personalization can be combined with logistics efficiency and the role of independent service providers to perform it, within the last-mile, and EMBERS provides a harmonized platform, as a service, open to all stakeholders and resources. In a nutshell, their best practices and interrelationship in the present solution can be resumed as demonstrated in Figure 2 (below). Considering the characteristics and complementarity of the contributions of each entity involved, the high-level architecture of the solution is defined and represented in Fig. 3 . To compare the results obtained in sub-section A, during the interviews, the interlocutors of BeeVeryCreative and LUGGit were asked about the estimated cost and manufacture and delivery times, respectively, within the city of Aveiro, for the same type of “Plastic Toy” used in the Alibaba search. BeeVeryCreative has 400 USD printers that could produce it in half of day with an average total cost of 20 USD considering labor, materials and other costs; LUGGit has drivers which could perform the service from any location in the city to the delivery destination in real-time for an average price of 15 USD. Moreover, Fig. 4 compares the previous empirical example obtained from the Alibaba platform and the solution provided by the combination of the mentioned entities. As it is demonstrated in Fig. 4, the overall lead time of the traditional supply chain was decreased by 98% considering the proposed collaboration of the three entities in this sub-section. From the interviews, it is clear that there will be no limits to what can be achieved by combining 3D printing with real-time logistical capacity and the integration of all stakeholders. However, it was also possible to note that personalized manufacturing is still not competitive for those who do not mind waiting several days to receive their purchases. Moreover, the estimated cost is approximately 74% higher in the proposed model. Nevertheless, 3D printing evolution is expected to decrease manufacturing costs and reduce the lead time. Furthermore, only the designed solution allows the personalization of the product and real-time delivery. The combination of the entities of the case study would allow same-day production and delivery of one of the products that based the sample for sub-section A, requiring only a BeeVeryCreative 3D printer and one LUGGit operator to respectively manufacture and deliver it according to the requirements. Furthermore, all this could be integrated into a single platform and charged as a service depending on the resources used, as well as the distance travelled from the manufacturing facilities to the delivery location, as well as time spent. Based on the findings from the combination of the entities from a small Portuguese city, Aveiro, it is recommended that further efforts are put into place to scale and globally adopt this model. 4 Proposed framework The main results of this study, described in this section, are presented and discussed according to the steps of the methodology previously outlined. In sub-section A, the results from the simulation of the problem to highlight the existing gap of the traditional supply chain are presented. Following this, on sub-section B, a study from the empirical search and the performed interviews to base a local collaboration to ultimately compare and discuss the standard and personalized supply chain results will be developed. Lastly, this section presents the concept of Last-Mile-as-a-Service (LMaaS) based on the results of the empirical research. From the comparing results and the generalization of the designed local combined solution in sub-section B, a reflection about the future of the supply chain setup and fulfillment emerges. The relocation of the manufacturing process to the last-mile may eliminate a significant part of the traditional supply chain. The combination of all entities and individuals throughout the globe would allow a new industrial paradigm where the location of the clients would be the input to combine the local entities to manufacture and delivery the product quickly and sustainably. Moreover, any entity could resort to the last-mile created by the combination of the three mentioned entities to provide a product to be delivered to a client in the city of Aveiro. However, others could assure the fulfillment of the last-mile for purchases of clients located in different Portuguese city. Thus, this could be extended to any region. In general terms, this model will allow endless combinations between entities and individuals to meet the personalized requirements of any client anywhere in the globe. Therefore, a Last-Mile-as-a-Service (LMaaS) should emerge, where stakeholders with delivery, storage and manufacturing capabilities are integrated to perform an end-to-end service within the last-mile. The empirical case study of the previous section can ground this global model that promotes and makes available an open resource-sharing platform based on a marketplace of last-mile collaborations that enables any company to allow their products and services to be personalized and delivered to any location through the cooperation of local stakeholders (Fig. 5 below). This model suits the interests of the clients by allowing them to choose the exact requirements for product and delivery service. The marketplace shall contemplate the transparent and open collaboration between stakeholders, fostered by a single platform to find the best combination of means to perform the last-mile for a specific request. Table 2 (below) highlights and compares the relevant features of BeeVeryCreative, LUGGit, EMBERS to ultimately aggregat them,thus forming the foundations of the LMaaS. The indicated features in Table 1 were based on the relationship between each of the entities' most significant attributes, and the mentioned gap in the Introduction and the Theoretical Background about the lack of an open and end-to-end integrated and personalized supply chain based on the dynamic collaboration of multiple and local stakeholders. Last-mile collaborations will dynamically change, since this concept (LMaaS) is based on a marketplace where individuals or entities can provide their assets so they can be made available to any company that wants to sell (manufacture) their products in a given location. The specific collaboration to each purchase will consist of the best available options capable of responding to the client's requirements of the product and service. Different people can perform the collection of the manufactured goods and the delivery to the client; however, the supply chain needs to be created prior to the manufacturing order. The LMaaS starting point will be dependent on the manufacturing capacity close to the client. A new request will go through the decision journey represented in Fig. 6 (below), where manufacturing only starts after the algorithm has determined that delivery will also be fulfilled based on the requirements of the client. Personalization is characterized by producing what the client wants and delivering it at the desired place and time. To ultimately achieve that and be at all times capable of providing an immediate response is necessary to integrate additive manufacturing techniques with logistics, merging the physical and the cyber layer, enhancing the exchanging of information throughout the value chain from the prediction of the order to manufacturing and its delivery (Correia, Teixeira, & Marques, 2021). Moreover, taking the product specifications, the marketplace will return the most suitable option to manufacturing it (considering the manufacturing process), and combine it with the logistics best options to deliver (and store if needed) the product at the place and time the client chooses. Multiple scenarios and combinations of last-mile fulfillment can be found in Fig. 7 (below). Fig. 7 also acknowledges that standardization and personalization manufacturing processes will continue to coexist. Therefore, the last-mile fulfillment must consider the ability to perform real-time deliveries and enhance the collaboration between stakeholders and modes of transportation, even if it follows the manufacturing of a standard product. In summary, unlike the existing mass production paradigm that has reasonably justified moving the manufacturing process to other countries, with the LMaaS model the collaboration between stakeholders and the associated technologies can represent a significant decrease on emissions and help combat climate change. At the manufacturing level, the needed raw materials can be considerably reduced, up to 100% of the existing waste, and, at the transport level, fewer vehicles will be needed to perform the deliveries and traveled distances will be shortened. Replacing private vehicles with smooth modes of transportation will leverage cities’ footprint towards zero. Thus, this model responds unequivocally to the initial question of this research. 5 Conclusions and future work Industry 4.0 is striving to allow clients to purchase personalized products in terms of their requirements and the associated delivery service. Personalization brings several challenges that can only be overtaken with the integration and sharing of resources among organizations. This paradigm can lead manufacturing in the destination country to be easier and cheaper. Moreover, 3D printers can produce personalized components for the open network and relocate the manufacturing process closer to the client, reducing lead time, transport costs and customs fees, with significant impact on economy, environment and society. Nowadays, if a company wanted to provide an end-to-end personalized service at any location, it would struggle to do it. Based on an empirical study of Alibaba, it was noted that standard supply chains do not present a solution to the research question. After simulating the problem, companies who could provide personalized (and immediate) deliveries and manufacturing were looked for within the local ecosystem. The rationale of the methodology was to choose a small-sized city to study if the collaboration of local companies could be more competitive than the standard mass production supply chain. The corroboration of the theory for the local example would allow a global model to overcome the existing gap and respond to the research question. From the combination of the manufacture assets of BeeVeryCreative, the operational aspect of LUGGit and the open integration promoted by EMBERS it was possible to reduce the overall lead time by 98%. Considering the findings of this empirical study and the technological potential of Industry 4.0, this article proposed an innovative concept for the disruption of the Supply Chain — Last-Mile-as-a-Service (LMaaS), where different modes of transportation, storage, and manufacturing resources can be integrated and managed to allow immediate deliveries and resume the supply chain to the Last-mile fulfillment. LMaaS aims to provide to any entity the chance of allowing the personalization of their products and delivery at any location. The standard supply chain, where manufacturing is performed 10,000 kilometers away from the consumer's location, would cease to exist. The proposal of this disruptive concept to bring the supply chain to the last-mile will allow the breakdown of the traditional supply chain and help combat greenhouse gas emissions in cities caused by urbanization and logistics activities. The number of circulating vehicles and their travelled distances will reduce at the same time that they will be replaced by last-mile smooth modes of transportation. However, this new proximity model, due to its complexity and disruptive nature, can bring some challenges. On the one hand, there is the short-term transition challenge for the reality because the concept is grounded in the culture of sharing and cooperation of enterprises. On the other hand, the associated overall estimated cost is still quite high when compared with the traditional supply chain for the consumer. Additionally, this concept may not be applied to all products. Mass production for various sectors and realities will not cease to be present since it will continue to be more competitive for standard products. Moreover, in the future, there may be a close relationship between additive and subtractive manufacturing, in a hybrid model, to the point where the second serves only as support for the production and maintenance of the first. As future work, the proposed framework shall be validated in practice to measure its impact on the macro and micro economy and provide information about the challenges encountered in the process. In addition, this paper can lead to further conceptual and empirical studies while developing connections with local stakeholders in different regions of the globe to realize the concept in a proof-of-concept prototype. The role of the city can be also further studied. The city can play a catalyst role in the adoption of this concept by putting at the community's disposal the needed resources and materials. The role of society shall be further studied, as well as the impact this concept will have in its organization and labor needs. The supply of the raw materials and equipment components as well as the assembly of larger products must be further studied. Autonomous vehicles (in their various forms) may also bring new challenges and opportunities. Evolving into a system where there is the chance of individuals producing everything at any location, it will also be important to study what will be the role of brands and how they will differentiate themselves.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Industry 4.0 and its application in the business has been the focus of attention by the acad-emy, for its ability to establish principles of flexibility and connectivity along the shop floor. Mean-time, because of a lean wave in the 1990’s, most of the western industry adopted principles, tech-niques and tools of lean production, whose results were quickly captured, guaranteed its adoption worldwide. Thus, with a view to turning traditional manufacturing companies into smart compa-nies, it is essential to preserve the existing system and find ways for the two concepts (Lean and I4.0) to come together. This study was conducted based on a systematic literature review, using the Scopus database. The PRISMA process was the method used to select the articles. Finally, to analyze and discuss the results, the bibliometric analysis of the articles and content analysis were adopted. The results point to a greater impact of I4.0 technologies on lean, since it was perceived that I4.0 technologies give to lean tools a more dynamic way of working, accelerating information sharing processes and improving production manager’s and operator’s decision making. In the perspective of lean’s contribution to I4.0; however, there is little practical and theoretical application, thus the actual contribution is still somewhat blurred.",

The aim of this paper is to examine the view of tourism supply agents (TSA) on the development of an information system for accessible tourism. To achieve this aim, a questionnaire to a sample of Portuguese TSA was administered to identify the type of data that these users are interested in introducing in the system and the information that they desire to obtain from it. Results show that TSA considered the creation of an accessible tourism information system important and also showed interested in being part of it. Regarding the information to insert and retrieve from the tourism information system, TSA showed interest in aspects related to the accessibility of tourism offers, as well as information related to the characteristics of the accessible tourism market.",

Simulataneously, vehicles from different enterprises were still performing similar routes, delivering goods to the same clients or nearby locations, with a small percentage of their capacity filled. The ability to optimize resource usage, re-adjust, and search for alternatives should depend on an integrated real-time decision. Open collaboration between stakeholders in terms of human resources, assets, and data sharing is vital. Industry 4.0 and mostly additive manufacturing can leverage the production closer to the client, eliminating logistic intermediaries' steps, cutting warehouse expenses and delivery costs, and promoting sustainability. Therefore, this paper proposes an adapted framework from the 5W1H (Who, Why, What, Where, When, and How) quality management methodology to organize the supply chain based on the client's personalized inputs and stakeholders' integration.",

The Internet is one of the most used information sources for planning tourism trips. However, the level of accessibility of information disseminated by the tourism industry through websites is still very low. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the existence of diversity in Web accessibility in the tourism industry. METHODS: A systematic literature review method was used for the identification, selection, and evaluation of the published research on Web accessibility in the tourism industry. A set of 40 papers obtained from relevant scientific databases, and complemented with a snowballing effect, was synthesized and analyzed. RESULTS: Low levels of diversity of Web accessibility were found in the different tourism activities analyzed. The majority of studies published in this field are relatively recent and both manual and automated methods were employed. Web accessibility failures were mainly related to lack of connectivity with assistive technologies, complex layout, and navigation difficulties. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this systematic literature review provide important contributions to increase knowledge of Web accessibility in the tourism industry. Moreover, practical and theoretical contributions can help Web developers creating more accessible tourism websites.",

Nowadays, the Industry is striving to allow consumers to buy the product they want, as they wish, and be delivered in the time and place they choose. The purchase personalization and the supply chain’s arrangement to attend to the demand are expected to be increasingly based on predictive analytics. Prediction shall guide the definition of the supply chain. Moreover, the collaboration between stakeholders through an open marketplace is required to fulfill clients’ needs and desires.

Since then the concept has passed from several phases from a purely techno-centric vision to see technology as a means and not an end in itself. Alongside this evolution, the role of citizens has been changing. Nowadays, citizens are seen as taking part in the co-design and co-creation of Smart Cities. However, standard participatory development methodologies are still lacking to guide policymakers. This paper will critically evaluate the role of citizens in smart cities’ governance. Smart City governance can be seen as a specific type of policymaking. Accordingly, knowledge from other disciplines that explore policymaking can be useful in highlighting flaws and future opportunities for smart cities governance. The present work explores this when it comes to the role of citizens in policymaking. It makes use of the knowledge from development geography, and reviews how citizens participation has been understood in smart cities governance. It does so by combining a review of the literature as well as interviews with Portuguese smart cities policymakers. This paper brings these insights together. The results show that while smart city policymakers recognize the importance of including citizens in policymaking, the practical application of this is still very limited. This can be enhanced by using knowledge from development geographies approach to similar problems as well as via the development of tools and guidelines. Future research should explore both of these aspects.",

For this, a user-centered design was followed, putting PwD at the center of the development process. This was obtained by identifying personas and scenarios contributing to a better depiction of the potential users, clearly describing their requirements and accessibility needs. For obtaining the characterization of personas, a comprehensive study in the area of accessible tourism, involving various tourism stakeholders was performed. The methods applied to collect the data were questionnaires, interviews and two focus groups with PwD. Two personas are presented in this article, illustrating the needs and motivations of two groups of PwD. In addition, two scenarios concerning the personas were also elaborated, showing how a technological solution can help the integration in tourism activities.",

This work intends to explore the information requirements that are most valued by higher education institutions in order to conceptualize a Web-based information system which is capable of promoting more accessible tourism conditions for visitors with disabilities (VwD). To achieving this goal, questionnaires were applied to a sample of students and directors of tourism in HEI. Generally speaking, both groups understood the need for a Web platform and also revealed interest in using it. Regarding information to retrieve from the platform, accessible market characteristics and training opportunities were highlighted, while inputs connected to research sharing were the best regarded.

Introduction Haemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), in haemophilia A (HA) or factor IX (FIX), in haemophilia B (HB) [1]. It has a low incidence, affecting the population in a ratio of one case per 10000 people, and thus it is classified as a rare disease [2]. This disease impairs the body's ability to make blood clots and may have very negative consequences for the patient. One of its main symptoms is joint haemorrhage, which if repeated can cause destruction of the cartilage, affecting the entire bone and soft tissue of the joint structure. Thus, people not properly treated can become disabled, with reduced quality of life. The treatment of haemophilia is complex involving highly specialized skills of multidisciplinary teams in specialized centres, known as Comprehensive Haemophilia Treatment Centres (HTCs) [3]. Usually, comprehensive care includes several health team members (e.g. haematologist, physical therapist, nurse, psychosocial expert and social worker) working in collaboration to minimize the negative effects of haemophilia and, consequently, maximizing patientsâ€™ quality of life [1]. There are different types of congenital bleeding disorder (HA, HB, von Willebrand, etc.); however, HA and HB are the most prevalent and are usually classified according their severity, namely: (i) severe - clotting factor level lower than 1% of normal; (ii) moderate - clotting factor level between 1% and 5%; and (iii) mild - clotting factor level between 6% and 40%. Clotting factor concentrate (CFC) is the drug administrated to HA and HB patients to compensate the missing clotting factor in their body. These CFC, either plasmatic (plasma-derived), or recombinant [1], contribute to life improvement of people with haemophilia (PWH), allowing the treatment at home with a high level of independence. Most people with severe haemophilia having conditions for self-infusion are, in fact, on home-therapy [4]. This provides benefits, improving not only theirs but also their familiesâ€™ life quality decreasing the economic impact of this disease likewise. Haemophilia treatment can be done either at home or in the hospital, and both types may follow different protocols: (i) on-demand treatment - at the time of clinically evident bleeding; and (ii) prophylactic treatment - to prevent blending episodes. Considering the prophylactic treatment, this can be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary prophylaxis [1]. Although prophylactic treatment can lead to better clinical outcomes, improving the quality of life, some literature reports that this type of treatment is more expensive than the â€œon-demandâ€� therapy [5]. It is important to note that the drugs used in these treatments â€“ CFC - are very expensive and fully financed by governmental entities in developed countries. According to a study involving five European countries, the total annual cost of treating severe haemophilia for 2014 was estimated at EUR 1.4 billion, or just under EUR 200,000 per patient [5]. The same study indicated that CFC represents up to 99% of those costs. Given the characteristics of disease and the impact on PHW, their families, and society in general, institutions as the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) and the European Haemophilia Consortium (EHC), recommend establishing National Patient Registries (NPR). This type of tool is defined as a nationwide repository system of demographic, social and clinical data for people suffering from a particular disease [2] [3]. According to Colvin et al. [3] the NPR promotes a more assertive analysis of standards of care, and can be used as a tool for characterizing a particular population, to know its conditions (identifying prevalence and incidence of the disease) and to audit clinical services, supporting the development of better quality of care and resource planning. In fact, the literature identifies a set of advantages associated with the existence of this type of tool. Some countries have already implemented their NPR [6]â€“[11], allowing comparative studies. This paper presents a characterization of Portuguese PWH based on the National Patient Registry, named Hemo@record. Hemo@record is a Web-based solution to manage the complex data associated with PWH, including clinical, social and health status monitoring data [12] [13]. Moreover, it aims to determine the prevalence and incidence of this disease comparing with the results reported in an earlier study conducted in Portugal [14], as well as the ones reported by other countries. The remaining of this paper is organized in three sections: section 2 presents the data and methods used in the study, section 3 presents its main results and finally section 4 draws conclusions and presents ideas for future work. Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 995â€“1001 997 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 2. Materials and Methods This is a first study using data from the Portuguese NPR to characterize PWH. The data collected includes, among others, socio-demographic information (e.g. age, sex, academic achievements, occupational activity), diagnosis, severity of haemophilia A and B, type of von Willebrand Disease (vWD), presence of inhibitors, virology status, treatment information, consumed CFC. More detail about the types of variables collected on the Portuguese NPR can be founded in [15]. As reported by the WFH, haemophilia affects individuals at a ratio of approximately 1 case per 10 000 people [1]. Considering that Portugal has about 10 million inhabitants, the expected number of PWH in Portugal is approximately 1000 cases. However, registries about identified cases by the Portuguese Association of Haemophilia (PAH) report about 700 cases. Thus, data considered in this study (110 patients), which were introduced by different HTC in the NPR system, represents 16% of PWH in Portugal. Hemo@record data was exported to an Excel sheet and the data analysis was based on simple descriptive statistics. Main results related to: (i) socio-demographic characteristics; (ii) clinical characteristics, and (iii) replacement therapy are presented in the next section. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Socio-demographic characteristics of the patients The Portuguese Haemophilia Register has 95.5% of male and 4.5% of female PWH. The age range is 5â€“82 years old; the mean value is 37 years, the median is 35 years and the first and third quartiles are 25 and 50 years old, respectively. As can be seen in table 1, thirteen patients (11.8%) are children (<15 years old); seven patients (6.4%) are young adults (from 15 to 21 years old), and the remaining patients are adults ([22 â€“ 40] 41.8%, [41 - 65] 35.5%) and seniors (> 66 years old) (4.5%). These results are similar to the obtained in a previous survey conducted in Portugal using a questionnaire [14]. Table 1: Distribution of patients by age range Age range Number Per cent <15 13 11,8% 15 - 21 7 6,4% 22 - 40 46 41,8% 41 - 65 39 35,5% >66 5 4,5% Total 110 100% Concerning academic achievements, the majority of PWH have secondary education (30.9%), 16.4% have higher education, 8.2% elementary education, and 3.6% of patients do not have elementary education. The academic achievement was not applied in 15.5% and with no information in 25.5% of the patients (see table 2). Table 2: Distribution of patients by academic achievement Academic achievement Number Per cent Without elementary education 4 3.6 % Elementary education 9 8.2 % Secondary Education 34 30.9 % Higher Education 18 16.4 % n.a 17 15.5 % unknown 28 25.5 % Total 110 100% 998 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 995â€“10014 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 In terms of occupational activity, 10% of PWH are students, 46.6 % employed, 11.8% retired, and 2.7% are unemployed. This condition was not applied in 6.4% and with no information in 22.75% of the patients (see table 3). Table 3: Distribution of patients by occupational activity Occupational activity Number Per cent Student 11 10.0 % Active 51 46.4 % Retired 13 11.8 % Unemployed 3 2.7 % n.a 7 6.4 % unknown 25 22.7 % Total 110 100% 3.2. Clinical characteristics of the patients Regarding the type of bleeding disorder, 75.5% suffer with haemophilia A (HA), 11.8% with haemophilia B (HB), 8.2% with vWD and 4.5% with other types of coagulopathies (see Table 4). These results were found to be similar to the previous survey conducted in Portugal through a questionnaire [14]. Table 4: Distribution of patients by inherited coagulopathies Type of coagulopathy Number Per cent Haemophilia A 83 75,5 % Haemophilia B 13 11,8 % von Willebrand 9 8,2 % Other coagulopathies 5 4.5 % Taking into account these data, the observed ratio of HA to HB is 6.2:1, very similar to the data reported in the previous study performed in Portugal (6.6:1) [14], as well as in the studies conducted in other countries, such as Spain (6.5:1) [8] and Poland (6.2:1) [16]. Considering HA severity, 66.3% of the patients present a severe level, 7.2 % a moderate one and 24.1% a mild level. 2.4 % of the patients have no reference related with severity of the disease. In HB, usually not as frequent as HA, 76.9 % present a severe level, 15.4 % a moderate one, and for 7.7% there is no information about severity. Table 5 presents details of the disease severity in both cases, showing a larger incidence of the severe levels. An additional analysis of the data base reveals the existence of patients with mild severity without diagnosis and, consequently, without proper treatment. Table 5 â€“ distribution of patients by severity of ha and HB. Type Severe (<1%) n (%) Moderate (1-5%) n (%) Mild (5-40%) n (%) HA (n=83) 55 (66.3%) 6 (7.2%) 20 (24.1%) HB (n=13) 10 (76.9%) 2 (15.4%) 0 (0%) Inhibitors were detected in 13 (11.8%) patients. The frequency of inhibitor development was 12 in HA patients (11 severe and one moderate) and one in HB patients (severe). The prevalence of inhibitors in HA and HB is in line with the results regarding another country (ex: [17]). Concerning the virology status information, twenty per cent (20%) of the PWH were infected with HCV (Hepatitis C Virus), and about eleven per cent (10.9%) with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).

Replacement therapy of the patients Concerning the replacement of the clotting factor in deficit, the registry data indicate that 88.2% (97) of PWH do replacement treatments; of those patients 60,8% (59) are under home treatment (see table 6).

Concluding remarks This study analysed 110 records of PWH registered on the Portuguese NPR, 95.5% males and 4.5% females; the results confirmed the high prevalence of haemophilia A (75.5%) compared with haemophilia B (11.8%), as well as a large incidence of severe levels. The results also revealed the presence of inhibitors in 11.8% of patients with a higher incidence in severe HA. These results are comparable to the findings of other similar studies conducted in other countries, as well as a previous study conducted in Portugal using a questionnaire to collect data. Concerning the treatment based on replacement of the CFC, the results revealed that 88.2% of PWH make this kind of treatment (54% following an on-demand protocol, and the remaining 46% on prophylactic treatment), and of those, 60.8% are under home treatment. The recombinant CFC is used in 43% of PWH, plasmatic factor in 44% and both types of CFC in 13% of the cases. This study also confirmed the effortlessness in characterizing the incidence and prevalence of a disease using data collected automatically from a national registry system. As future work, we expect to increase the number of PWH in the Portuguese NPR and, consequently, to carry out a more comprehensive characterization study including a larger and more representative sample. In fact, the results obtained from any NPR in this context promote insight about the portrayal of haemophilia in a country, which allows a more efficient management of resources and a better quality of care.

An updated registry of data on this disease is of paramount importance for documenting prevalence, planning care, and evaluating effectiveness of resources in any country. The study presented in this paper is aimed at characterizing Portuguese patients’ clinical condition and demography, as well as the replacement therapy used in their treatment, based on hemo@record data, a technological solution that supports the National haemophilia registry. The analysis of 110 patients records confirmed the high prevalence of haemophilia A (75.5%) compared with haemophilia B (11.8%) and a large incidence in the severe levels (or the existence of people with mild severity without diagnosis and, consequently, without proper treatment) promoting insight about the portrayal of haemophilia in Portugal. This study should be extended as the registry evolves fostering an ever more efficient management of resources and ultimately a better quality of care for people with haemophilia.

Introduction Nowadays, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) pretends to allow â€œsmart decisionsâ€� for managing disruptive events via decentralized production control [1]. The management of knowledge is one of the achieve challenges of the industry, mainly in the context of industry 4.0. Expert operators acquire valuable knowledge about the manufacturing processes and the transference of this knowledge to new operators is a difficulty process in companies. This happens since this transference is sometimes not efficient or even does not take place, endangering the future of organizations [2]. Business Process Management emerges as a management discipline with the purpose of build a process-centric thinking [3]. Business process models can be useful to assess the limitations of current processes, while representing an As-Is model (that is a snapshot of the present process), and after a careful analysis, while representing a To-Be model (representation of the business flows that is intended to achieve). The Business process management as well as business process models can have an important role in knowledge management, since they can convert the informal knowledge of processes to formal knowledge [4, 5]. One of the tools that has been considered to be crucial for modelling business processes is the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) [6, 7]. Industry 4.0 has is core in implementing technologies which enable the creation of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) [8]. This new context requires more flexibility and agility to meet customer needs. To achieve these both requirements companies will need faster decision-making processes and production systems self-adjusting and self-optimized [9]. This way, information and knowledge will have to move through the company more quickly. However, as already mentioned in Haldin-Herrgard [10], in organizations, knowledge resources have significantly been labelled as an iceberg, where the explicit knowledge is the observable top of the iceberg, and below the surface (where there is a significant part of this phenomenon), it is assumed that remains the tacit knowledge. Therefore, it is essential to capture the tacit knowledge and place it in the smallest possible portion in relation to the explicit, in order to the company does not lose organisational knowledge when its employees leave. As cited in Jerman [11], â€œYou do not only gain competence through formal education but also through life-long learningâ€�, and many organizations realize the promotion of competencies as the key to developing competitive advantage, having the same time an upgrading in companyâ€™s performance, promoting knowledge at all organizationâ€™s levels. Currently, the loss of skills due to the turnover of the workforce is something to be avoided by companies, since the creation of value in industry 4.0 can be profitably achieved through the adoption of technologies that end up placing human beings at the centre of the innovation process [12]. The goal of this paper is to take advantage of business process models to represent the knowledge associated with the tasks of operators on the shop floor of an organization belonging to the chemical industry, thus transforming the tacit knowledge of these employees in explicit knowledge (creating a knowledge repository). Furthermore, through the analysis of these models we will be able to identify gaps and weaknesses in the enterprise 'processes. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) is applied in this paper to promote the integration between organizational knowledge and business process management. The present article is structured as follows: in the second section there is a literature review, where concepts such as knowledge management, business process management, BPMN and industry 4.0 are specified. Then, in the third section the case study is shown, where the context of the problem, methodology, results and discussion of them are presented. Finally, the conclusion intends to summarize the relationship between the concepts explained by the academy's analysis and the results taken in practice, in order to raise the need to apply the BPMN language to the manufacturing floor and how much it can favour the organizational knowledge. 2. Theoretical Background 2.1 Knowledge Management The combination of data and information to which is added expert opinion, skills and experience is called knowledge [13]. It may be explicit or tacit, the latter being associated with the minds of knowledge holders, and therefore difficult to communicate, share and put into a document or database [13, 14]. On the other side the explicit one is typically Juliana Salvadorinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 981â€“988 983 Juliana Salvadorinho & Leonor Teixeira / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 structured and retrievable, and should often being in repositories, embedded in documents, organizational routines, processes, practices and norms [4, 5, 13, 14]. As cited in Ebrahimi, Ibrahim, Razak, Hussin, & Sedera [15], an organizationâ€™s competitiveness depends on its specialized knowledge, its diversity and the way it is integrated effectively in the company. Rules and directives, routines and self-managing teams are the mechanisms for integrating knowledge, and the last one (self-managing teams) is the most adequate for integration of knowledge for non-routine and complex organizational tasks that include uncertainty and novelty. Knowledge is a vital resource for obtaining competitive advantage, converted into quality improvement and more efficient business processes [16]. Knowledge management is as a strategy of getting the right knowledge to the right people at the right time, facilitating sharing of information between people, putting it at the same time into action providing the organizational performance improvement [5]. Its lifecycle has four core tasks, knowledge creation, knowledge storage/codification, knowledge transfer/distribution and knowledge application [17, 18]. Knowledge must be transferred or shared to have a wide organizational impact, representing the knowledge embedded in the organizationâ€™s processes one of the main components of knowledge management (having for that a process oriented perspective) [18â€“20]. Nowadays, KM is one of the biggest challenges for organizations. For small and medium enterprises (SMEs), this practical is more important because they usually cannot afford the investment needed to achieve a credible business value from knowledge management. This group of enterprises end with erosion of knowledge due to the leaving of key employees [18]. 2.2 Business Process Management and Business Model and BPMN According to [21] â€œBusiness Process Management (BPM) is valued as a means to gain and sustain competitive advantageâ€�, since this methodology allows companies a faster organizational adaptation to the continuously changing requirements of the market and its customers, enabling development and continuous improvement of corporate strategies [22, 23]. BPM is also a subject that is strongly tailored to the modelling of organizational processes and the subsequent implementation of process models in executable software [24]. From a lifecycle point of view, this subject includes activities such as â€œidentification, definition, modelling, implementation, execution, monitoring, control and improvement of processesâ€� [25]. It promotes cross-functional processes synchronization and facilitates companies to focus on what is believed value from the customerâ€™s perspective [26]. The BPMN is already the de-facto and widely accepted standard language among others for most business experts to model processes [7, 27]. It offers the advantages of a graphical language, simplicity, standardization and provision for execution processes [27, 28]. Besides, it is capable of unify the way business analysts and technical developers see process models [3, 6]. 2.3 Industry 4.0 and Organizational Knowledge The emergence of new technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Big Data is encompassed by the concept of Industry 4.0 [29]. These new tendencies have their role in improving the transmission of information throughout the entire system [30]. Therefore, the Industry 4.0 â€˜execution systemâ€™ is based on the interrelations between CPS building blocks. This kind of blocks can be seen as embedded systems with decentralized control and advanced connectivity [31]. In the growing of Industry 4.0 environment it is perceived that there is a lack of knowledge sharing, control on data management practices, as well as lack of understanding of how companies should integrate 4.0 technologies, in order to improve the workflow in businesses [32]. This transition in the industrial sector establishes new challenges and requirements to the knowledge management in enterprises. Smart factories can enjoy, from knowledge management systems, the possibility of implementing and organizing newly value creation networks more efficiently and successfully. Beyond that, these systems support the unification of these networks within internal manufacturing processes and resources [33]. In any organization, individuals draw and behave according to a corpus of generalizations that are summarized in own experiences, specific knowledge, procedures and routines, and this is called the organizational knowledge [34]. 984 Juliana Salvadorinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 981â€“9884 Juliana Salvadorinho & Leonor Teixeira / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 Some companies promote the development of organizational learning (OL) capabilities and this influences knowledge, beliefs and behaviours within the organization which allow business growth and innovation. In the literature appear that OL can occur based upon trial and error situations or consists of work procedures and routines established from stored knowledge in organizationâ€™s memory employed in successive situations like those that initially offered the experience [35, 36]. If I4.0 allows a faster and richer understanding about products, processes and services, the OL development may be expected to have their learning and information sharing catalysed by 4.0 technologies [36]. The adoption of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) dominates the I4.0 context and aims at increasing the flexibility and adaptability of production system, although the human factor must be considered [37]. The operator of the future, already mentioned on the literature as Operator 4.0, will have to have news skills related to KM. In order to aid humans at workplaces, the dissemination of information and knowledge becomes important and this dissemination is has to be with and among operators and managers [38, 39]. It is also essential assure that information reaches its target in a way that is perceivable by the end user, helping him to perform its operations and make decisions [37, 39]. ICTs will accelerate the collection, storage and retrieval of knowledge, however they still strive to express the so called tacit knowledge [40, 41]. In fact, ICT is a key element in knowledge management, since it is capable of integrate fragmented knowledge, eliminating at the same time barriers to communication within the organization. Therefore, ICT-support can improve work and businesses efficiency, which will allow the increase of overall organizationâ€™s performance [42]. However, in order to integrate knowledge in ICT, in a paradigm of rapid knowledge change such as that characterizing I4.0, it is important to ensure the mapping of work instructions, as well as the management of these processes. It is also essential to establish new points of connection between the human operators and the digital systems in manufacturing, in the sense of providing them with technical information or updating production databases with information concerning the status of production. It is believed that the operatorâ€™s productivity will be stimulated by the increased flexibility of the workplace and the ability to more easily learn [37]. 3 Case Study 3.1 Problem contextualization, objectives and methodology This case study has its main goal in showing how organizational knowledge can be obtained and facilitated using for that the representation of the working instructions through the BPMN 2.0. The company where the case was developed produces flush toilets. The production area is the core task, with about 80% of the employees working there (a total of about 400 employees) in two distinguished areas: injection and assembly areas. The injection area works almost only with injection moulding machines and the main actors that intervene in this section are the Injection Operator, Injection Technician, Logistics, Injection Team Leader, Quality, Planning and Maintenance. The assembly area is mostly stocked by injection area, being that there are isolated manufacturing cells and others that are in stream with injection machines. For all manufacturing cells there are standard processes, notably for filling OEE sheets, which aim to check cell and operator efficiency, the declaration process of productions in the companyâ€™s ERP (IS transversal to all the departments) and how to proceed when downtime results from malfunctions, shortages or even non-conformities. The Kanban (a card that assures the supply of parts to the production line as needed, increasing efficiency) is used in this side of the enterprise and lean tools here implemented, such as sequencing, batching and levelling boards. These instruments work similarly to any cell. Here the main actors in the processes are the Assembly Operator, Mizusumashi Operator, Supplier, Assembly Team Leader, Area Manager, Planning and Logistics Team Leader. This paper presents a shop floor tasksâ€™ mapping repository (of the main figures evidenced above), using the concepts of BPM and BPMN 2.0. This repository aims at knowledge management in an unstable environment that characterizes the I4.0 environment, since it will make available know-how to manage the rotation of the workforce of employees, preserving knowledge inside doors, without losing it with the departure of key workers. Having in account the Business Process Management life cycle described by [43], the strategy that was followed is settled in the three first stages, Process Identification (PI), Process Discovery (PD) and Process Analysis (PA). In the first phase â€“PI â€“ the most relevant processes are identified. The second phase, in the PD, detailed about processes are identified and documented through the AS-IS Models (using BPMN 2.0). In the third one, the main problems are Juliana Salvadorinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 981â€“988 985 Juliana Salvadorinho & Leonor Teixeira / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 identified and analysed and subsequently the TO-BE models are mapped. 3.2 Results and Discussion As mentioned, the aim of this work is to map the working instructions normally present in workersâ€™ tacit knowledge and therefore knowledge which is difficult to transmit, causing organisational problems, in particular loss of knowledge when workers rotate or leave from the organisation. In short, it is intended to convert tacit knowledge using by workers in the execution of different tasks in a companyâ€™s shop floor into explicit knowledge, by usage of BPM concepts. As can be observed in Figure 1, in the injection area the process initiates with the execution of the Daily Mold Change Plan. The Injection Technician has in his power the injection moulding machine monitoring through Andon lights, the box supply for parts coming out of injection machines and the mold change preparation and assistance. Furthermore, the operator controls the parts quality, dimensionally and functionally. The Injection Technician solves malfunctions that can happen in injection machines and carries out mold changes. The Injection Team leader is a point of contact with other entities like the maintenance technician, the planning and the quality. He solves some problems that the Operator cannot solve and furthermore he opens work orders in the companyâ€™ Enterprise Resource Planning to Maintenance. Given the limited space, in this work only the maps related to the work of the Injection Technician (Fig. 1) and the Assembly Operator (Fig. 2) will be explained and graphically explained. Figure 1- Map of working instructions of Injection Technician based on BPMN 2.0. As shown in figure 2, in the assembly area the operator must, in addition to assembling the different components, fill in the OEE sheet, inform the team leader whenever something goes wrong (e.g. device breakdown), record production and at the end of the shift ensure the execution of the 5 S's. On the other side, the Assembly Team Leader is the person who update the Daily Kaizen Board Indicators as well as the allocation of operators by workstations. Figure 2- Map of working instructions of Assembly Operator based on BPMN 2.0. This person must also monitor the working rate of each cell allocated to them and audit them according to safety 986 Juliana Salvadorinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 981â€“988 6 Juliana Salvadorinho & Leonor Teixeira / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 rules. It also controls the supply by Mizusumashi by placing the so-called query's in the levelling frames. And in this area, it is this person who opens work orders in the event of malfunctions in machines or mounting devices to maintenance. The Mizusumashi Operator is guided by the queryâ€™s placed by the team leaders on the levelling board. It has its own supermarket where it supplies itself and then supplies the line edges of the cells that belong to it. Between the Mizusumashi Operator and the assembly operator there is always communication whenever there is supply in the cell so that the Mizusumashi knows what needs to be supplied and in what quantity. It is also this operator who executes the batch construction framework that controls what should be and when it should be removed from logistics by the logistics Supplier Operator. It is only at the end of the shift that the Mizusumashi Operator tends to write off consumables on the ERP by executing it by scanning the query's barcodes. Lastly, The Supplier Operator has three main tasks, supply the Mizuâ€™s supermarkets, collect finished product pallets and empty boxes pallets. During the analysis of the tasks performed in the two main areas of the company, some problems were identified: (i) performing redundant tasks; (ii) lack of communication between systems; (iii) manual records (high paper traffic); (iv) outdated information in the computer system; and (v) low level of real-time machine state interpretation. The understanding of business processes is claimed in academia as the survival of the organization and currently, the business process modelling is a fundamental part of many companies, since document and redesign complicated organizational processes [23]. Regarding the KM, the essential goal of this practice is to transform implicit or tacit knowledge into an explicit one (representing in a formal way). Besides, after this representation, the distribution throughout the organization is a target, contributing to enterprise knowledge availability and re-usability, building internalized pragmatic expertise [19]. In fact, the representation of tacit knowledge through process maps using BPMN in this work, as well as the subsequent analysis to identify potential sources of waste, has not only made it explicit and more easily transmissible, but has also boosted the creation of a repository of useful knowledge when moving or leaving employees. The amalgamation of KM into business processes has become a potential feasible and theoretical task in KM [23] and BPM is capable to offer procedures for â€œknowledge capturing, externalization, formalization, structuring and re-useâ€� [19]. Cyber-physical systems have been predicted as facilitators of knowledge services in smart systems [16], since they are constituted by digital technologies which are able to create and share knowledge [41]. These technologies offer connectivity among activities and stakeholders at all levels, creating an enterprise integration When a company implement a KM practices, a main subject having into account is how this KM assist the accomplishment of organizationâ€™s goals. In that way, the alignment between the KM strategy and the business strategy is essential [44]. Although, a whole work must be done in capturing what is already in peopleâ€™s minds, and a collaborator strategy needs to be aligned. In smart factory complex system the human element is an often forgotten piece [11], although the I4.0 paradigm brings the obligation to educate collaborators with new curricula in order to cope with the growing necessities of the factories of the future [12]. The Operator 4.0 must have access to information and knowledge, in an effort to make decisions, learn faster new tasks or just to monitor the current operational state [39]. A knowledge cycle must be created in enterprises, where all begins in capturing tacit knowledge that could be stimulated by the sharing of formalized and documented knowledge (explicit). 4 Final Remarks and Future Work The Business Process Modelling is a crucial tool to represent and to analyse processes in an organizationâ€™s environment. The resulting maps allow the visualization of connections between processes and systems which helps to identify gaps and think which processes should be automatized. In this paper the BPMN 2.0 was used to represent human tasks in an organization in order to achieve an organizational knowledge repository. It was concluded that almost the entire shop floor is excessively dependent on the human hand and that the processes are nonetheless very manual. Considering the information systems that the company has, it stands out as a suggestion of future work, the modelling of these same systems and their updating in order to contemplate the processes highlighted in this paper. Only after a good process stabilization in the factory MES is there, as a second suggestion of future work, a feasibility analysis of the introduction of AI techniques that consider Process Mining. Moreover, even though the existing business process modelling tools support the modelling and execution of Juliana Salvadorinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 981â€“988 987 Juliana Salvadorinho & Leonor Teixeira / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 business processes, they lack some assistance in knowledge dimension, having some authors that have already proposed extensions to the language (BPMN 2.0) for this purpose [23]. There are some issues making difficult to transfer and share of knowledge, such as the struggle for operators in putting their knowledge into words, the absence of standardization to capture and document knowledge, the considered extreme time recognized by employees to spend on documentation and, above all and most importantly, the use by workers of their knowledge as a guarantee to remain relevant and indispensable in their workplace [45]. From a knowledge point of view, process orientation is vital to deliver task appropriate knowledge in the organizationâ€™s operational business processes context [20]. Furthermore, knowledge is broadly well-known for being the enhancer of long-term growth, development and existence of competitiveness in any enterprise. And nowadays, there is a great amount of information and knowledge that is extremely valuable and is not made externalized or formalized, resulting in not being used by other individuals and sometimes it can even be lost for the enterprise [19]. To conclude Business Process Modelling can be applied in order to establish the knowledge management in a company. Furthermore, it also serves as a tool to study all the gaps in the enterpriseâ€™s processes. With the perception of these gaps BPM can help improving organizationâ€™s industry 4.0 environment, as well as to facilitate the acquisition and transfer of knowledge. Although it is important reveal the difficulty in applying changes in organizationâ€™s processes. The documentation of these processes it is important in order to facilitate people adaptation to workstations. Knowledge management can mitigate the revolt to change felt by people in general by creating a more transparent and balanced climate in which everyone can know everything.

This sharing of knowledge could help in the faster adaptation of humans to workstations and could bring the more agile accommodation of artificial intelligence techniques to allow the self-learning. The Business Process Management (BPM) is a technique which enables the representation and analysis of processes, has been already mention in the literature as a useful tool that can facilitate the Knowledge Management. A process repository can be accomplished with BPM, thus promoting agile and fast knowledge transfer in a context where new skills emerge and must be quickly taken up. This paper intends to show the development of the working instructions maps, with workers’ tacit knowledge, using the BPMN 2.0, in a chemical industry. This representation allowed the creation of a knowledge’s repository which will help the company (in a I4.0 environment) to deal with the most existing workforce rotation, thus preserving most of the knowledge within the company itself.

For this solution, a bus network is used to combine the cargo flow with the passenger flow within the cities. After a literature review, a user-centered approach supported by interviews with key stakeholders was followed to define the concept, followed by solution modelling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. Thus, the high-level requirements will be presented based on a use-cases diagram and the data model based on a class diagram. Also, the automatic order check-in and check-out process on the bus is designed, using Industry 4.0 and IoT principles. This process is relevant since it speeds up the handling of orders in transshipments, reduces the possibility of human error, while at the same time enhancing control and promoting real-time knowledge of the delivery status of orders. The results of this study expand the knowledge in an area with scarce literature.

Introduction The continuously increasing share of population living in urban areas and the rise of online internet sales (e- commerce) reinforce the concern and importance of adopting solutions that help urban areas to improve their life 808 Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“8152 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 quality. Freight and transport have been considered as a significant disturbance to the quality of the urban spaces, especially near areas of historical and artistic value [1]. According to [1] in 1950 only 30% of the global population was living on urban areas, but it is expected that in 2050 this value increases to 66% and in 2100 it reaches 85%, representing an increase of 8 billion of people living is such areas. According to reports by eMarketer (May 2019), annual B2C e-commerce sales reached 3.5 trillion dollars in 2019, 20% more than the previous year, and it is expected to reach 6.5 trillion dollars in 2023. It is important to note that the increase in the transport of goods to the home of consumers instead of conventional retail stores will result in a significant increase in logistics transport vehicles and, consequently, an increase in urban traffic. This increase in traffic contributes significantly to the increase of traffic congestion, noise and environmental pollution, road accidents and the emission of greenhouse gases [2]. Additionally, new services and startups have emerged to respond to the growing market segment where end consumers or companies that buy online intend to receive their goods in less than an hour or two, already representing about 2.5% of all transport within large cities [1]. Also, according to these authors, the increase in this type of instant transport leads to a significant increase in the number of vehicles operating in city centers. Thus, although the main focus of urban logistics is on the main carriers operating in the market, it is necessary to think of a solution for urban logistics that is transversal in the supply chain, making it integrated and sustainable [3]. This paper presents the conceptual model of an integrated solution (SOLFI) for urban logistics. SOLFI is mainly a solution for an environmental-friendly transportation service within cities through the integration of flows of people and goods using, whenever possible, the same transportation network. SOLFI is a new logistics service for the distribution of goods in urban environments, focusing on the use of the bus transportation infrastructure operating in the urban network and the use of environmentally friendly fleets, to ensure the last mile delivery of some types of goods. The new service is particularly suited to the delivery of parcels to shops, private customers or public or private entities [4]. For this study, an exploratory approach has been followed. The research topic emerged from a real problem experienced by practitioners in urban logistics area being the aim of this research is to present a potential innovative solution for that problem. Accordingly to [5] our problem can be classified as â€œclass (2) well-structured problem situations with clear objectives but uncertain user requirementsâ€� and the authors suggest that data modelling, process modelling or prototyping are likely to be appropriate methodologies in these situations. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 Urban Logistics and the use of advanced technologies are presented. Section 3 briefly describes the integrated urban logistics service proposed (SOLFI). In Section 4 a conceptual model for SOLFI is presented. The paper concludes with Section 5 where the main conclusions of this research are drawn. 2. Urban logistics: context and challenges Urban logistics, or city logistics, is an important subject of urban mobility concerned with the activities of delivering and collecting goods in a town and city centers. These activities typically entail the processes of transportation, handling and storage of goods, the management of inventory, waste and returns as well as home delivery services, being of critical importance their support through advanced information systems considering the traffic environment, its congestion, safety and energy savings [6]. [7] define urban logistics as â€œthat part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and point of consumption in order to meet customersâ€™ requirements, as influenced by complex interactions among densely populated social systems and associated infrastructureâ€�. The problem of urban logistics is characterized by a very high degree of complexity. One of the main sources of complexity is due to the fact that there are several stakeholders with different and sometimes contradictory objectives. On one hand, we have local and central government, urban planners and residents whose main concern focuses on sustainability of cities and quality of life. On the other hand, we have customers, suppliers and distribution companies whose focus is on reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This uncertain and ambiguous environment in city logistics makes decision making evermore challenging [8]. Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“815 809 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 Currently, the distribution of goods in cities is carried out by private companies, typically by logistics operators or by the suppliers of the goods themselves, through a dedicated fleet of vehicles (typically vans and trucks) powered by fuels derived from Petroleum. In this context, the problem is aggravated by the existence of a huge number of small orders (in volume and weight) that must be collected and/or delivered to a large number of customers (private as well as public/private and/or retail services), concentrated in some areas dispersed in the city, which implies a great challenge in the optimization of daily loads, in order to provide a service adjusted to the needs of customers and to optimize the available resources. On the other hand, passenger transport in the city is mostly provided by a dedicated network, public or private, of buses, taxis, trams and metro. Throughout the daily operation, there are significant variations in the number of passengers using a transport service, although the transport network continues to operate uninterruptedly throughout the day, albeit with less frequency. This situation leads to the system's performance, in terms of capacity utilization, being less than desirable, creating challenges in terms of fleet and driver management. This complex challenge entails the need to minimize the negative impacts associated with the traditional way of distributing goods within cities. In this context, a new perspective resulting from the integration of passenger flows and freight flows, in order to ensure the distribution of goods in a more efficient and environmentally responsible manner, making use, whenever possible, of the same transport network, is gaining attention. This integration is being reported, in several case studies [9] [10] [11] [12] [13], although the literature in which it is properly studied is almost inexistent. The implementation and operation of these shared/collaborative networks remain a big challenge [14]. This co-modality, the combination of passenger traffic and freight transport, is one of the major dimensions of City Logistics 4.0, along with others such as integrated platforms based on advanced ICT, ITS, IoT and AI systems, and public-private partnerships involving participation of all stakeholders (government, shippers, freight carriers, administrators, residents) for balancing economic growth and environmental friendliness [15], [16]. In the recent literature several advanced technologies are being proposed to support urban logistics activities and reduce its negative impacts. As an example, [17] propose a drone-based parcel delivery using rooftops of city buildings. [18] approach an urban logistics system grounded in networks of smart locker banks as pickup and delivery points in the inner city. Also, [19] introduce the Joint Distribution urban logistics concept, which is an intelligent platform to provide efficient, reliable, high-quality, low-cost and personalized logistics services for the whole process of delivery, using Internet of things, Internet, Cloud computing and RFID. To conclude, [20] use a Cyber Physical System to dispatch urban logistics vehicles. 810 Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“815 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3. SOLFI: the proposed integrated urban logistics solution This paper intends to propose a solution to develop an efficient and environmental-friendly transportation service within cities. This new service is based on an intelligent decision support system helping operational planning. To accomplish this, the solution uses bus network of passenger flow and its available capacity to transport goods into the city center. This solution also considers a last-mile operator, with an environmental-friendly fleet, to deliver the volumes from the bus to the final customer. The main steps of the proposed solution are illustrated in figure 1. The key pieces of the solution can be briefly described as follows: â–ª Request release - The customers/sender of this service are any type of entity that intends to send goods to a location within the city, typically a logistics company, a retailer, or a private customer. Each customer places the order in the system providing the initial address, destination address, quantity, time window for delivery to the final customer and release time. This customer/sender is responsible for deliver the order at the hub indicated by the intelligent decision support system. â–ª Hub - Place where bus routes start and where orders are left by customers/senders. Subsequently, orders are organized and each one is assigned to a bus route. â–ª Bus transport service - The arrival time of each bus service to the respective hub and the transportation time between the hub and each stop of the route are known. Buses have capacity constraints that must be considered to maintain the service level of the passenger flow. â–ª Bus stop - Each bus stop is characterized by its unloading capacity and the time needed to unload the goods last-mile operator. It is assumed that goods cannot be loaded into the buses at the bus stop but only on respective hubs. â–ª Last-mile operator â€“ logistic operator to deliver goods from the bus stop to the final destination. This entity is responsible to guarantee the delivery time window at the final customer. â–ª Final customer â€“ The entity that receive and confirm that the order has been delivered at the right location. 4. The conceptual model for SOLFI - integrated urban logistics solution The following subsections describe the system through Unified Modeling Language (UML) models [21], [22]. The UML models provide information about static structure and dynamic behavior of the system through diagrams that are windows or views unto UML models. The UML diagrams can be divided in two main categories: structural and Figure 1 - Main steps of SOLFI - integrated urban logistics solution Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“815 811 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 behavioral. The structural group describes the components of the system and their relationships such as package diagrams, component diagrams or class diagrams and the behavioral category describes the behavior of the system over time, for example, activity diagrams or use case diagrams. The next subsections present the UML use case diagram to illustrate the functional requirements of the system and its representation from the userâ€™s point of view and also the UML class diagram as a data model to represent the main information objects, and relationships, to accomplish the functional requirements. In this project and after a literature review, a user-centered approach supported by interviews with key stakeholders was followed to define the conceptual model. These interviews were non-structured and exploratory interviews that were performed with key partners of the project, such as, public transportation enterprises, last mile operators and logistic operators, contributing to design the concept for this solution. 4.1. Functional requirements of the solution The high-level use case diagram illustrates the main functional requirements of the system, the use cases as ellipses and the actors in the system as human figures. The figure 2 shows a use-case diagram illustrating the main functionalities and actors of the SOLFI system. This model starts with the customer/sender performing a use case which is â€œrequest order quotationâ€�. Then the system calculates the final quotation and performs planning, using algorithms and optimization models, to transport the respective order and returns the information to the customer who requested the quotation. Note that the use cases that are performed by the system are represented in blue, in order to distinguish them from the use cases performed by the other actors. The customer is also notified by the system of the distribution plan for his/her order. After receiving notifications from the system with the final quote and the order distribution plan, the customer decides whether to register the order or not. In case of customer proceed with the order placement, it is necessary to confirm the order, which will authorize the system to create notifications and send them to all actors involved in the order distribution process. These notifications include the distribution plan with details for each of the actors who will interact with the order such as the estimated time when the order arrives to each part in the delivery process. Thus, the customer is notified of the location and times that the order must be dropped off at the hub and then the order is checked-in on the respective urban transport, notifying the last-mile operator this check-in was successful. Figure 2 - Use-case diagram representing the main functionalities and actors of the SOLFI system 812 Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“8156 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 The urban transporter is responsible for transporting the order along its route and communicating any disruptions in transport, such as traffic accidents, breakdowns, etc. When the bus arrives at the stop where the order has to be unloaded, a last-mile operator must be present to make the transfer between the bus for his/her vehicle. In order to minimize the stopping time for urban passenger transport, the last-mile operator performs the check-out of the order from the bus and automatically the check-in in his/her last-mile vehicle. When the check-in of the last-mile operator is carried out, a notification is sent to the final customer informing the status of the order as well as the estimated delivery time at the destination address. When the order is delivered to the destination address, the last-mile operator checks out the order from last mile transport. The final customer also has a use case that confirms receipt of the order. This model is a high-level model that illustrates the macro operation of the system as well as its requirements, step by step, throughout the order distribution process, in a scenario where everything goes well. 4.2. Data model of the solution The UML class diagram is a representation of the structure and relationships between classes as well as their attributes. This type of diagram allows to represent in a simple and graphical way the functioning of the system. A class is represented by a square divided into 2 sections: the upper section represents the name of the class, the lower section its attributes. Between classes there are relationships that are represented by a line. The figure 3 illustrates the general class diagram of the system. This diagram represents the general structure of the SOLFI solution as well as the main relationships between the key elements. The diagram starts with a sender who wants to send an order. These two classes, with their respective attributes, are related in a way that each sender can have one or more orders to send and each order can only be sent by one, and only one, sender. Then the final customer class is presented, ensuring that each order has one and only one final customer and that each final customer can have one or more orders. The order class is related to the urban transport class in which the relationship is many to many. This relationship results in the transport, which represents loading of the order to urban passenger transportation vehicle and its transportation, characterized by the date and start and arrival time. This transport is related to one and only one bus, and it can have one or more transports. The bus can have one or more weekly routes, and vice versa. Each route is associated with one and only one Hub. Each order is associated with one, and only one, bus stop for unloading. This relationship results in transshipment which represents the unloading of the order from the bus order to one, and only one, vehicle of the last-mile operator. Each last-mile operator is associated with one or more transshipment and one or more bus stops. Each last-mile operator is associated with one and only one vehicle type, but each vehicle type can be used by one or more operators.Figure 3 â€“ General UML class diagram for SOLFI 4.3. Intelligent process of check-in and check-out using Industry 4.0 technologies This subsection presents a use-case diagram developed to represent the interface between the order and the bus. The aim is to develop an automatic method to perform the check-in and check-out of the order volumes form/to the Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“815 813 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 bus automatically, through the usage of specific tools such as sensors, authentication cards or other type of technology. This method will require some adjustments on the bus structure to perform check-in and check-out automatically and on real time. This automatic approach to update the order status on the system delivers some advantages, once the human interface with the system itself is minimized, avoiding potential errors or delays during the process. These delays are even more important on the step previously named as â€œtransshipmentâ€�, where the bus stops to unload the goods to the last mile operator and has to be quick to be possible to continue his/her route and accomplish his/her schedule. The figure 4 represents a use case diagram focused on this automatic method. As can be seen from the interactions represented in the figure 4, this starts when the urban transporter enters his credentials in the system through the scanning of his personal identification card or even his/her fingerprints, assuring a fast and reliable log-in process when compared to a manual method for the same goal. The system, then, analyze the credentials and perform the authentications for the respective user. Once again, the use-cases that are performed by the system are represented with blue. After this log-in is performed successfully, the urban transporter puts the order into an available slot of a dedicated container present on the bus. This container has to be equipped with technology that can identify the presence of the order into the respective slot to confirm the check-in. After this, the system will notify the last-mile operator about the check-in status with information about the bus and slot where the order is stored. When the bus arrives to the unloading bus stop, the last-mile operator enters on the bus and insert his/her credentials in the system, through the same method used previously by the urban transporter. The system will then perform the authentication and only allows the logistic operator to access and open the slots that were assigned to him to avoid wrong order pick-ups from the bus. When the last-mile operator picks the order from the slot, the system will automatically perform the check-out of the order and update its status on the system. When the last-mile operator closes the trunk of the bus, the system registers the check-in (in the last mile operator) and at the same time notify the final customer with information about the state of the order and respective location. The system instantly updates the slot status to â€œemptyâ€� so it can receive and store more orders on the next iteration. During all the process, only the authorized users can access the parcels since these are enclosed into the containers. Figure 4 â€“ Use-case diagram reporting automatic process of check-in and check-out of the orders 5. Conclusions This paper presented the conceptual design of an integrated solution for Urban Logistics using Industry 4.0 principles, more specifically in the check-in and check-out processes. The main results of this study are the behavioral and structural modelling of the system that were documented by a set of UML diagrams, designated as use case diagram and data model. The conceptual design presented on this study has provided a better understanding of the 814 Bruno Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 180 (2021) 807â€“8158 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 real problem, since it allowed to define the actors on system, their relationships and the limitations on their actions. The models described on this study also provided some deeper insights on how the interface with the IT system should be performed to answer stakeholdersâ€™ requirements. These results were based on the literature review and the feedback from key stakeholders of this project about their needs and concerns through non-structured interviews. The final solution presented on this work implies some adaptation and investment to the bus fleet to integrate technology that enables the IoT potential and the cargo safety and, consequently, the intelligent processes of check-in and check-out. These intelligent processes are truly important for the safety, speed and flexibility during the cargo transshipments. It is important to emphasize that studies addressing solution that integrates urban passenger and goods flows are scarce in the literature so, this conceptual design is a valuable theoretical contribution for the field. Also, this work reported in this paper is part of a larger project that is under development and so, as limitations, next steps are required to test and validate the conceptual designed system proposed. The prototype of this solution will be test in a real and controlled scenario to evaluate its executability and suitability, performing some practical contribution for the field. This pilot will be performed in a near future contributing for this investigation with practical insights about the implementation of this concept in a real-world scenario. Also, structured interviews and questionnaires are being developed and will be performed on key stakeholders on the next iteration of the project, to detail and define the current concept at a lower level.

For this solution, a bus network is used to combine the cargo flow with the passenger flow within the cities. After a literature review, a user-centered approach supported by interviews with key stakeholders was followed to define the concept, followed by solution modelling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. Thus, the high-level requirements will be presented based on a use-cases diagram and the data model based on a class diagram. Also, the automatic order check-in and check-out process on the bus is designed, using Industry 4.0 and IoT principles. This process is relevant since it speeds up the handling of orders in transshipments, reduces the possibility of human error, while at the same time enhancing control and promoting real-time knowledge of the delivery status of orders. The results of this study expand the knowledge in an area with scarce literature. In practical terms this study presents valuable contributions, since it specifies a solution for urban logistics that can have environmental and social impact in the context of urban areas.

However, a limited number of studies examine the online information sources used by the accessible tourism market. To extend knowledge in this field the present study analyses the heterogeneity in the Portuguese accessible tourism market regarding online information sources used, applying a survey to 504 people with special needs (PwSN). Six segments with different types of special needs (people with hearing disabilities – PwHD -, people with visual disabilities – PwVD -, people with motor disabilities – PwMoD -, people with mental disabilities – PwMeD -, people with multiple disabilities – PwMuD and people with other special needs – PwOSN) that had participated in tourism activities are studied regarding the information sources used in a tourism trip. Results highlight the relevance of the Internet as one of the most important information sources to plan a tourism trip. However, differences among the six segments were observable. Moreover, results reveal the need to provide accessible information sources to increase the participation of PwSN in tourism activities.",

Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) have been taking advantage of technologies in order to manage destinations in a more successful way. Previous research on tourism destination online platforms has proclaimed Destination Management Systems (DMSs) as their most advanced version, mostly by giving visitors the ability to accomplish most of their travel arrangements through a reliable official platform integrating several destination components. However, most of the academic research on DMSs is conceptual and/or lacks a holistic perspective of the functionalities that characterize such systems and does not provide an overview of the functionalities that differentiate these systems from more traditional DMOs’ web platforms. The present paper intends to contribute to fill these gaps, namely to identify the functionalities that differentiate these systems by confronting previous research that focuses on potential DMS functionalities with the results of an empirical study encompassing a content analysis of 23 DMS and interviews with both DMS’s developers and DMO officials. The findings suggest a considerable mismatch between the functionalities conveyed by existing DMSs and previous research either theoretical or empirical that rely on the analysis of few DMSs. The paper ends with conclusions and suggestions regarding the development of DMSs.",

Several studies reveal that collaboration can be strongly influenced by knowledge sharing. The literature suggests that this topic is quite relevant and that there is an evident lack of empirical studies that properly investigate the relationship between knowledge-sharing and collaborative behaviour in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In this context, the purpose of this work is to examine whether knowledge-sharing intention has a positive relationship with collaborative behaviour among professors and researchers in a public Portuguese HEI, taking into account other constructs that can have effect on the knowledge-sharing intention. In order to reach this objective, a conceptual research model was developed based on the theory of reasoned action. The empirical study was conducted based on a questionnaire, and the data analysis was performed using partial least squares. The results indicate that intrinsic motivation and networking are the factors that positively affect the attitude towards knowledge sharing. Nevertheless, it is concluded that trust is the variable that more strongly affects the knowledge-sharing intention. Finally, the study identified that knowledge-sharing intention has a positive influence in collaborative behaviour. It is considered that this study can contribute to support institutions’ management in defining strategies and developing actions in order to promote an organisational culture based on knowledge management that significantly leads to knowledge-sharing and collaboration relationships.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The fast development in information and communication technologies transformed the tourism sector, raising relevant questions regarding the role of destination management organizations (DMOs) and the most appropriate way to implement and manage online platforms adopted by these organizations–destination management systems (DMSs). Nevertheless, the research concerning DMSs' adoption and management is scarce, mostly conceptual and highly fragmented, usually corresponding to theoretical discussions on a small set of adoption or management issues or to analysis of very specific examples of DMSs. This paper aims to overcome gaps in previous literature by deeply analyzing relevant factors for the adoption and management of this kind of systems. In-depth interviews were conducted with relevant organizations in DMS development and several American and European DMOs. The content analysis of the discourses resulted in a framework encompassing an adoption and management model–including reasons and challenges regarding DMSs’ adoption, management models, benefits resulting from DMS adoption–as well as current challenges and future perspectives for DMSs. The findings provide relevant theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, the paper highlights some discrepancies between the literature and the present study regarding the concept of DMSs, as well as reasons and challenges associated with their adoption and management. The need to rethink the role and management of these systems is also remarked. From a practical perspective, the framework proposed can be used by DMOs and other stakeholders engaged in the management of tourism destinations, in order to ensure the successful implementation and management of DMSs.",

A sample of 575 websites was analysed based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, using an automatic web diagnostic tool (AccessMonitor). This analysis was performed considering the A, AA, and AAA conformance levels of WCAG. Currently the state of web accessibility levels is medium, and there are still constraints that make information gathering difficult for visitors with disabilities. After the barriers are identified, proposals to design more accessible websites are presented. These proposals contribute to making museums' online information accessible to all people, independently of their needs and functional limitations.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2020 WIT Press.Smart Cities have changed from a purely technological paradigm to a holistic, integrated strategy, where the citizens play an important role in the decision-making process. Cities begin to understand the potential of integration approaches, interoperability of solutions, and start seeking strategic thinking when addressing new technologies. In this context, to implement a holistic strategy, city decision makers must have a tool that helps them to strategize according to their current state and then understand whether the actions they adopted are having the desired outcomes concerning their previously established objectives. It is not possible to create strategic visions for Smart Cities without a tool to regularly assess and monitor them. In this matter, several studies report some attempts to formulate a methodology to calculate indexes to evaluate cities' maturity level. However, they have either not taken properly into consideration indicators' weighting or the focus of the index was not clear and mixed up the key performance indicators (KPIs) of different concepts in an attempt to provide a more generic tool. Despite this, the previous studies are used as the basis to support the methodological approach of this research. This article tackles this gap in the literature by providing the most up to date Smart City assessment tool to evaluate cities. While the Smart City concept has different understandings among researchers and academia practitioners, the evolution of the concept has tended to incorporate the axes of sustainability, innovation, and quality of life. Therefore, these are featured in the present index calculation supported by the ICTs and participatory approaches. Existing standard KPIs and frameworks do not include them, focusing most of the time in one of these axes while leaving the others aside. Thus, this paper proposes to describe the development of a methodology that encompasses every one of these three axes to give cities a tool they can use to monitor their actions.",

Despite this recognition, many people with specific needs continue to identify numerous constraints that prevent them from being able to independently access, with equity and dignity, to tourism products. This paper aims to know and analyze the constraints that cause the absence of tourism experiences of people with special needs, which make up the accessible tourism market in Portugal. To respond to this objective, a questionnaire was administered to people with specific needs, especially people with disabilities, people with food and respiratory allergies, pregnant women, and people using pushchairs, about the needs, constraints and benefits related to the participation in tourism activities. Answer this questionnaire 484 people, 109 of whom had no tourist experience (22.5% of the sample). The results show that structural constraints are those that continue to inhibit people from actively participating in tourism activities. The data also point to a feeling of predisposition to the practice of this type of activity by the majority of respondents. It is therefore evident that the elimination of these barriers can boost their participation, and consequently the accessible tourism market in Portugal.",

The relevance of these players is higher to the accessible tourism market, due to the various environmental, attitudinal and informational constraints that people with disabilities (PwD) face in carrying out a tourism trip. To overcome some of the information constraints, communication channels, such as websites, used by TA, should be accessible for all people, regardless of their psychological and physical abilities. To accomplish this aim, in this study the website accessibility of (TA) located in the Central Region of Portugal was examined. Based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, a sample of 182 websites was analyzed, considering the three-conformance level of WCAG (A, AA and AAA) and using two automatic evaluation tools (AccessMonitor and “Test de Accesibilidade Web”—TAW). Results show that the websites of TA reveal several problems in relation to accessibility, particularly in the basic accessibility requirements (level A of the WCAG). Moreover, several problems were identified, mainly in the perceivable and robust principals. The paper ends with some guidelines to increase the level of web accessibility of TA.",

For this, the need to continuously analyze, improve, and standardize all the business processes involved becomes urgent. Business process management (BPM), which includes modeling, appears as a response to that need, often leading to processes dematerialization. However, standardization alone is not enough to increase a company's competitiveness. It is necessary to combine continuous improvement through the use of Lean tools, once they are suitable for identification and, consequently, for the elimination of waste and non-added value activities (NVA). This work appears with this need, having as objective the proposal of a methodology that combines the concepts of Lean and BPM, using for the process’s representation the notation BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation). The methodology was tested in a case study that involved a newly-created company belonging to the plastics industry and the results contributed to the preparation, initialization, and conclusion of the certification process with the quality standard, ISO9001: 2015.",

However, it is known that the adoption of the Lean philosophy was absorbed by the industrial environment, with results that proved to be exuberant, considering the simplicity of the tools. In this way, the I4.0 implementation must be prepared to preserve the existing manufacturing systems. MES systems will be decisive in the foundation of the I4.0 paradigm. They are capable of eliminate information silos, introduce knowledge management practices and data visualization mechanisms. Thus, their documentation is an organizational pillar, with BPMN and UML being able to guide it. However, BPMN is also likely to be applied in capturing tacit knowledge, which can be a foundation for the constitution of knowledge repositories, impacting organizational excellence. This work aims the creation of guidelines that facilitate the implementation of I4.0 strategies in Lean industrial environments.

All rights reserved.Purpose - Today, due to the large amount of data available in companies, solutions for extracting information and knowledge to support decision-making processes are needed. To address this issue, data mart implementation with proper dashboard can represent good solutions. However, due to the complexity involved in this kind of projects and its multidisciplinary nature, appropriate methodologies for conducting data mart development are needed. The present study aims to propose a framework to guide the process of development of quality data marts in a Portuguese electronics company. Methodology - The methodology used to conduct this study combined the principles of two well-known approaches - DMAIC and BPM. The first was useful in addressing and understanding the problem, while the second was used to guide the process. Two practical cases were used, the first as an experimental scenario and the second one as a testing scenario. Findings - The main result of this study is a ready to use framework to guide industrialization teams in development of quality data marts to help users in their decision-making processes. Originality/value - As there are no standard procedures available for companies to implement quality data mart solutions, the proposed framework, which is easy to apply, can be a valuable tool when a company wants to industrialize a new product. It can also be valuable for researchers working at the interface of the Quality and Information Systems areas.",

In such environments, large amounts of data are produced and there is an urgent need for organizations to take advantage of this data, otherwise its value may be lost. Data needs to be treated to produce consistent and valuable information to support decision-making. In the context of a manufacturing industry, both data analysis and visualization methods can drastically improve understanding of what is being done on the shop floor, enabling easier decision-making, ultimately reducing resources and costs. Visualization and storytelling are powerful ways to take advantage of human visual and cognitive capacities to simplify the business universe. This paper addresses the concept of “Storytelling with Data” and presents an example carried out in the shop floor of a chemical industry company meant to produce a real-time story about the data gathered from one of the manufacturing cells. The result was a streaming dashboard implemented using Microsoft Power BI.",

Nevertheless, and despite the increasing awareness of the need to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in tourism, museum websites are still identified by this group as a major constraint for visiting and having pleasurable experiences in museums. Despite the existence of constraints in this scope, empirical research that examines the accessibility of museums websites is very scarce with only one study being known in this field. Even this study only considers a small set of museums in one region of the United States and adopts a non-automatic, and thus subjective procedure, not enabling great conclusions about the accessibility of these museum web platforms. The present paper aims to fill some of the previous gaps by assessing the accessibility of websites of museums located in Portugal. To achieve this aim, a total of 575 websites of museums located across different regions were assessed using two automated tools based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: AccessMonitor and Test de Accesibilidad Web. Results reveal that although websites of museums present higher levels of accessibility than those of other tourism supply agents, they still have several accessibility problems that must be solved. Findings also show that there is a higher prevalence of failures related to the ‘perceivable’ and ‘robust’ principles, and that the accessibility level differs among the NUTS II regions where museums are located. The paper ends by identifying the main conclusions and the major implications for designers or managers of these websites.",

A comprehensive analysis of Value Added and Non-Value Added activities were performed to understand the current state of the workstation. By using the Spaghetti Diagram, the worker's movements were mapped and quantified. To eliminate motion and material transport and therefore increase productivity, an AGV system was implemented. To design this particular system, it was necessary to determine the required number of AGVs and their capacity, picking and delivery locations and the flow path. Activities such as transporting the containers and moving around to pick up the same containers were eliminated, thus contributing to a better ergonomics and an increase in safety. The Cycle Time was also reduced and therefore productivity was increased.",

In the empirical study, a questionnaire based on the technology acceptance model was applied. The results indicated that the most used technologies are Moodle, Facebook and YouTube and it was concluded that in general, those technologies are well accepted. Few statistically significant differences between respondents’ gender, scientific areas or ages were found, revealing that the use of those technologies is already widespread in the studied institution. Results also showed that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are two important determinants of Moodle acceptance, and that the majority of respondents did not know the MOOC concept. This article is valuable for researchers in the area and for professors that want to implement the use technologies in the teaching and learning context.",

Having had significant success in reducing wastes, its principles and tools can now be found applied in several industrial sectors with good results. Outside the production environment, however, literature is scarce concerning its applicability and outcome. This work presents several case studies, of companies of different sectors, where both inside and outside production areas wastes were identified and acted upon, namely, in Logistics and Production, Information Flow, and Ergonomics. Results suggest that Lean can be equally applicable and beneficial in these areas, potentially making it a viable philosophy across the company.",

Despite this recognition, due to the lack of motivation to invest in systems that benefit a small proportion of the population – characteristic of rare diseases – there are several barriers to create this type of application. This paper describes a Web-based solution to support the national haemophilia registry in Portugal, the first created in this country for this type of chronic and rare disease. Currently, the technological solution is already developed, tested, and installed at the data centre of a Portuguese University, and clinicians of different Haemophilia Treatment Center around the country have access to the operational version, via web.",

Following this, an analysis of MOOCs offered by some HEIs is carried out to characterize and compare the courses available in the platforms. Concerning the main findings, the literature reveals that usage of MOOCs has been growing in recent years and that Coursera and EdX are the two main platforms used. The analysis of MOOCs available in those platforms shows that the number of universities using them and the number of courses offered have been increasing. The comparison between the courses available through the above-mentioned platforms shows that EdX is more interdisciplinary. The outcomes of this article are valuable for researchers on ICT use in HEI and may help professors implementing MOOCs in their own environment.",

For this mission, the physical and psychological well-being of the student is very important, and the thermal environment of the classroom has an impact on the thermal comfort, which in turn can influence the mission referred above. The present study aims to analyse the influence that the thermal environment can have on the learning process of the students. It was performed in a secondary school, located in central region of Portugal. The obtained results showed that from the thermo-hygrometric data records it is possible to predict the type of thermal environment of a classroom and that the thermal environment and the thermal insulation of the clothing influence the well-being, the thermal sensation and the learning process of the students.",

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Thermal discomfort is mentioned as one of the major causes of dissatisfaction in workplaces when people are exposed to extremely hot or cold thermal environments in the industrial context. Studies evaluating the comfort of the thermal environment are becoming increasingly important, but this kind of studies is time-consuming and it becomes expensive and difficult to implement for many organizations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate thermal comfort in a metalworking industry located in Portugal, applying user-friendly thermal indexes supported by real data collected using inexpensive measuring tools. METHODS: To this end, this study was conducted using objective measurements of air temperature T (C), and relative humidity RH (%), collected using a pen data acquisition (Easy Log USB). Simultaneously, subjective answers about the perception of thermal comfort by the workers in the section studied were collected based on a questionnaire survey. RESULTS: The results revealed a high risk of heat stress for some workstations, which required the intervention of the Health and Safety Department. CONCLUSIONS: The indexes applied in this work, namely the WMO diagram and the EsConTer index, offer a sound model for thermal stress risk evaluation, minimizing difficult and time-consuming investigations to identify thermal comfort problems in workplaces, each emphasizing particular aspects, in order to create value.",

This paper presents a study on the acceptance of Educast, by students, using the Technology Acceptance Model-TAM. The data was collected through a questionnaire applied to 54 students which results were analyzed using descriptive analysis and non-parametric tests. It was concluded that students expressed a positive attitude towards the variables Perceived Ease Of Use, Perceived Usefulness and Attitude Toward Using. The comparison between ratings assigned to the questionnaire items by the students who viewed video recordings and those that did not was performed, and it was found that the former showed higher levels of agreement with the referred items than the latter. It is considered that introducing some training before students have contact with Educast should be taken into account. The result of this work can be valuable not only for researchers on the Education area, but also for teachers that intend to use educational videos in their teaching/learning environment.",

This chapter was developed aiming at exploring and critically reviewing the literature of social media use in organizational context as a knowledge management component. The review suggests that, while traditional knowledge management systems are static and often act just as knowledge repositories, social media have the potential for supporting different knowledge management processes that will impact on the organizational culture by encouraging on participation, collaboration and knowledge sharing. Despite their recognized impact on knowledge management processes, some uncertainty remains amongst researchers and practitioners and is associated to the difficulty in understanding and measuring their real impact.",

Graphical abstract Image Keywords Ergonomics Work-related disorders Thermal comfort Thermal indexes Thermal sensation EsConTer index 1 Introduction The work environment is defined as a set of surrounding elements which influences the workers' tasks at their workstations. Ergonomics is the scientific discipline that studies workplaces in order to adapt workstations to workers' welfare needs. It aims to understand the interactions and the relationship between the workers and their work environment, and create workstations with the required conditions to achieve high performance and prevent work-related disorders (Guimarães et al., 2015; IEA, 2014; Wisner, 1992). Work-related disorders, also known as occupational diseases, are unexpected and unplanned occurrences which arise in connection with work, leading to personal injury, disease, or death (Zhou et al., 2014). These disorders may be divided into different categories, such as mental disorders, noise-induced hearing loss, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Roman-liu (2013) states that a wide range of external factors in the work environment cause musculoskeletal disorders, one of the most widespread occupational pathologies (Chiasson et al., 2012; Zare et al., 2015). MSDs are developed when work demands exceed the worker's ability, i.e., the cumulative effect to the worker when under protracted load work, such as repetitive motion, excessive force, awkward or sustained postures, or prolonged sitting and standing (Ogg, 2011; Roman-liu, 2013; Costa and Vieira, 2010). These types of disorders are, citing Costa and Vieira (Costa and Vieira, 2010), associated with injuries or dysfunctions affecting muscles, bones, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilages, and spinal discs. There are several studies that demonstrate a strong relationship between comfort, health, environment control in indoor spaces, and productivity in workplaces (Akimoto et al., 2010; Bluyssen et al., 2011; Escorpizo, 2008; Lan et al., 2011; Mohamed and Srinavin, 2002; Wagner et al., 2007). One of the crucial human requirements is a working environment that allows people to perform their work optimally under comfortable conditions (Lan et al., 2011). Furthermore, citing Huizenga et al. (2006), the major cause of dissatisfaction in workplaces is thermal discomfort. Thermal discomfort, also termed thermal stress, corresponds to a dissatisfied state on the part of a person in terms of their thermal sensation, when exposed to extremely hot or cold thermal environments (ASHRAE 55, 2010; Teixeira et al., 2014). Thermal discomfort may be felt all over or in a particular part of the body (ASHRAE, 2001; Bluyssen et al., 2011; Yigit et al., 2015). This thermal state may reduce productive capacity or cognitive and physical performance, increasing the likelihood of fatigue and injury to workers and workplace accidents (ASHRAE, 2001; Bröde et al., 2013; Jackson and Rosenberg, 2010; Riniolo and Schmidt, 2006). Thus, extreme thermal stress is related to many work-related diseases associated with all categories of occupational disease, for example skin lesions, heat stroke, hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, heat syncope, heat rash, and human body collapse (ASHRAE, 2001; Jackson and Rosenberg, 2010). According to Cox (2005) a healthy environment can be found when the combined physical, chemical, and biological properties do not cause or aggravate any of the workers' diseases, ensuring high levels of comfort and contributing to the best performance in executing their functions or tasks. In this context, the scientific literature shows that research on the thermal environment in workstations is necessary, as individuals spend most of their time at work (Felix et al., 2010; Wisner, 1992). Thus, an understanding of the adaptation of individuals to the workstation and their reaction to different thermal environments is very important (Emmanuel, 2005). Furthermore, most of the studies in the scientific literature analyse work environments using thermal indexes, such as Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) (ISO 7243, 1989), Equivalent Temperature (ET) (Matzarakis et al., 1999), Relative Strain Index (RSI) (Lee and Henschel, 1963), Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) (Nieuwolt, 1977), Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD) (ISO 7730, 2006). PMV and PPD are examples of indexes which take into consideration the individual's thermal sensation, which would seem to suggest a better approach to a given thermal environment. However, according to the methodology applied in most case-studies reported in the literature, it is difficult to understand the thermal patterns of an indoor space using cheap and easy measuring tools which also take into account the thermal sensation of its occupants. In fact, the subjectivity associated with the thermal sensation concept hinders an objective analysis of thermal comfort that allows the creation of indoor spaces which satisfy most of the population who occupy them (Arezes et al., 2013; Bröde et al., 2013; De Giuli et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2014). It should be noted that the study of the thermal environment, instigated by Fanger (1972) and associated with ergonomics, is mainly considered as a corrective and reactive intervention because it is usually applied to existing situations. This paper aims to show the possibility of ascertaining the thermal patterns of industrial spaces and consequently identifying the most critical areas in terms of thermal comfort using thermal indexes supported by real data collected using inexpensive measuring tools. This study was carried out in two Portuguese industrial manufacturing facilities with different characteristics, evaluating the thermal environment and the workers' thermal sensation in the season of spring. The results were reproduced in colour maps based on MatLab algorithms, using the calculation formulas of three different thermal indexes – EsConTer, THI, and PPD. 2 Material and methods The present study was carried out in two Portuguese manufacturing industries with different characteristics, but both associated with heat thermal stress. The first industry (designated by IND_1) is a metalworking company that belongs to a giant German group with many companies all over the world. The second industry (designated by IND_2) is a family business associated with traditional glass production in Marinha Grande. In this section the methodology used in the present work will be briefly described, explaining the procedures followed to collect data, analyse information, and interpret the results. 2.1 Measurement of environmental parameters This study comprised measurements of environmental parameters and investigation of workers' subjective sensations in two different industrial facilities in spring. Firstly, in order to gather indoor environmental parameters, the layouts of both interior spaces were analysed with the purpose of identifying the observation points which were to be used to collect data. Fig. 1 presents the layout of the studied areas and the respective points of observation selected for IND_1 (on the left) and for IND_2 (on the right). These areas were selected according to the recommendations of the directors of the respective companies. In the layout, the x and y axes represent the dimensions of the study areas in metres (m), and the numbered circles represent the places where the measurement was made (i.e. the points of observation) in each case-study. As can be seen in Fig. 1, in IND_1 seventy-four points of observation were identified, seventy-two (from 1 to 72: blue circles) inside the study area, and two (73 and 74: grey circles) outside the study area; in IND_2 forty points of observation were identified, thirty-six inside the study area (from 1 to 36: blue circles) and four outside the study area (from 37 to 40: grey discs). The measurements outside of the study area were required because the thermal environment in the area under study is greatly influenced by the surrounding environment that lies just outside it. The measurements made at each point of observation were not taken at the same time due to measuring instrument restrictions. To collect measurements at all points at the same time, it would be necessary to have a sensor network or an expensive BABUC measuring instrument. In this project, accurate, calibrated, and cheap instruments were used which only collected data from one station at a time. Because of this, the observer had to make two symmetrical paths in order to understand the oscillations in the thermal pattern in the study areas during the period of measurement. In Fig. 1, the path (one way) is represented by the lines linking the points of observation inside the study areas. After confirming that no difference existed between the patterns of data collected in both directions (following two symmetrical consecutive paths), the data began to be collected based on one way only. Also, in the points of observation outside the study areas, data were collected right before and after each path. Data was collected with two similar measuring instruments, a Testo 435-4 and a Center 317- temperature humidity meter, with the aim of validating data collected and avoiding possible technological problems. These two instruments are multifunction gauges of air quality which allow the collection and storage of a wide range of thermal variables. At each point of observation, the measuring instruments were positioned in accordance with ISO 7726 (2001), 1.10 m above the floor. The measurements were made at two times, in the morning (around 10 a.m.) and in the afternoon (around 3 p.m.), in order to understand the influence of the diurnal cycle in the study areas. Concerning the environmental parameters collected, since thermal environment is characterized as a set of thermal variables surrounding a person which may influence her/him directly and/or indirectly (including air temperature, air velocity, relative humidity, among others), in this project data about air temperature – T (°C), relative humidity – RH (%), and wet-bulb temperature – WBT (%) was collected. To validate the data collected by the measuring instruments, the SPRUNG formula was applied, using the input values of T (°C) and RH (%) and obtaining the WBT (%). The relative error that occurred between measured value and calculated value of WBT was less than 0.5%. Furthermore, in order to authenticate the outdoor data collected from both industrial spaces, weather charts as well as air temperature and relative humidity graphics were downloaded from the Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) website These weather charts provided information about the meteorological elements in the regions where the study companies are located, in order to understand the behaviour of the atmosphere on each day of measurement. The air temperature and relative humidity graphics were crucial to compare the outdoor values collected during the study to the values gathered by meteorological stations, in order to validate the measuring instruments. 2.2 Thermal indexes to study the thermal patterns in indoor spaces Existing methods for thermal comfort evaluation often require sophisticated measuring instruments, which are not always accessible to a large proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises. In this study a new simplified model, EsConTer, will be presented, which has shown good results and in addition uses input parameters collected with cheap and easy-to-use measuring instruments. The EsConTer index, developed by Talaia and Simões (2009), has demonstrated its versatility and ease of application with regard to the analysis of thermal comfort (Morgado et al., 2015; Talaia et al., 2013; Teixeira et al., 2014). In order to validate the results of this new model, THI, a thermal index present in several studies related to thermal comfort, was applied. Additionally, the PPD index was also used, once its results had been aligned with the ASHRAE seven-point thermal sensation scale. EsConTer is a very recent thermal index which is presented in the form of a thermal scale (Ter) based on a colour scale (Es) that comprises the seven-point thermal sensation scale of ASHRAE 55 (ASHRAE 55, 2010) and considers the occupants' thermal sensation (Con). It uses air temperature and wet-bulb temperature as data inputs, and reproduces the results of the thermal pattern space, returning a dimensionless value in a range from −3 to 3, following the same scheme as the ASHRAE thermal sensation scale. The formula used to determine EsConTer is: (1) EsConTer = − 3.75 + 0.103 ( T a + T w ) where, T a (°C) is the air temperature and T w (%) the wet-bulb temperature. The ASHRAE thermal sensation scale is based on the heat balance of the human body, and represents human thermal perception through seven points: +3 (hot), +2 (warm), +1 (slightly warm), 0 (neutral), −1 (slightly cool), −2 (cool), −3 (cold). Considering the ASHRAE seven-point thermal sensation scale, the EsConTer index follows the same scheme, although it is represented by a colour scale from −3 to +3. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the darkest blue colour corresponds to −3, which means an extremely cold thermal sensation, while +3, represented by the darkest red colour, means an extremely hot thermal sensation. The other colours are linked to intermediate values, with 0 associated with a neutral thermal comfort sensation, equidistant to the colours at the extremes of the scale. The colour scale represented in Fig. 2 can also be used to investigate the thermal perception of the occupants of a specific environmental thermal space (that is, the workers' subjective sensations), allowing responses between two values, and not limited to only seven digits as with the ASHRAE thermal sensation seven-point scale. To validate the results of EsConTer index, the THI index was applied. The THI was created by Thom (1959) and later modified by Nieuwolt (Nieuwolt, 1977). Initially, using Thom's approach, this index was calculated from wet-bulb temperature and air temperature, but Nieuwolt modified it, replacing wet-bulb temperature with relative humidity. This change was made in order to facilitate the implementation and evaluation of the index. The formula used to determine THI is: (2) THI = 0.75 T a + T a ( RH 500 ) where T a is the air temperature (°C) and RH the relative humidity (%). Considering the subjectivity associated with thermal comfort, there are different intervals in the literature to support the interpretation of this index. The present study followed the THI limits adopted by Talaia et al. (Talaia et al., 2013), as shown in Table 1 . Other widely used models which evaluate thermal sensation are the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD). The first of these, PMV, was created by Fanger (Fanger, 1972) and predicts the mean response in terms of thermal comfort of a larger group of people exposed to certain thermal conditions over a long period of time (Castilla et al., 2011), according to the ASHRAE thermal sensation scale. The PPD index, meanwhile, is a quantitative measure of the thermal comfort of a group of people which represents the percentage of individuals dissatisfied when exposed to certain thermal conditions. According to ISO 7730 (2006), the formula for calculating the PPD index is given by: (3) PPD = 100 − 95 e [ − ( 0.03353 P M V 4 + 0.2179 P M V 2 ) ] In an ideal situation and regarding Liang and Du (2005) and ASHRAE (ASHRAE, 2001), a PMV equal to zero is expected, combining optimal hygrometric and personal parameters. Nevertheless this scenario is impossible to achieve, as it requires 100% of the individuals in a group to feel satisfied by the surrounding thermal conditions. Addressing this reflection, it was therefore necessary to employ the admissible limits used by the PMV and PPD indexes to characterize an area as a comfort zone, namely (ISO 7730, 2006): - A category: PPD < 6% and −0.2 < PMV<+0.2; - B category: PPD < 10% and −0.5 < PMV<+0.5; - C category: PPD < 15% and −0.7 < PMV<+0.7. The PMV-PPD model presents an empirical relationship between the percentage of people dissatisfied (PPD) with a thermal environment using a function of the PMV. The PMV index is based on the heat balance of the human body, and therefore its calculation is not easy and to apply directly. In the present study, the PPD formula was modified, with the PMV input value replaced by the EsConTer value, as shown Equation (4). (4) PPD = 100 − 95 e [ − ( 0.03353 E s C o n T e r 4 + 0.2179 E s C o n T e r 2 ) ] 2.3 Matlab algorithms and colour maps With the aim of facilitating the processing analysis and the interpretation of the results, the three indexes used in this work – THI, EsConTer, and PPD – were programmed in MatLab. Firstly, the data collected using measuring instruments, specifically the air temperature, relative humidity and the wet-bulb temperature, was organized in Microsoft Excel. Next, the MatLab algorithm (i) read the input data present in the Microsoft Excel; (ii) calculated the average value for each point of observation, using different measurements taken at each local point; and consequently (iii) reproduced the results of each variable (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) or index (e.g., THI, EsConTer, PPD), according to a statistical method which minimizes the squared error between two observation points. Based on this data, the MatLab algorithm generated the colour maps, in order to facilitate interpretation of the results produced by the indexes or variables. In the present practical cases, the generated colour maps represent the average pattern of (1) air temperature, (2) relative humidity, (3) THI index, (4) EsConTer index, and (5) PPD index. In each of the maps, the colour scale on the right side represents the range of possible values for each variable or index under study, with the respective colour pattern. The x and y axes represent the dimensions of the study areas in metres (m), mapping the data onto the industry layouts. On the basis of the generated colour maps, it is possible to apply a specific zoom algorithm to easily identify the most critical areas, i.e., the most uncomfortable areas regarding thermal discomfort. Additionally, other maps regarding the average thermal pattern with standard deviation were also created, using specific algorithms in MatLab, thereby displaying the situation closest to the most uncomfortable scenario experienced during the period of the study. 2.4 Measurement of workers' thermal sensation Another important aspect used to evaluate thermal environments in an indoor space is the investigation of the thermal sensation of its occupants. Human thermal perception stems from thermal sensation, a reaction of the human body caused by the surrounding environment (Yao et al., 2009). Thermal sensation is influenced by several factors which affect the response of a person when exposed to a specific environment. These factors can be grouped in two categories: personal factors (characteristics of the occupants, such as metabolic rate and clothing insulation), and environmental factors (conditions of the thermal environment, including air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed, and relative humidity). Regarding personal factors, these can differ from person to person, which justifies the subjectivity that is usually associated with thermal sensation. This concept has mainly been studied through surveys which draw on the ASHRAE seven-point thermal sensation scale, where the respondents indicate which one of the seven values of this scale best corresponds to their real thermal sensation at the time they are surveyed (Liu et al., 2012; Chow et al., 2010). As mentioned previously, the EsConTer index was used to predict the occupants' thermal sensation. After identifying the critical areas in terms of thermal comfort, based on the methodology described above, all the people who work at workstations located in these areas were surveyed using a thermal sensation colour scale (see Fig. 2). The anthropometric data for the subjects involved are listed in Table 2 . The study was approved by IND_1 Ethical Board and by IND_2 Ethical Board, and all subjects involved were informed and their consents were obtained. Workers were asked to respond with a tag at the position that best corresponded to their thermal sensation at the time they were surveyed. Training in filling out the survey was given to the workers before its application. In order to compare the thermal sensation with the thermal environment and to measure worker's predicted thermal sensation, air temperature and relative humidity data were also collected from the workstation at the time of inquiry, using the Testo 435-4 measuring instruments. The surveys and measurements were made at four times during the day: in the morning at 10 a.m. and 12 a.m., and in the afternoon at 2–3 p.m. and 4–5 p.m., at all critical workstations (five in IND_1 and eight in IND_2). These measurements at different times were done in order to understand the influence of the diurnal solar cycle on workers' thermal sensation during the day. Moreover, from the real thermal sensation and thermal environment variables, it was possible to perform measurements to validate the approximation of real data to the EsConTer index (predicted thermal sensation). 3 Results and discussion The present section shows the results obtained in each industry studied, and their discussion. Initially, using colour maps, the average thermal pattern in the industrial spaces for spring will be presented, as well as the most uncomfortable workplaces in each studied space. Next, to understand the extremes in terms of thermal pattern in the period under analysis, colour maps showing the mean values plus standard deviation were generated. Finally, some discussion about the role of the EsConTer index in revealing thermal patterns in industrial interior spaces and in predicting their occupants' thermal sensation will also be presented. 3.1 Thermal pattern of industrial spaces and the identification of the most critical workplaces Fig. 3 represents the average pattern of the air temperature and relative humidity variables for IND_1, using the colour maps generated by MatLab algorithms. The colour scale on the right side of each representation shows the range of possible values for each variable. For example, in the case of the air temperature, the values for the studied space range from 19.5 °C (minimum) to 25 °C (maximum). For the relative humidity, the range of values is from 43% (minimum) to 54% (maximum). The x and y axes represent the dimensions of the spaces in metres, mapping the data onto the industry layouts. As expected, the regions affected by higher air temperatures are the regions affected by lower relative humidity values. Fig. 4 presents the results of the THI and EsConTer indexes for IND_1, based on colour maps that are in agreement with the results reported by Fig. 3. In the representations the darkest red colour corresponds to the most uncomfortable area, associated with higher thermal heat stress. Comparing the results reported in Fig. 3 with those of Fig. 4, it is possible to verify that the same critical area is suggested. Both of the indexes represented in Fig. 4 are in agreement, since the thermal lines designated in these maps almost coincide. Indeed, the values obtained with the application of THI and EsConTer reveal a significant correlation coefficient of 0.963. The five black circles on the colour maps represent the most critical workstations of permanent workers, when the zoom algorithm was applied. These workstations are manual and automatic welding stations, oven entrances, and assembly stations near hot bath stations, and are affected by thermal environments of between 21.5 °C and 22.5 °C, according to the THI, and between 0.5 and 0.7 according to the EsConTer index. Fig. 5 represents the PPD index, showing the percentage of unsatisfied individuals in this interior space. On this scale, dissatisfaction levels for the selected workstations are between 14% and 16%. Compared with the PMV-PPD model, this result shows a curious agreement between EsConTer-PPD (where PMV is replaced by EsConTer) and PMV-PPD. According to the PMV-PPD model (ISO 7730 (2006), the scenario represented falls under category C limits, i.e., it is at the border of the comfort zone. The colour maps reflecting the average pattern of air temperature and relative humidity for IND_2 are presented in Fig. 6 . As in the case of IND_1, the areas affected by higher temperatures are the areas with lower relative humidity values. So, this area, affected by 28°C–30 °C and 35%–40% is considered the most critical region regarding thermal discomfort. As this area is occupied by work machinery (industrial ovens), it is not considered a working area. The colour maps relating to THI and EsConTer are represented in Fig. 7 . Once again, regarding Fig. 7, both thermal indexes seem to be in agreement because of the concordance of their thermal lines. In terms of thermal index interpretation, the most critical areas, coloured in red, are under thermal discomfort. THI values are between 24 °C and 26 °C (wind needed for comfort), and EsConTer values are around 1.0 and 1.4 (slightly warm to warm). It is noted that the identified workstations do not coincide exactly with the areas affected by the highest levels of thermal stress because some of the areas in this industry are free from occupied workstations, representing the positions of machines where nobody works continuously. However, the selected workstations, represented by the eight black circles and defined by the zoom algorithm, are the closest workplaces to this area. These workstations are affected by thermal environments of between 21 °C and 24 °C, according to the THI, and between 0.4 and 1.0 according to the EsConTer index. These workstations are hot cutting stations, working areas near oven entrances (where glass is removed with a rod), and presses. Fig. 8 represents the PPD index, showing the percentage of dissatisfied individuals in this inner space of IND_2. The PPD index is also in agreement with EsConTer (PMV) due to its concordance with the PMV-PPD model. So, regarding these results, in some workstations the thermal environment is at the limit of slight thermal stress, suggesting a percentage of workers dissatisfaction, under these conditions, of between 10% and 30%. 3.2 The thermal pattern closest to the most uncomfortable scenario The colour maps that represent IND_1's average thermal patterns plus standard deviation, which characterize the closest scenario to the most uncomfortable environment during the study period, can been seen in Figs. 9 and 10 . As expected, these colour maps represent greater thermal discomfort, as in both the THI and the EsConTer indexes the values rise, to over 24 °C and 1.0 respectively. Once again, THI and EsConTer index behaviour concurred, as well as the relationship between the EsConTer and PPD indexes. Under these thermal environment conditions, the percentage of dissatisfied occupants rose to around 22%. Fig. 11 represents the average thermal pattern plus standard deviation of the interior space of IND_2. As expected, the thermal pattern in Fig. 11 suggests greater thermal discomfort than that revealed in Fig. 7; nevertheless, both indexes are also in agreement. The most critical area showed in these colour maps, represented by red shading, indicates the position of the industrial oven. Fig. 12 represents the PPD thermal pattern plus standard deviation. Beyond the picture revealed by direct measurement, this figure shows a higher percentage of dissatisfied occupants (around 20%–40%) than the scenario shown in Fig. 8, as expected, due to the warmer thermal pattern found through the inclusion of standard deviation. 3.3 The simplicity of the EsConTer index in revealing thermal patterns of industrial interior spaces The EsConTer index was demonstrably in agreement with THI, taking into account the correlation that was found in the colour maps generated in both case-studies, IND_1 and IND_2. The correlation coefficient between these two thermal indexes is very near to 1, which shows that EsConTer is a good index for predicting the thermal pattern in an indoor space. Moreover, from the colour maps applied to both indexes it was possible to identify the most critical areas, i.e., the most uncomfortable areas in terms of thermal environment. Thus, the colour maps seemed to provide an easy and intuitive way to interpret the thermal patterns of indoor spaces, allowing the observer to identify the most uncomfortable areas in order to prompt faster corrective actions. Figs. 13 and 14 are examples of measurements over the course of one day, where the indoor and outdoor thermal environment changes in both industries can be viewed. The internal EsConTer represents the thermal environment in the interior space (indoor measurements), and the external EsConTer represents the thermal environment outside the studied indoor spaces (outdoor measurements). Comparing the two scenarios, it is possible to verify that the thermal pattern of IND_2 is warmer than that of IND_1. Also, the indoor space of IND_2 showed a less consistent thermal pattern than IND_1. This situation is due to the industrial context of the two facilities, and is perhaps related to IND_1 having different infrastructure (walls, roof, and insulation) to IND_2. Comparing the evolution of the internal and external EsConTer values in both areas studied, it is possible to confirm the influence of the external environment on the inner spaces in terms of thermal pattern. The thermal environment of the inner space followed variations in the outdoor environment: as the external EsConTer approaches 0 (the value that represents optimal comfort), the internal EsConTer rises and becomes more uncomfortable. Regarding the diurnal cycle, it was interesting to observe the kind of greenhouse effect that occurs in both indoor spaces, mainly right after noon. Because of this phenomenon, the thermal discomfort gradually increases over time, reaching peak discomfort at around 5 p.m. for both industries. Given that EsConTer index results are based on the ASHRAE seven-point thermal sensation scale, this index surprisingly demonstrated itself capable of predicting the PMV index, even taking into account different input parameters. As a result, use of the EsConTer index is also suggested for predicting the workers' thermal sensation. 3.4 EsConTer index as a tool to predict thermal sensation of the occupants of interior spaces Figs. 15 and 16 , like Figs. 13 and 14, show the indoor and outdoor thermal environment, represented by internal EsConTer and external EsConTer, with the addition of the workers' subjective thermal sensations, collected using the thermal sensation colour scale. Five workers in IND_1 and eight workers in IND_2 voluntarily participated in this experiment (see Table 2). Through Figs. 15 and 16, the correlation between internal EsConTer (environmental parameters collected using measuring instruments) and workers' thermal sensation (subjective thermal sensation collected using the thermal sensation colour scale) can be visualized. The two variables have a correlation coefficient of 0.9316; thus, EsConTer also reliably predicts workers' actual thermal sensation, confirming the results of the EsConTer-PPD. Beyond that, it is also possible to visualize the unequivocal subjectivity associated with thermal sensation, as under the same environment workers clearly show different thermal sensations. Moreover, as expected, the workers' thermal sensation in IND_2 is more inconsistent than in IND_1, showing that even workers' thermal sensation follows environmental thermal changes in time. In general terms, and considering the results of the study described, it is possible to conclude that the methodology applied in this work represents a good model for thermal stress risk evaluation, minimizing the need for difficult and time-consuming investigations to identify thermal comfort problems in workplaces. The colour maps generated by MatLab algorithms also proved to be a useful tool for visualizing the thermal pattern of an indoor environment, and consequently produced useful information for solving thermal comfort problems. 4 Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate the capability of predicting the average thermal pattern of an industrial inner space and identifying the most critical areas affected by thermal environments, using a simplified model based on the EsConTer index. Indeed, all the results confirmed that the EsConTer index is in agreement with the THI as well as with the PMV, insofar as the PMV-PPD model is aligned with the EsConTer-PPD. Additionally, the EsConTer index was also in agreement with workers' actual thermal sensation, suggesting its capacity to accurately predict the thermal sensation of the occupants of indoor spaces. The EsConTer index measurements only made use of digital measuring instruments (Testo 435-4 and Center 317- temperature humidity meter) and the thermal sensation colour scale; this shows that thermal environment studies can be performed using inexpensive instruments, and for this reason it should be applicable in industries and other workplaces. Neither of the industrial facilities (IND_1 and IND_2) where this study was performed had thermal environment control tools as part of their everyday practices, although the results were appreciated by the Health and Safety Department of each industry in order to develop measures that might improve the occupational health of the occupants of these spaces to prevent work accidents and work-related disorders. Additionally, the colour maps seemed a useful and intuitive means of highlighting the most vulnerable areas as well as the dynamic of the thermal environment in an interior space, thus offering an easy reading and interpretation tool for any decision-maker. So, regarding the information from such colour maps and workers' thermal sensation given by the EsConTer index, work-related disorders may be minimized through corrective actions which take results from this index into consideration. In this sense, corrective actions, including adjusting thermal environment conditions, workers' exposure time to such environments, and the type of tasks/functions/movements developed in the workplaces in such areas, should be applied in order to avoid possible work-related disorders. Accordingly, the methodology applied in this work offers a sound model for thermal stress risk evaluation, minimizing difficult and time-consuming investigations to identify thermal comfort problems in workplaces. The coloured maps generated by MatLab algorithms proved to be a useful tool to visualize the thermal pattern of an environment, and consequently produce useful information for solving thermal comfort problems. The study results are positive and also very important as they constitute the first data in this topic. However, it should be noted that the data was collected for just one season (spring) as well as the small sample involved in the experiment, present some limitations. To address these limitations, long-term studies with larger sample size are needed. Thus future work is suggested which takes into account all the seasons of the year, and defines the thermal pattern for each season in order to trigger faster corrective measures, for better work and safety conditions. The application of the present methodology is further proposed in other industrial contexts and in cold thermal environments to understand the behaviour of the thermal indexes used under those conditions. A study focused on workers' thermal sensation, regarding personal variables such as clothing insulation (clo), metabolism, gender, or age, and productivity and quality indexes are other long-term goals regarding the utilization of the EsConTer index. Conflict of interest statement The authors point out that there was no conflict of interest when doing this research in an industrial environment. The sole purpose is to contribute to the improvement of scientific knowledge.

All rights reserved.Knowledge management is defined by different authors as the process that enables the sharing, capture and application of knowledge from the individual to the group and further to organizational level. The organizational atomization observed in the academia imposes importance in paying attention to a culture that encourages knowledge management and also assigns equal importance to the cooperation and the work in team. However, due to the different levels of heterogeneity among and within these organizations there is not just one model that fits well. Through a literature review on the knowledge management in the academia, the purpose of this chapter is an exploratory study that identifies the main cultural challenges in the development and implementation of a knowledge management system in the academic context.",

An effective evaluation during development not only promotes the quality of the final solution, but also ensures motivated users, error-free systems, and can even establish good practices to minimize costs in future developments. However, the HIS evaluation is a difficult process due to the complex nature of the health care domain, the objects being evaluated, as well as the comprehensiveness of the concept of the evaluation itself. The present work intends to explore, based on a literature review, the main methods of HIS evaluation to support the development, identifying in which stage of the SDLC these methods can be applied. Additionally, this work discusses the reasons for the evaluation of such systems, illustrating these issues with two real case studies of HIS implementations, in which some of the methods were successfully applied.",

Computer software to assist the NPR is crucial, as it facilitates the introduction of the data from a national universe that will be centralized and merged into a unique location, thus ensuring a greater reliability and accuracy of the collected data, avoiding duplication of patients. In Portugal, despite the efforts and recognition of the need of a NPR, just recently the protocol for the establishment of the computer software to support the Portuguese National Registry of Haemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies (PorR H&CC) was approved. This paper aims to present this newly developed computerized solution, as well as to report the main variables and information that will be available. The development of this application, which includes a set of socio-demographic, clinical and treatment data, was based on the principles of WFH, and the database that supports the NPR, with anonymized data, is operated and maintained in accordance with the Data Protection Law. Currently, the first data are available on the application. Our focus now is to ensure more registries and continuous data entry in order to have complete information on the characterization of the haemophilia patient population in Portugal.",

Data were collected based on a questionnaire applied to 234 students from the University of Aveiro (Portugal) and the results were analysed by using descriptive analysis, paired samples t-tests, cluster analyses and Kruskal–Wallis tests. The results show that the tools most used by students in a learning context are video sharing, social network sites and wikis, and that in a leisure context students use social network sites and video sharing more. The profiles of the groups resulting from the cluster analyses reveal that 42% of the students do not use Web 2.0 tools intensively in either one of the contexts. However, findings from comparing the clusters of both contexts show that students who more frequently use the tools in the leisure context are occasional users in the learning context and vice versa. This study contributes to a better knowledge of the student profiles concerning the use of Web 2.0 tools in learning and leisure contexts which can help teachers direct their strategies to the use of the most appropriate tools, thus improving the success of the teaching-learning process.",

In general, the professors expressed a positive attitude towards the items that measure the Perceived Ease of Use, the Perceived Usefulness, the Attitude Toward Using and the Social Influence. There were defined groups of professors based on gender, scientific area and age group, and statistical tests were performed. Although the majority of the items did not show any statistical significant differences between the groups, probably revealing that the use of Moodle is already widespread in the teaching and learning process at UA, it was possible to identify some differences, mainly with respect to gender and scientific area.",

To help the companies with becoming and/or remaining more competitive, management and production planning requires more and more prompt and effective decisions, in order to increase the productivity and reduce the production costs. This work presents a mobile application, developed for an Android system that was implemented and tested in a Portuguese company. This application allows the recording and storage of data, with the main objective of supporting production planning and control. In addition to the development, implementation and testing of the application, a study of the usability impact of the application by the company was also made, not only in terms of production process optimization as well as the feasibility of its use by human resources.",

All rights reserved.This paper describes a web application designed to support the first national registry of patients with haemophilia and other congenital coagulopathies in Portugal. The importance of national patient registry systems (nPRS), in the scope of the treatment of the chronic and rare diseases such as haemophilia, has been recognized by several institutions at an international level and by national government entities. However, there are several barriers to the creation of such systems, in particular due to the lack of motivation to invest in order to benefit only a small proportion of the population, a characteristic of rare diseases. The conditions for the creation of the first Portuguese nPRS in the field of haemophilia were recently created through a joint project between a group of medical professionals belonging to the Portuguese Association of Coagulopathies Congenital (APCC) and a group of researchers from the University of Aveiro. Currently, the technological solution is already developed, tested, and installed at the data centre of the University of Aveiro. Its operational version is being used by clinicians of different Haemophilia Treatment Centres (HTCs) around the country. The data inserted accounts for about 10% of the Portuguese population with haemophilia and all entities involved are working towards achieving 100% of this population.

        "doc_abstract": "© 2016 The Authors.Nowadays, due to globalization, business diversification and a growing number of different business projects, the need to support people involved in tasks related to project management is becoming increasingly important. Timely and accurate data about projects' plans, their progress and related costs, are extremely important for project managers and consequently for assuring the success of the project. In this context, Project Management Information Systems (PMIS) are commonly viewed as an important tool for project management. However, this kind of Information Systems (IS) is relatively expensive and therefore out of reach for many small and medium enterprises (SME) that often choose not to use them. As a way to overcome this situation many consulting companies decide to invest in the development of their own PMIS. This paper presents the design process of an Information System for Project Management, whose main purpose is to manage investment projects throughout their life cycle. The system supports all the application process for incentive programs, as well as the documentation and procedures required, and helps to manage the project itself, when it is approved. This solution will thus contribute to the improvement of the performance of the Projects & Incentives' division of the consulting company, but can also be replicated by other companies that have similar needs.",

Nowadays, due to globalization, business diversification and a growing number of different business projects, the need to support people involved in tasks related to project management is becoming increasingly important. Timely and accurate data about projects’ plans, their progress and related costs, are extremely important for project managers and consequently for assuring the success of the project. In this context, Project Management Information Systems (PMIS) are commonly viewed as an important tool for project management. However, this kind of Information Systems (IS) is relatively expensive and therefore out of reach for many small and medium enterprises (SME) that often choose not to use them. As a way to overcome this situation many consulting companies decide to invest in the development of their own PMIS. This paper presents the design process of an Information System for Project Management, whose main purpose is to manage investment projects throughout their life cycle. The system supports all the application process for incentive programs, as well as the documentation and procedures required, and helps to manage the project itself, when it is approved. This solution will thus contribute to the improvement of the performance of the Projects & Incentives’ division of the consulting company, but can also be replicated by other companies that have similar needs.

The design of such a system is complex and entails several interconnected problems. The decision process regarding the design of CMS must, therefore, be sustained by solid data and supported by adequate models capable of helping the decision maker in the development of an adequate solution. In this context, a Decision Support System (DSS) for the design of CMS is being developed, and the purpose of this work is to present the conceptualization of the database required for such DSS.",

Tel.: +351-234-370361; fax: +351-234-370215. In Cellular Manufacturing Systems (CMS) resources are grouped to create independent cells capable of completely processing a set of similar parts. The design of such a system is complex and entails several interconnected problems. The decision process regarding the design of CMS must, therefore, be sustained by solid data and supported by adequate models capable of helping the decision maker in the development of an adequate solution. In this context, a Decision Support System (DSS) for the design of CMS is being developed, and the purpose of this work is to present the conceptualization of the database required for such DSS.

Currently the improvement of Internal Logistics processes is a key factor for delivering products to customers on time and at a competitive price. There is an increasing need for eliminating non-value added tasks and reducing operating costs. In this context, the synchronization of supply routes is very important in order to create standards and improve the use of resources. The purpose of this study is to describe the way Logistics Scenarios were developed in an industrial environment and also to show the importance of Internal Logistics.",

Additionally, this article presents an experience of the development of a web-based application that aims to manage the clinical information in haemophilia care, which benefited from these practices, making use of some methods to support the collaboration and communication between designers, users, and developers. The results of our experience show that the hybrid approach, that combines the principles of UCD with values of ASD can help to integrate human factors into the software development process in a highly complex environment, characterized by missing information, shifting goals and a great deal of uncertainty, such as the healthcare field.",

This paper aims to study a manufacturing industry inner space affected by heat thermal environments in order to identify the most critical areas regarding two thermal indexes, EsConTer and THI, in which their interpretations valorize workers thermal sensation. From the color maps developed to facilitate indexes analysis the most critical areas of the space in study were easily identified as well as the most critical workstations near those areas. The health and safety department of the industry in study valorized the results in order to develop measures that may improve the occupational health of the occupants due to the approximation of the indexes results to workers thermal sensation.",

The opinion of employees is, nowadays, an important factor to consider because their perception may be related to their behavior. The satisfaction of all individuals housed in a thermal environment is an “almost” impossible task because a thermally comfortable environment for one person may be uncomfortable for another. Therefore, it would be ideal to create a thermal environment that satisfied the largest number of workers. As such, the evaluation of thermal comfort implies a certain degree of subjectivity and requires the analysis of two aspects: physical (thermal environment) and subjective (state of mind of the individual). This study aims to analyze the pattern of thermal sensation of a packaging section of quick-frozen desalted codfish, discover the location of the most vulnerable workstations to thermal stress and assess the real thermal sensation of workers. The data were collected using a measurement instrument named “Center 317—temperature humidity meter”. For the analysis of thermal sensation the follow indexes were applied: Temperature Humidity Index (THI), Thermal Comfort Scale (EsConTer) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). A set of standards were created for each variable and the results obtained indicate the most vulnerable workstations. Intervention strategies were considered.",

Introduction According to the report of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), an important measure for improving the management of Hemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies (HoCC) is the existence of patientsâ€™ registries, which, in a national context, could lead to the National Patientsâ€™ Registries (NPR) with HoCC [1]. The vision of the WFH with 'Treatment for All' is that all people that suffer with HoCC must have access to medical care and appropriate treatments. For this, the identification of all patients who suffer with this disease represents the first step, being the NPR the fundamental tool for such identification [2]. Registries of patients have the invaluable potential to provide an understanding of the disorder, to provide useful information for planning health care services and to identify suitable groups of patients for clinical trials enrolment [3]. This kind of registries are particularly useful for people suffering with rare and chronic diseases, such as HoCC, where important research questions cannot be answered without a set of information about the prevalence and evolution of the disease. Registries for rare diseases are broadly accepted for their usefulness in monitoring the identification and diagnosis of people with hemophilia (PWH) and evaluating their health. The purpose of a Registry in the context of HoCC is to define the population demographics and collect observational data on specific hemophilia health concerns such as the prevalence of viral infections, factor inhibitors, implementation of prophylaxis, and track the usage of the products (drugs). In addition to the demographic characterization of the population with hemophilia, the existence of those records allows the collection of data for statistical analysis related to the specificity of the disease, such as the prevalence of viral infections, existence of inhibitor factors, implementation of prophylactic treatments, joint evaluation, among other mechanisms to assist the decision making process. Given the importance of these data for disease management, the consistent definition of this data, its correct storage and possibility of subsequent extraction of information are important factors for a more objective view of the practice of hemophilia care, with a profound impact on the health and in the quality of life of these patients. The lack of a National Patients Registry for Hemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopatias in Portugal, associated with the difficulty that clinicians of this area faced in order to manage the specific patient information, motivated a group of physicians to seek for a technological solution that facilitated and optimized the information management process. This article presents the newly developed web-based solution to support the Portuguese National Hemophilia Registry, whose project arose from a joint initiative between the hemophilia healthcare professionals, represented by the Portuguese Association of Congenital Coagulopathies (PACC) and a group of researchers from the University of Aveiro (UA) responsible for analyzing, developing and implementing the technological solution. 2. Registry and its role in chronic and rare diseases Registry is defined in epidemiology as a data file with information efficiently recoverable, related with elements that are important for health in a defined population in such a way that the registered elements can be extrapolated to a base population [4]. In the scope of congenital bleeding disorders, the registry is a database of people identified with this disease including information on personal details, diagnosis, treatment and complications [1], [5]. The registry is thus a key tool for identifying and tracking individuals with a particular disease, and consequently for quality control and quality assurance in treatment, and for studying the impact of new developments on prevention, diagnosis and treatments [6]. These registries contain demographical, social and clinical data, categorized in diagnose, treatment and follow-up data. The WFH recommends that this data be stored in a centralized unique national repository, as, among other benefits, avoids patient duplication, ensuring a greater reliability of registries in order to portray a faithful reality of the disease in a country [1]. Given the usefulness of these systems, there are several countries that have already implemented NPR in the context of Hemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies. Considering the results the results of a study published by Oâ€™Mahony et al. in 2012 [7], that was based in an inquiry made in 35 European countries, there are 27 countries with NPR and 8 without a NPR, a group where Portugal was included. In the countries with a NPR, not all have the information openly available, and some of them are reported in the literature, as the NPR from Austria [6], Italy [6], Spain [8], Poland [9], Switzerland [10], United Kingdom [11], 1250 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1248 â€“ 1255 Germany [12]. Other NPR are referred in the work of other authors as is the cases of NPR from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Finland, Greece, Russia, and Slovakia [7]. Outside European continent, there are other reference NPR in this area, as is the case as the NPR from Canada [13]. 3. The Web-application to support the Portuguese National Registry for Hemophilia This work aims to present the web-application to support a National Registry of Hemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies in Portugal. The analysis, conception and development of the platform that would support NPR with HoCC in Portugal was a joint initiative between the Portuguese Association of Congenital Coagulopathies (PACC) and a group of researchers from the University of Aveiro (UA). The PACC is a non-profit organization represented by a group of health care providers in the area of HoCC, and the entity responsible for defining the rules, guidelines and setting goals for the NPR. The University of Aveiro was the part responsible for the technology leadership, more specifically for the analysis, conception, implementation and maintenance and support of the NPR of HoCC platform. 3.1. Disease characterization and problem contextualization Hemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor [2]. According to the WFHâ€™s annual global surveys, the number of PWH in the world is approximately 400 000, affecting the population in a ratio of 1 case for 10,000 people born [5]. Portugal is a country with 10 million inhabitants and about 1000 PWH are expected. However, the number of the other cases with Congenital Coagulopathies, including the vonWillebrand disease (vWB) and other type of deficiencies of factors, does increase this value. To treat these patients, there are different treatment centers scattered through Portugal, and despite the efforts and recognition of the need of a NPR, just recently the protocol for the creation of the system to support the Registry was approved. For this project, the establishment of an expert working group was endorsed, involving a group of physicians and a group of researchers in the field of computer science, aiming to develop the first Web-based platform to support the NPR for HoCC in Portugal. 3.2. Methodology of Development The development process of the web-platform (named hemo@record) followed an iterative and incremental process, which allowed the requirement elicitation and its validation with a group of clinicians, future users of the system [14]. Information collected in this phase was incorporated into a detailed specifications document to guide development, using an object-oriented (OO) environment. After this phase, a detailed description of the registry was submitted to the National Committee for Data Protection in March 2013 and consent for the registry was obtained two months later. The guidelines of the National Data Protection Agency on confidentiality were carefully followed along the development process of the technological solution and the web-based application that supports the NPR for HoCC in Portugal is operated and maintained in accordance with the Data Protection Law. The data will be collected in the application after consent of the patient. 3.3. Brief Description of the technological solution developed The hemo@record was developed to store and manage a set of anonymous data from patients with HoCC, and to be used by clinicians that treat people with this disease scattered over the country. There are two different profiles of users (actors) with access credentials to use the system, namely: Âƒ Physician - it includes the doctors that treat PWH and have permission to perform a set of tasks, including introduction, update, deletion of their patient's data, as well as, query and visualize information (with some critical data hidden), from all the patients at national level; Âƒ Coordinator â€“ it is also a doctor with administration permissions, having access to all the functionalities of the system. 1251 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1248 â€“ 1255 Each patient has his/her personal data hidden and is identified by an anonymous code, having associated a set of records that reflects his/her clinical history in terms of health through time. To provide an efficient set of functionalities to the users, the system is organized through a set of 8 modules, managing demographic, clinical and treatment data (see Fig.1). Fig.1 - Snapshot of modules present in hemo@care (user interfaces in Portuguese). Âƒ Two of those modules are statistical modules, presenting a set of statistical indicators, at national and local level; Âƒ Six modules providing data management functionalities (insert, update, delete, export): Modules for administration and audit purposes (available to the coordinator only), and modules for patient management, registry management, treatments management and death management. Modules to visualize national and local statistics The national statistics module was designed to present a set of national indicators, reflecting the current situation, encompassing the data from all the patients introduced in the system by their doctors. These indicators provide a complete analysis of the national situation, namely: (i) distribution of patients per area of residence; (ii) distribution of patients per Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) or Hospital; (iii) distribution of patients per type of coagulopathy; (iv) distribution of patients per type of treatment; (v) distribution of patients per severity of disease; (vi) distribution of patients per treatment regimen; (vii) evolution in the number of occurrences; and, (viii) evolution in the number of deaths. The local statistics module presents the same indicators, with the exception of those that identify the geographic location of the patient, such as: â€˜distribution of patients by place of residenceâ€™ and â€˜distribution of patients per HTC or Hospital (see Fig.2) Fig.2 - Snapshot of user interface with indicators of local statistics module (interfaces in Portuguese). 1252 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1248 â€“ 1255 In a nutshell, the difference between these two modules is that the former present all the national data, while the later only presents the local data associated with the user HTC. Each statistics module is presented in a specific chart (pie chart, bar chart, etc.) that is appropriate to the type of data that is provided by the module (see examples in Fig.3). Distribution of patients by type of coagulopathy Distribution of patients by HTC/ Hospital Evolution in the number of occurrences Fig.3 - Snapshots with examples of some indicators (in Portuguese with fictitious data). Modules to manage patientsâ€™ data The remaining six modules provide the information to manage all patient data. The first step to use the web-application is the introduction of the patient basic data, i.e., the anonymous and unique patient code, complemented with a set of demographical data as gender, HTC or Hospital, data of birth, place and country of birth, and place and country of residence, (Figure 4 - left side). The patient is introduced only once, the system having an automatic process that identifies possible duplications, triggering automatic mechanisms for alerting the Coordinator. After registering the patient, it is possible to introduce registries for that patient. Each registry stores the patient's health condition at a specific instant of time, more specifically the clinical condition or/and the social and life quality information. To be able to assess the evaluation through time, each time a change on a given situation or medical condition occurs; the system automatically creates a new record. As such, each patient can have several registries, and through the analysis off all the records, is possible to determine the evolution of the patient's health condition, social and quality of life evolution. The system presents patients listings in a proprietary grid view, using a color representation in order to promptly identify different situations, like patients without associated registries, patients that belong to the same HTC as the physician, patients already diseased, etc. (Figure 4 - right side). Fig.4 - Snapshot of some aspects of the user interface (in Portuguese with fictitious data). 1253 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1248 â€“ 1255 Due to the laws of privacy and data protection, the identifying data of patients from other HTC's (anonymous code and hospital name), are hidden. As can be seen in Fig.4 (right side), there are several functionalities that can be performed after selecting a patient, such as: create or update patient's registries, create or update patient treatment details (treatment date, drug name and consumed dosage). To facilitate the statistical analysis and detect trends, the data can be exported to a Microsoft Excel format for posterior analysis. All the grids provide powerful filter and sorting mechanisms, having each field a specific filter system adapted to the type of data hosted in that field (for example, a date field allows to filter dates within a chosen interval, etc.). The system also provides a complete solution to manage the details of the patient treatments, according to the rules imposed by the WFH such as: create or update data about Coagulation Factor Concentrate (CFC) products (drugs used in Hemophilia treatments), create or update suppliers, create or update patient consumption details, etc. Fig.5 (left side) presents the example of interface that allows to record a patient's treatment details, while Fig.5 (right side) shows all the treatments presented on the system proprietary grid, providing the same powerful filtering and sorting mechanisms. Fig.5 - Snapshot of some aspects of the user nterfaces (in Portuguese with fictitious data). 3.4 . Technological Solution From a technological standpoint, the hemo@record web-application was developed using the Spring development Framework, a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Enterprise Java applications [15]. The advantage of using the Spring framework is that it handles the infrastructure support details, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of the system. The Web frontend was developed using Sencha GXT, a Java-based framework for building feature-rich web-applications based on GWT. â€œGXT features high- performance user interfaces (UI) widgets that are interoperable with native GWT components, templates, and layout managerâ€� [16]. GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive development of high-performance web- applications without the need to be an expert on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. Using GWT, the cross-browser inconsistency is eliminated, as GWT compiles a specific version optimized for a specific browser. The Data Base Management System (DBMS) used was Oracle MySQL. In order to avoid the complexities of the underlying Data Base Management System (DBMS), and, if needed, to easily swap the DBMS used, an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework was used. Hibernate is an ORM framework that allows the use of natural Object-oriented idioms including inheritance, polymorphism, association, composition, and the Java collections framework to manipulate database data [17]. The hemo@record runs on an Apache Tomcat Web server, an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. In a nutshell, each use-case of the web-application generates a request that is processed by the server that runs in specific business logic, retrieves the requested data from the hemo@record database, transforming the data in Java objects by the use of the ORM framework. These objects transport the data extracted from the database, and are returned to the web-application. The browser that renders the web-application 1254 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1248 â€“ 1255 interprets the data, using the compiled GXT widgets to present it as useful and relevant information for the end user. 4. Conclusions The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in rare and chronic disease have shown numerous advantages in terms of data management and information retrieval, with great impact on the quality of health care provision, research and public health monitoring trends. In the context of hemophilia, several countries had already taken advantage of ICT, implementing technological solutions to support the National Registry of Patients. Portugal is a small country with about 10 million inhabitants and 1000 expected PWH. Despite the fact that the national patient registry is a desire project from several years, the protocol for the creation of an online national registry was only recently signed, involving a group of healthcare professionals, represented by the PACC and a group of researchers from the University of Aveiro. This paper described a web platform that supports the National Patientsâ€™ Registries (NPR) of Haemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies (HoCC) in Portugal. This recently created platform (hemo@record) allows a complete solution for managing the complexity of data associated to Haemophilia and Congenital Coagulopathies patients, including clinical, social and health status monitoring data, thus reflecting in real time the national reality in terms of HoCC data. As such, the hemo@record can give answer in real time to questions such as: 'How many?', 'Where are they?' and 'How are they?â€™ assuring a proper and informed treatment, provided by clinicians of the several HTC from all over the country.

Hemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor that affects the population on a ratio of 1 case for 10,000 people born. Currently, there are several countries with technological platforms to support the National Patients’ Registries (NPR) of Hemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies (HoCC), due to its benefits in the management of the disease. This work presents the technological platform developed in a joint initiative between the University of Aveiro (UA) and the Portuguese Association of Congenital Coagulopathies (PACC), with the purpose of creating the first NPR with HoCC in Portugal. This web application is hosted in the data center of the University of Aveiro, and is being used by the clinicians of the different Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) across the country.

Introduction Sensory Analysis is a scientific area that uses statistical techniques to analyze the results of the evaluation of consumer products by the human senses (sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing) [1]. Sensory Analysis is carried out by tasting panels that evaluate sensorial characteristics of productsâ€™ samples, using different types of scales. In this process, the resulting data is numerous and, as such, its interpretation requires complex statistical analysis. Due to the complexity of the process, it is very important to ensure the consistency of data entry, the correct processing of information, as well as the appropriate visualization format, using modern computer-based information systems. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are a specific class of computer-based information systems that support decision- making activities through the use of analytical models (including knowledge-based systems) and specialized databases [1]. The work presented in this paper is part of a broader project which aim is to create and test a Decision Support System (DSS) prototype to be used in Sensory Analysis. The data that result from the evaluation of products through tasting panels is used in the decisions regarding the products and can also be used to evaluate the tasters that belong to the panel. Pertaining to the models and the data architecture, the proposed DSS comprises two modules: â€˜Tasting Processâ€™ and â€˜Taster Performanceâ€™. The first module refers to the tasting procedure and related data that derives from tasting session. The second one is responsible for grouping all procedures and statistical methods for assessing tastersâ€™ and Tasting Panelsâ€™ performance. The combined information from these two modules will help the responsible make the final decision about the products based on a consistent evaluation process. Technologically, the DSS prototype was planned as a web-application that runs in a secure web server. The user (client) performs requests to the web server and receives information via a web browser. This technological solution implies two benefits: on one hand, the users only need a web browser to use the application, because all the specific computations take place on the server side; and, on the other hand, the application can be accessed from any location, depending only of an internet connection. Data is introduced by the users using user-friendly interfaces, stored on a central database, and visualized in a graphical format. Regarding the DSS development life-cycle, in a first stage, a rigorous requirements engineering process was performed, using direct observation, documental analysis and informal interviews with the domain experts. The relevant data was organized and integrated in a conceptual model [2], represented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation [3]. Since the system has a large component of interactivity, before the technological solution implementation, all interfaces were designed using a LumzyÂ© prototyping tool [4]. In order to create the web application it was necessary to select the ground technology and frameworks that would enable a swift and reliable development of the prototype. Given the current state of open-source technologies it was decided to utilize Free Open-Source Software (FOSS) as the basis for the working prototype. Since the prototype is to be created from scratch, full-stack web frameworks were considered good candidates for the underlying technology. Full-stack web frameworks encompass the full development stack from storing the data to the user interface, thus providing everything needed from the technological viewpoint to complete a functioning web application prototype. This paper presents the process of selecting the most suitable open-source framework for developing the above mentioned Decision Support System (DSS) for Sensory Analysis. Several open-source technologies were analyzed and data was collected in order to determine their viability as a reliable base for the project. 2. Selection Process of an Open-Source Framework for developing a Decision Support System 2.1 About Open-Source Software The Open-Source Software (OSS) is becoming increasingly popular. It can be considered as a multidisciplinary research topic that has received a growing attention during the last decade, attracting the interest of academics and practitioners. OSS represents a software development model, in which the source code is available and the users 1059 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1057 â€“ 1064 (normally programmers) can view, read, modify and redistribute this code without the restrictions of the intellectual property rights [5]. According to Corbly [6], a software product can be considered open-source if it meets several criteria, namely: (i) the software must be available without costs; (ii) the program must be distributed as source code or compiled code; (iii) programmers and/or end-users may alter the programâ€™s code; and (iv) the modified source code must be redistributed under the same conditions as the license for the original version of the software. Today, OSS solutions can be found in many typical business applications. However, ready-made OSS solutions rarely fully meet the end-usersâ€™ needs, requiring, most of them, some level of adaptation. The collective intelligence is the basic definition underlying the OSS solutions, representing the intelligence that emerges when a group of individuals do things together [5]. OSS projects are based on virtual support communities that use the software and, consequently participate in their development. The community members learn from each other and, as a result, the overall abilities and skills of the community are improved. In this study several open-source frameworks are analyzed and data are collected to determine their viability as a reliable base for a project. Given the role of collective intelligence and the power of crowds in the OSS context, the methodology used in this project was based on content analysis in Online Collaborative Spaces. 2.2 The process of selecting an Open-Source Framework A framework is a cohesive design and implementation artefact and represents a set of classes, interfaces and patterns to solve a group of problems, which is a popular method to improve the development efficiency and reduce the development cost [7]. It defines an abstract design, providing common behaviour, and allowing the user to insert its specific behaviour by sub-classing or plug-in in specific implementations. There are several free open-source full- stack web frameworks to aid in the development of web applications [8], [9], [10]. In this study, a group of popular frameworks was selected to be further analyzed. All these frameworks had to meet a few criteria: (i) be completely FOSS, (ii) encompass the full development stack, (iii) work with a popular language, (iv) have a robust Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for extensive and easy data querying and manipulation, (v) focus on productivity, and (vi) have real use cases. Additionally, given that the DSS needs to manipulate a significant volume of data to calculate the relevant statistics, the underlying ORM, Data Base Management System (DBMS) and coding language should perform adequately. These criteria lead to the election of four web frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Django, Grails and Play. Ruby on Rails was considered for being an early popular and highly productive full-stack web framework that heavily influenced other frameworks. Django was chosen for being a widely used web framework for Python. Grails and Play frameworks were chosen for their high productivity and performance and for working with Java, notably the most used programming language with strong presence in the industry. All the selected frameworks provide rapid prototyping and adhere to a common modern set of philosophies and architectural patterns like the â€˜model-view-controllerâ€™ (MVC) pattern, â€˜convention over configurationâ€™ (CoC) and â€˜don't repeat yourselfâ€™ (DRY). This comes in part from the influence that Ruby on Rails popularity had on the development of the remaining selected frameworks. This study was performed based on the analysis of the above mentioned four, well-known, web frameworks, briefly characterized in Table 1. Table 1. Analyzed frameworks and main characteristics Framework (Tested version) First release Language Company Current License Django (1.6.5) July, 2005 Python Django Software Foundation BSD License Grails (2.4.2) March, 2006 Groovy and Java Pivotal Apache License Play (2.2.2) May, 2008 Scala and Java Zengularity and Typesafe Apache License Ruby On Rails (4.1.4) July, 2004 Ruby Rails Core Team MIT License Some of the development philosophies and paradigms of each framework are briefly stated by their founders: 1060 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1057 â€“ 1064 (i) Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design [11]. (ii) Grails is inspired by Ruby on Rails and â€œGrails is an Open-Source, full stack, web application framework for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It takes advantage of the Groovy programming language and convention over configuration to provide a productive and stream-lined development experience.â€� [12]. (iii) Play is inspired by Ruby on Rails and Django and â€œPlay is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture. Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications.â€� [13]. (iv) â€œRuby on RailsÂ® is an open-source web framework thatâ€™s optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favouring convention over configuration.â€� [14]. Selecting an open-source framework as the foundation for a project should take into account some mandatory aspects like: activity, reliability, and performance. Whereas for classical commercial software the reliability, performance and support are assured in a customer-seller relationship, in free open-source software these are often only assured by the community, with no warranties [15]. As such, it becomes increasingly necessary to study and understand the selected software to ensure it can perform as necessary and respond in a reliable manner to the project requirements. Understanding what makes a free open-source project viable for production usage is thus essential. There are some characteristics considered crucial to ensure the reliability of a free open-source software, namely: (i) Strong and active community: a project with an active and invested community is alive and it will probably have rapid iterations in its development and debugging; (ii) Good documentation and tutorials: quality learning materials and detailed documentation lowers the entry barrier and reduces the learning curve for new developers, meaning they will be productive much sooner; (iii) Proven real use cases: when a large company creates a product or service making use of an open-source project it usually results in the company also investing in the framework itself. Furthermore, large companies often have the most demanding scenarios regarding reliability, performance, scalability and productivity being a good measure of how reliable a framework is. â€œThereâ€™s rarely a reason to choose a framework without a great community, great documentation, and a mature set of companies using it to run successful production applicationsâ€� [16]. In order to select an appropriate framework for the project in analysis (a DSS for sensory analysis), the following characteristics were analysed: (i) popularity and use cases, (ii) activity and trends, and (iii) job offers. All data were collected on June of 2014. Open-source software needs a strong community to stay active, so popularity becomes an important factor when analyzing open-source frameworks. In addition, an open-source project must be proven to be useful, so production use cases are also important as they demonstrate the reliability of the framework in a real use case. To gauge the popularity of the considered frameworks the number of users in the project mailing list and the number of followers in Twitter and StackOverflow.com are shown in Table 2. This table also presents the most notable uses of the frameworks under analysis. Table 2. Framework popularity and use cases, Jun 2014 Framework Mailing list users Twitter followers StackOverflow followers Notable uses Django 26.6k 21.0k 10.7k Pinterest, Instagram, Mozilla, The Washington Times, Disqus, Public BroadCasting Service Grails - 11.2k 2.2k Atlassian, sky, LinkedIn Recruiter, eHarmony, ESPN, Netflix Play 11.3k 14.7k 1.6k Linkedin, Coursera, theguardian, Klout, Gilt, ZapTravel Ruby On Rails 26k 77.9k 15.7k GitHub, Yammer, Scribd, Shopify, Hulu, Basecamp 1061 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1057 â€“ 1064 StackOverflow is a Q&A site for programmers that is widely used, with more than 170 million visits per month [17]. It should be noted that StackOverflow doesn't necessarily represent all the frameworks equally. Some programming languages and frameworks may rely more in other discussion tools like community forums or equivalent. But given its high number of visitors it should give a reasonable general assessment of each framework users. For example, Django and Ruby on Rails are the older frameworks and clearly show a larger user base. All frameworks show interesting real use case scenarios with examples of large companies using each of the elected open-source projects. Community activity indicates how intensively a project is used. Strong user activity will usually lead to stronger development. A possible way to measure user activity is, for example, to look at the number of monthly questions in StackOverflow. Search trends indicate developersâ€™ interest and relevance of the open-source projects. Interest tendencies give some insight into how developers focus and preferences are evolving. Regarding these two characteristics, Figure 1 (left side) illustrates the StackOverflow tagged monthly questions and Figure 1 (right side) shows the Google search trends (search statistics were collected from Google pertaining to the period from January of 2004 to June of 2014). As the charts in Figure 1 show, Django and Ruby on Rails have the highest activity although Grails and Play are slowly growing. Older frameworks will tend to have larger user bases even if there are new better ones. Developers have a tendency to adopt a framework they like and keep with it for some time. Projects that have been completed need maintenance or further development, meaning the framework chosen at start will continue to be utilized. Regarding search trends, Ruby on Rails had a huge demand when it first launched, probably because it was one of the first open-source full-stack web-framework to be released. It became widely adopted when it was bundled with Appleâ€™s OS X 10.5 in August 2006. As other frameworks were released and improved (2009 onwards) Ruby on Rails searches started to diminish because developersâ€™ interest shifted. Fig.1. StackOverflow tagged monthly questions (left) and Google search trends Jan 2004 â€“ Jun 2014 (right) The number of job offers that refer a given framework show the adoption level of the frameworks by the industry and indicate the volume of real use case scenarios. Job offers for the frameworks were recorded from three different sites: Dice.com, Indeed.com and Linkedin.com and are shown in Figure 2. Play framework is not presented due to difficulties in search terms. 1062 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1057 â€“ 1064 Fig. 2. Job offers in the US on December 2014 Ruby on Rails has the largest demand but all frameworks have similar strong magnitudes of job offers, indicating a relevant interest and adoption by the software industry. On the top of this analysis and, in order to choose the appropriate framework for the system in analysis, the initial tutorials were followed and a basic project was built to better understand the workflow and productivity of each framework. It was found that all the frameworks offer similar functionalities and organization, which probably results from sharing the same development philosophies and patterns (Grails and Play were heavily influenced by Ruby on Rails). Django is a good framework, competent in all aspects. Grails is very easy to use with very good documentation and it has a bundled IDE (Groovy/Grails Tool Suite) which really simplifies its utilization. The Groovy language used in Grails is a syntax light language, easy to learn, and highly productive, and the ability to use Java interchangeably with Groovy allows a developer with Java knowledge to be productive, while learning Groovy, which is ideal for shorter projects. Play framework is a highly performing and light-weight framework, the tutorials for Java however were not very detailed as Java, when compared to the Scala language. Ruby on Rails seems quite robust but not as user friendly as the other frameworks. 2.3 Results Each of the studied frameworks revealed a strong and active community with frequent development iterations. A strong community is one of the most important assets for an Open-Source Project. It generates a wealth of information in the form of questions and answers in sites like StackOverflow or in forums for developers. This exchange of information and discussion of ideas can greatly help a framework to move forward and become more robust, polished and easier to use. A large community can also create a large ecosystem around a framework which in turn can generate more plugins, tools and tutorials that can enhance the utilization of the framework. There is demand in the industry for developers with experience in all of these frameworks, which means that it is positive for any developer to invest time in learning them and gain experience by use them. Challenging real use case projects exist for each of the studied frameworks (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram) which indicate good reliability and performance. Through the data analyzed in this work the four frameworks were shown to be viable candidates with healthy communities, industry demand and proven real use cases. In terms of popularity Ruby on Rails largely exceeds the others frameworks, due to its age. Recently Ruby on Rails search trends has been declining, as Grails and Django are increasing. A possible explanation for this, can be that developers are transitioning from Ruby on Rails to newer frameworks that offer similar high productive environments inspired by the same philosophies prevalent in Ruby on Rails. Grails has a strong demand even when compared to Ruby on Rails and taking into account the difference in their popularity, indicating the possibility of Grails demand in the industry being growing since it is being adopted by more developers. Although Ruby on Rails is still the most popular of the frameworks its advantage has been diminishing in favour of newer frameworks. Grails growing search trends and strong demand in the industry together with its high productivity, ease of use and great documentation make it the ideal choice for this project. ruby on rails grails django 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 LinkedIn.com Indeed.com Dice.com 1063 Leonor Teixeira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 1057 â€“ 1064 3. Conclusions In any project, the selection process of a web framework is somehow subjective depending, largely, on the complexity of the project as well as on the needs and the preferences of the developer. As such, some of the factors to consider, when selecting a web framework, include the programming experience of the developer, the available supporting libraries, the size or scale of the project, and the functionalities required by the project [18]. The present work described the process of evaluating some of the most popular open-source frameworks in order to find the most suitable one for developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for Sensory Analysis. The popular frameworks Django, Grails, Play, and Ruby on Rails were studied regarding characteristics like activity, reliability, and performance. All frameworks reveal strong and healthy communities, good documentation and tutorials, and proven real use cases. In this particular case Grails was the chosen framework. The strong demand and search trends that were observed indicated Grails as a solid choice to many developers. Although Ruby on Rails has still higher popularity, search trends indicate a retreating curve and the demand gap between them is closing. Additionally, the tutorials done in each framework showed Grails to be more productive and easy to use, which results, in part, from the well structured documentation and information created by its active community. These aspects contributed to an informed choice and led to the election of Grails as the appropriate web framework for the project-at-hand.

The use of frameworks based on Free Open-Source Software (FOSS) has become a viable alternative in the software development process, when compared with Proprietary Software or Closed Source Software. Given that the quality of Open-Source Software (OSS) products varies widely, the careful evaluation of such frameworks, according to a set of requirements, is an important step in the software development process. This work presents the evaluation of some open-source frameworks in order to find the most suitable one for developing a Decision Support System (DSS) to use in Sensory Analysis. This DSS is being designed to support the evaluation of Tasting Panels in sectors where Sensory Analysis is used to assess products’ quality. The methodology used, based on content analysis in Online Collaborative Spaces, proved to be appropriate to achieve the objectives of this study and therefore, can be extended to select OSS in other areas. Thus, the result of this work is valuable not only for researchers on trends in the OSS area, but also for software developers that intend to implement DSS using FOSS.

In this context, family health histories play an increasingly important role in healthcare, aiding practitioners in the diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment of various conditions. The clinical pedigree, a graphic representation combining family structure and clinical information, is a well-accepted tool to represent family health histories. At present this tool remains underused, possibly due to the lack of pedigree management tools in health information systems. OntoFam addresses this problem by offering a clinical pedigree information system that can be integrated with current health information systems. This paper presents the method used to create OntoFam’s interactive pedigree visualization by wrapping an existing open source pedigree drawing engine. The resulting environment allows practitioners to interactively view, create and manipulate pedigrees. This paper also describes the evaluation strategy that was developed to assess the system and includes its preliminary results.",

The opinion of employees is, nowadays, an important factor to consider because their perception may be related to their behavior. The satisfaction of all individuals housed in a thermal environment is an “almost” impossible task because a thermally comfortable environment for one person may be uncomfortable for another. Therefore, it would be ideal to create a thermal environment that satisfied the largest number of workers. As such, the evaluation of thermal comfort implies a certain degree of subjectivity and requires the analysis of two aspects: physical (thermal environment) and subjective (state of mind of the individual). This study aims to analyze the pattern of thermal sensation of a packaging section of quick-frozen desalted codfish, discover the location of the most vulnerable workstations to thermal stress and assess the real thermal sensation of workers. The data were collected using a measurement instrument named “Center 317—temperature humidity meter”. For the analysis of thermal sensation the follow indexes were applied: Temperature Humidity Index (THI), Thermal Comfort Scale (EsConTer) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). A set of standards were created for each variable and the results obtained indicate the most vulnerable workstations. Intervention strategies were considered.",

Thermal comfort is an extremely broad concept directly related to ergonomics, energy buildings consumption and workers' performance. The present paper intends to analyse the thermal environment inside of a Portuguese manufacturing metalworking industry in order to understand its influence in worker's performance and well-being. For this purpose, two types of studies were conducted: analytical and empirical. The analytical exploration regards the indoor thermal environment study concerning two thermal indexes: EsConTer and THI. The empirical exploration consists in workers' thermal sensation study, regarding a thermal colour scale based in ASHRAE seven-point thermal scale. Therefore a measuring instrument was used, 'Testo 435-4', to collect air temperature (°C), air relative humidity (%) and wet bulb temperature (°C) data. The EsConTer index was the most surprising applied method since it showed itself capable to describe the thermal environment of an industrial space due to its correlation with THI, and at the same time adequate to define workers' thermal sensation. Moreover, the authors consider thermal environment studies in workplaces an important aspect to improve the productivity of workers in business contexts.",

All rights reserved.This chapter outlines a study that examines the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in management of a rare and chronic disease, hemophilia. Evidence in literature shows how the adoption of ICTs can improve the management of chronic conditions. Furthermore, these tools may also give response to rare diseases' needs, while greatly improving the quality of life of those patients. A Web-based application that was developed to facilitate communication between Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and patients in a specific Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC), to improve the utility and quality of clinical data and treatment information, as well as to help the management of resources involved in a specific rare chronic disease, represents a practical case presented in this chapter. This technological solution allows the management of inherited bleeding disorders, integrating, diffusing, and archiving large sets of data relating to the clinical practice of hemophilia care, more specifically the clinical practice at the Hematology Service of Coimbra Hospital Center.",

The need to reduce (direct or indirect) costs through the processes' improvement, not only productively but also administratively, is gaining even more weight for organizations. Thus, there are many companies which are starting to reflect on their processes and on a way of becoming more competitive and more efficient. Through the improvement of the management information mechanisms, it is possible to make processes more efficient so that they can release resources for other activities. This is the context in which this project emerges, which aims to improve a Logistics process (customer service), using a simple, objective and functional solution with an immediate response to the elimination of waste in a decision making process. Behind this implementation, there is a whole study based on Lean methodologies that help to understand the project, to identify the improvements and to structure its conception.",

However, the concept of DMS is far from being consensual. The present study aims to clarify the concept of DMS by identifying the main differences between DMS and other DMO web-applications/websites regarding functionalities targeted at potential visitors of destinations. This study is carried out based on a comparison between DMS-specific and DMS-non-specific sources (papers and book chapters). The results suggest that the major difference between DMS and more traditional DMO websites relies in the transaction dimension. While DMS-non-specific reviewed sources tend to focus more on informational functionalities, DMS-specific studies clearly highlight transaction tools. The study highlights the need to develop DMS including a more varied range of transactional and communication/relationship functionalities.",

In particular, the study described in this article has as its objective to assess the motivation forthe use of the wikis by a group of students from the technological area of higher education, and to carry out a comparison between students that intend to continue making use of this tool in future activities and those that do not plan to use this technology. This experience was made in the context of a classroom, and the data were obtained through the application of two questionnaires and analysis of the history of the wiki created for the activity developed in the classroom. The results showed that the students, despite knowing the tool, did not know in practice about its editing mode. The features of the wikis better classified by the students are related to the perceived ease of use and with the usefulness of the tool, in so far as it promotes learning through contents placed in it by others and through the conduction of group work relying neither on the physical presence of the members nor on their schedules. It has also been observed that the motivation for the use of the wikis turned out to be, in some items, significantly different among the groups compared.",

Currently SDO estimates the software effort based on the opinion of one area expert. The disadvantages of this method and the willingness to incorporate the best practices of CMMI encouraged the SDO to replace the existing effort estimation method by a formal one. The stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) technique was selected and used for the software development and software testing processes. The results achieved with MLR were compared with the estimates provided by the area expert. The model obtained for the testing team performed better results than the expert judgments, while for the development team no satisfactory model was found and a proposal for collecting data from new variables is presented.",

Also, the widespread deployment of Passive Optical Networks (PON) requires extra power budgets, which are normally achieved by increased laser optical power or amplification. In these conditions the nonlinear effects become an extra impairment factor, which has to be brought to attention. Furthermore, while compensating their impacts into propagation by means of back-propagation the precise definition of their impact and magnitude is required. In this work we will observe the potential and validity of the Volterra series when applied to both high powers, high channel densities and high-order constellation conditions. © 2012 SPIE.",

Furthermore, these tools may also give response to rare diseases' needs, while greatly improving the quality of life of those patients. A Web-based application that was developed to facilitate communication between Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and patients in a specific Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC), to improve the utility and quality of clinical data and treatment information, as well as to help the management of resources involved in a specific rare chronic disease, represents a practical case presented in this chapter. This technological solution allows the management of inherited bleeding disorders, integrating, diffusing, and archiving large sets of data relating to the clinical practice of hemophilia care, more specifically the clinical practice at the Hematology Service of Coimbra Hospital Center.",

According to the study results, 73% of 308 Portuguese local governments have already incorporated one of the Web 2.0 technologies, being social networking the most widespread one, used by approximately half of them. Evaluation of citizens' adherence to official Facebook, YouTube and Twitter pages of local governments have shown that Portuguese citizens from middle and large sized cities seem to be more likely to adhere to the official pages of local authorities than the European citizens from the countries analysed in another study.

After the data collection, using a pen data acquisition (Easy Log USB), the thermal index 'Temperature Humidity Index (THI)' and the diagram of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) were used. The results showed a consistency in the methods applied and suggest its applicability in the industrial context for the adoption of preventive and organizational measures, and/or for the replacement of equipment. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",

As such, an effective management of this disease, with maximum safety for patients, involves not only an efficient information management process, but also the coordination and management of all the associated resources.

The sample included 67 users of SAP R/3 that were present throughout the process. Considering the results, the authors conclude that the implementation of SAP R/3 in MPO was successful, and the respondents consider their work more productive and achieve easier access to information. The existence of a solid team to support the project was established as a major facilitator in the whole process, as opposed to the limited time and lack of training that emerged as barriers to the implementation. It was also found that the learning period assumes a high importance in the success of the implementation, since increasing the training time reduces the need for support to the end-users. © 2012, IGI Global.",

This kind of disease follows the patient through his/her life, and its treatment requires an almost permanent exchange of data/information with healthcare professional (HCPs), with the information and communications technologies (ICTs) a key contribution in this process. However, most applications based on those ICTs do not allow the analysis of heterogeneous data in real-time, requiring the availability of clinicians to check the data and analyze the information to support the clinical decision process. Since time is a scarce resource in the context of healthcare providers, and information a crucial resource in the decision support process, real-time monitoring systems can help finding the right balance between those two resources, presenting the key information in an appropriate format, through alerts and KPIs.

However, there are also hazards associated with the introduction of ICTs in this domain and a great number of projects have failed due to the lack of systematic consideration of human and other non-technology issues throughout the design or implementation process, particularly in the requirements engineering process. This paper presents the methodological approach followed in the design process of a web-based information system (WbIS) for managing the clinical information in hemophilia care, which integrates the values and practices of user-centered design (UCD) activities into the principles of software engineering, particularly in the phase of requirements engineering (RE). This process followed a paradigm that combines a grounded theory for data collection with an evolutionary design based on constant development and refinement of the generic domain model using three well-known methodological approaches: (a) object-oriented system analysis; (b) task analysis; and, (c) prototyping, in a triangulation work. This approach seems to be a good solution for the requirements engineering process in this particular case of the health care domain, since the inherent weaknesses of individual methods are reduced, and emergent requirements are easier to elicit.

However, there are also hazards associated with the introduction of ICTs in this domain and a great number of projects have failed due to the lack of systematic consideration of human and other non-technology issues throughout the design or implementation process, particularly in the requirements engineering process. This paper presents the methodological approach followed in the design process of a web-based information system (WbIS) for managing the clinical information in hemophilia care, which integrates the values and practices of user-centered design (UCD) activities into the principles of software engineering, particularly in the phase of requirements engineering (RE). This process followed a paradigm that combines a grounded theory for data collection with an evolutionary design based on constant development and refinement of the generic domain model using three well-known methodological approaches: (a) object-oriented system analysis; (b) task analysis; and, (c) prototyping, in a triangulation work. This approach seems to be a good solution for the requirements engineering process in this particular case of the health care domain, since the inherent weaknesses of individual methods are reduced, and emergent requirements are easier to elicit. Moreover, the requirements triangulation matrix gives the opportunity to look across the results of all used methods and decide what requirements are critical for the system success. Keywords Health information systems Requirements engineering User-centered design Human-factor engineering system Triangulation matrix Hemophilia 1 Introduction The use of sophisticated information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the health care domain is a way to improve the quality of services. The literature points to a general consensus that health information systems (HISs) are thought to have the potential to improve patient care. However, there are also hazards associated with the introduction of ICTs in health care, and some works report how difficult it is the successful introduction of ICTs in this domain [1,2]. In fact, health care is a unique and complex domain and HISs have human safety implications and profound effects on individual patient care [3]. Successful development of HISs can increase efficiency and productivity, ease of use and learning, adoption, retention and satisfaction of the users [2], and simultaneously, can help to decrease medical errors as well as to reduce support and training cost [4]. On the other hand, HISs are usually complex systems and their failures may cause negative effects on patients [5–7] and possibly, when insufficiently designed, they may result in spending more time with the computer than with the patient [8]. According to [9] ICTs have been hailed as a solution to reduce errors in health care, but there is also evidence that they can be part of the problem. There are a large number of HISs projects that have failed, and most of these failures are not due to flawed technology, but rather due to the lack of systematic consideration of human and other non-technology issues throughout the design or implementation process [10–12]. Also, several studies have shown that 80% of total maintenance costs with information systems (ISs) are related to users’ problems and not technical bugs, and among them 64% are related with usability problems [13]. A survey of over 8000 projects made by The Standish Group and undertaken by 350 US different companies revealed that one third of the projects were never completed and one half succeeded with partial functionalities. The major source of such failures resided on poor requirements, specifically: the lack of user involvement (13%), incomplete requirements (12%), changing requirements (11%), unrealistic expectations (6%), and unclear objectives (5%) [14]. These problems are mainly due to the fact that, in developing interactive software, most software engineering methodologies do not propose any mechanisms to: (i) explicitly and empirically identify and specify user needs and usability requirements; and (ii) test and validate requirements with end-users before and during the development process [15]. The health care domain has been particularly prone to such problems in recent years, and there are numerous examples of potentially useful systems that have failed or have been abandoned due to unanticipated human or organizational issues [16–18]. Since the design of systems that are used by people is a complex endeavor, the systems that cannot be used intuitively often lead to an increase in error rate and a decrease in user acceptance [19]. Involving end-users in the design process has been suggested to be a key marginal investment for being able to transform the cost related to the implementation of HISs into future benefits [20–22]. Moreover, the participation of end-users and the involvement of relevant stakeholders in early steps of the design process, not only prevents post-implementation problems, but also gives them the chance to address and resolve potential conflicts concerning the future system [23]. However, involving end-users in development of HISs is often complicated, especially when they have limited computer skills or due to the fact that users’ knowledge is tacit and consequently task description is very difficult. Particularly in healthcare, effective research of user requirements is often discussed in terms of which method to use or “which method is better”, since the dominant culture in this industry is still train people to adapt to poorly designed technology, rather than designing technology to fit to people's characteristics [11]. The principles of user-centered design (UCD) [4,24] combined with ethnographic practices [25] can improve synergies among technology, people and work environment (tasks). In order to perform a user needs analysis and to write requirements specification for integrated care in the hemophilia field, we followed a user-centered requirement engineering process involving the end-users through different techniques of requirements elicitation and validation. This work describes the application of UCD principles in the requirements engineering process to generate the requirements document of a web-based information system (WbIS) for managing the clinical information in hemophilia care, as well as some results. The research was based on three well-known methodological approaches: the first one consisted of a classical object-oriented systems analysis (OOSA) method based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation; the second consisted in a task analysis (TA) method based on hierarchical task analysis (HTA) notation; and the third consisted in prototyping based on the construction of an executable system model. These three methods were performed through an iterative development process combined with grounded theory (GT) in a triangulation work. 2 Background 2.1 Requirements engineering process The success of any software system depends on how well it fits the needs of its users and its environment [26]. Software requirements comprise these needs, and requirements engineering (RE) is the process by which the requirements are determined [27]. A requirement is a property that a system must exhibit in order to meet the system's motivation need; and software requirements are a property which must be exhibited by software developed to solve a particular problem within one organizational context. Therefore the software requirements are a complex combination of requirements from different people at different levels of an organization and from the environment in which the system must execute [28]. They express the needs and constraints placed on a software product that contribute to the solution of some real-world problem and normally result of an arrangement between “user requirements” and “system requirements”, Fig. 1 . User requirements denote the requisites of the people who will be the system client or end-users. System requirements add requirements of other stakeholders (such as regulatory authorities) and requirements that do not have an identifiable human source and that normally result from the intersection among technical, cultural and social environments [28,29]. The information system (IS) is never used on its own but always as part of some broader system including hardware, people and, often, organizations [30]. Successful RE involves understanding the needs of users, clients and other stakeholders, as well as understanding the context in which the software will be used [27]. Thus, identifying all the users and other stakeholders who may be impacted by the system is very important and this will help to ensure that the needs of all those involved are taken into account and, if required, the system is tested by them. In the literature, RE is presented as a knowledge area of software engineering related with elicitation, analysis, specification and validation of software requirements [29]. However, and according to [30], this process of RE is difficult for several reasons: (i) stakeholders often do not know what they want from the system, except in general terms; (ii) stakeholders express requirements in their own terms and with implicit knowledge of their work, and requirements engineers, without experience in the user domain, must understand these requirements; (iii) different stakeholders have different requirements, which they may express in different ways; (iv) political factors may influence the system requirements; (v) the business environment in which the analysis takes place is dynamic. The resulting requirements document has to be understood and usable by domain experts and other stakeholders, who may not be knowledgeable about computing [27]. Hence, requirements notation used in models that involve users’ validation must use a balanced language adequate for stakeholders having computing and non-computing backgrounds. On the other hand, it should be noted that the analyses of activities to elicit the user requirements, which normally focus on present activities, can change in time. When the new artifact was implemented, the activity also changed, thus, the analysis of the user needs might be outdated. This ‘vicious circle’ was presented by Carroll et al. [31] as the task–artifact cycle. In other words, the task–artifact cycle is an iterative process of continuous, mutually dependent development between task and artifact, a process that will never reach an optimum state. This cycle suggests a revision of the original task for which the artifact was made, and consequently the redesign of the artifact according to the new identified requirements. To avoid this trap, and to aid the communication among different stakeholders with different background, some authors proposed several techniques and methods. For example, the so-called “Concept of Operations (ConOps)” was proposed by Fairley and Thayer [32], as a way of dealing with that problematic issue. In our case, we used evolutionary design techniques combined with UCD principles to minimize the impact that may arise from the basic assumption of the task–artifact cycle. 2.2 User-centered design approach Within the field of software development, there are several approaches for designing software applications. User-centered design (UCD) is one of them concerned with incorporating the perspective of the users into the software development process in order to achieve a desirable and usable system [10,33,34]. UCD is a complement to software engineering traditional methods rather than a substitute. Maguire [4] and Ji-Ye et al. [24] describe UCD as a multidisciplinary design approach based on the active involvement of users to improve the understanding of user and task requirements, and the iteration of design and evaluation. Much has been written in the research literature about UCD and as further evidence of internationally endorsed best practice, this approach is defined in ISO documents, including ISO 13407 [35]. It states that there are four design activities that need to start at the earliest stages of a project: (i) understand and specify the context of use; (ii) specify the user and organizational requirements; (iii) produce design solutions; and, (iv) evaluate design against requirements. In the healthcare domain the application of the UCD principles is more recent, namely some UCD approaches, such as the human centered distributed information design methodology (HCDID) by Zhang et al. [34] and Rinkus et al. [10] and the user-centered framework proposed by Johnson et al. [33], which are based on four types of analyses: (i) user analysis – identifying the characteristics of existing and potential users; (ii) functional analysis – identifying a system's abstract structures of a given domain model; (iii) representational analysis – identifying an appropriate information display format for a given task performed by a specific type of users; and (iv) task analysis – identifying the procedures and actions to be carried out as well as the information to be processed to achieve task goals by using specific representations. Beuscart-Zéphir et al. [36] present another UCD approach, an user-centered assessment method, that includes three main dimensions of analysis: qualitative management, usability assessment, and performance analysis. Beuscart-Zéphir et al. [21], Carroll et al. [22] and Kushniruk [37] also advocate the importance of user involvement during early phases of the design process in the development of HISs, based on formative evaluation. Health information systems (HISs) are highly complex systems and, we believe that a proper UCD approach has the potential to improve the quality of the final solution. The lack of minimum considerations of design principles centered in human factors in many HISs makes them very difficult to learn and use, and this difficulty leads to strong resistance by users, in some cases it leads to abandoning the HIS altogether or increasing “human error” resulting from an incorrect usage [34]. The paradigm of UCD in health care domain [10–12,33,34,36,38,39] offers a new look at system design including human factors, covering more than usability engineering, and human factors. Basically, the goal of a UCD approach consists in creating systems that are modeled in conformity with the characteristics and tasks of the potential users. UCD has given rise to many forms of design practices in which various characteristics of the context of use are considered. Particularly, in the medical informatics domain, several authors emphasize the need for UCD development and argue for an early user involvement [9,12,40]. This development process paradigm can be improved using ethnographic practices. Myers [25], Sommerville [30] and Gennari et al. [41] present ethnographic method as observational techniques that can be used to understand social and organizational requirements having a strong contribution to a complex set of communication behaviors and needs. In this context, the main value of this technique is that it helps requirements engineers to discover implicit requirements that reflect the actual rather than the formal process in which people are involved. Sometimes users may have difficulties expressing their tasks, therefore we need to apply ethnographic methods to observe and analyze them in order to be able to get some evidence to help deducting the requirements. 3 A web-based information system for managing clinical information in hemophilia care In this section, we will present a study where we applied the user-centered requirements engineering methodology. Firstly, we will describe the domain problem and the critical aspects that justify the application of an UCD approach. Then we will explain the study design, namely the methods and procedures of applying the principles of UCD in RE process. After that, we present the results of the methodology process. Finally, we discuss and explain the impact of the method on the requirement engineering process in this particular problem and in health care IS, in general. 3.1 Study contextualization This study was requested by the hematology service of a regional hospital (HS_CHC) in order to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of a WbIS to assist the hemophilia patient care at this hemophilia treatment center (HTC) located in the center region of Portugal. This HTC provides assistance to about 200 patients (≈30% of the registered patients in Portugal) in three integrated hospitals and provides clinical and laboratorial support to other hospitals all over the country. The main goal of this application is to support the management of inherited bleeding disorders, which involves the integration, distribution and archive of large sets of information coming from heterogeneous sources in the scope of hemophilia care, as well as to facilitate communication between health care professionals (HCPs) and patients at this HTC. Currently, in order to support the information flow and communication between different HCPs, this HTC uses several different computer-based and paper-based ISs. The computer-based ISs are basically: (i) IHIS (Integrated Hospital Information System) – which allows to visualize, manage and archive the administrative information while opening a clinical process; (ii) MIS (Medical Support Information System) – which allows to visualize, manage and archive clinical information during the medical appointments; (iii) NIS (Nursing Support Information System) – which allows to visualize, manage and archive nursing information; (iv) and, ClinidataXXI – to archive clinical analysis results and laboratorial information providing on-line service at the three afore mentioned hospitals. These computer-based ISs represent generic solutions, since they were developed to support generic requirements of Hospitals and Healthcare Centers, and consequently cannot respond to the specific needs of hemophilia care. In fact, HCPs of hemophilia care generate a lot of information when they see their patients; part of this information is in electronic format and is stored in computer-based ISs; but another part (i.e. home treatment records, joint exam records, life quality records) is on paper format and is stored in paper files. At present, patients record the result of home infusion treatment in paper diaries and send them to the HTC by post, fax, or bring them when they attend routine review appointments. This system has a number of weaknesses as often paper records are incomplete or not returned. Moreover, the period between individual infusions of treatments and receipt data may be long, which is undesirable, since that data is very important for clinical decision about treatments. In this pathology, the information is more than a resource, as further clinical decisions about patients’ treatment depend on it. The fact that the information concerning hemophilia patients is spread throughout different ISs is an obstacle for quality of data, fast retrieval of information and, consequently, healthcare quality. The need of an integrated IS for this specific pathology is obvious, and new ICTs have an important role in this field. Portugal, in spite of having about 700 patients with hemophilia, does not have a hemophilia national patient registry and most HTCs do not have a specific system to store and manage information concerning this pathology. This problem emerges in the scope of a highly complex environment, characterized by missing information, shifting goals and a great deal of uncertainty [37]. Healthcare decisions are complex processes strongly based on tacit knowledge that contributes for a difficult process of requirement elicitation using traditional methodologies. Therefore we believe that the combination of a traditional system development methodology with UCD actively involving users in the design process can improve the elicitation requirements process in this domain, taking into account the natural impact that may arise from the basic assumption of the task–artifact cycle, proposed by Carroll et al. [31]. 3.2 Methods and study design To conduct this study along the requirement engineering process, we followed an approach that combines a grounded theory (GT) with an evolutionary design based on constant development and refinement of the generic domain model. All users, i.e., physicians, nurses, laboratorial staff, administrative staff and patients were, directly or indirectly, involved in all steps of this study. To avoid a technical focus, which too often has been the case of similar projects, different analysis and validation methods using the UCD principles were chosen to accomplish the RE process: (i) the first one consisted of a classical OOSA method represented by UML notation; (ii) the second consisted in a model-based TA represented by HTA notation; (iii) the third consisted in the prototyping technique based on developing an executable system model. The research based on three well-known methodological approaches was developed through an iterative process under two conditions: (i) the users were active and showed about the same level of participation in all phases of the design; and, (ii) the context of use was taken into account in all phases of the design, Fig. 2 (on the left side). According to the representation in Fig. 2, the different methods of our methodology (on the left side of the Fig. 2) have a match with the levels of analysis of the human-centered approach (HCC) proposed by Zhang et al. [11,34] and Rinkus et al. [10] and used by Johnson et al. in their user-centered framework [33] (on the right side of the Fig. 2). Basically with the first method (OOSA) we are trying to capture the same information as the user and functional analysis level; our second method (TA) has the same principle of the task analysis level; and, the prototyping methods have a correspondence with the representation analysis level in the HCC methodology. Nevertheless, our methodology differs from the HCC methodology as we applied the different methods using an iterative design approach based on triangulation work, in order to validate and improve the domain model. The main objective of our methodology is to support the initial part of the process (i.e. the elicitation and transformation of users’ needs into detailed requirements specifications) in the development of a new IS. Triangulation is an approach to data collection and analysis that uses multiple methods, measures, or approaches to look for convergence on product requirements or other problem areas [42,43]. In general it refers to the application of different sources of data, methods and theories to investigate the same phenomenon [8,44]. This approach has two main objectives: (i) validation of results in order to confirm results with data from other sources or methods; and (ii) completeness of results in order to complement the data with new results, thus to find new information to get additional pieces to the overall system [8]. Therefore, these objectives were the two main reasons by which we chose and applied a triangulation approach in the present study. According to the types of triangulation mentioned by [8,44], we used (i) ‘data triangulation’ during data collection activities, where various data sources were used; and, (ii) ‘methods triangulation’ during the evolutionary design activities, where several methods for analysis and validation were applied; according to [43], a ‘between-methods triangulation’ in a ‘sequential combination of methods’. Basically, the ‘between-methods triangulation’ refers to the process of combining different methods in order to test external validity and ‘sequential combination of methods’ refers to the sequential application of the methods [43]. 3.2.1 Grounded theory: the research methods for data collection The study outlined in this article was developed along two years. During the first nine months, an exploratory study was made based on a grounded theory (GT) approach. The GT approach was published in 1967 by Glaser and Strauss as a qualitative method in social research [45] and it supports the inductive development of theories which are grounded in data to explain a phenomenon [46,47]. The theory emerges of the process from systematically recording and analyzing data related to the phenomenon, normally called ‘constant comparison’. In the present context, we used a GT approach to explain the clinical practice in the HS_CHC and consequently to support the process of RE in a complex environment on the basis of a comprehensive domain model. The use of GT to aid the requirements engineering activities is not very common, however is not novel too. For instance, the works of Galal and Paul [48], Garde and Knaup [3] and Kuziemsky et al. [49] describe the application of this qualitative approach in the RE process, and the last two were applied in the health care domain. In the present study and in order to stimulate basic research as well as to understand the information flow and the management process of clinical data, we started to analyze the clinical practice of the HS_CHC using qualitative methods. Direct observation (ethnography) of the current work practices, analysis of documentation and unstructured interviews based on open-ended questions with users were used. A preliminary specification of the new solution was drafted using information obtained from direct observation and documentation analysis. These techniques were used during the first three months, and the data were collected by the researcher using a specific report. After this phase, qualitative interviews and several focus groups with HCPs and hemophiliac patients, to explore their perceptions about the new system and to capture their needs, were conducted. Three nurses, two physicians and three patients were involved in six focus groups carried out during the following six months. The data were used to complement the preliminary specification and was converted in a preliminary domain model by the researcher. Specific unstructured interviews with patients were also conducted in an informal setting, while they waited for their appointments, as well as with the administrative staff, in their work place. Ethnographic methods were used in all exploratory study phases, since they produce results with greater accuracy when combined with other methods [46]. Basically we used a different source of data (‘data triangulation’) in order to ensure richness in the working material, reducing at the same time the inherent weaknesses of individual methods. After this exploratory study analysis we concluded that although departmental IS have sometimes been interfaced in order to transfer some data among a patient registration system, a laboratory system and a medical system, this was usually based on ad-hoc activities without the implementation of a global communication concept. 3.2.2 Evolutionary design Based on the results of the exploratory study supported by the GT approach, we outlined the preliminary requirements document and the domain model. In order to validate and consequently complement the domain model we applied the three different analysis and validation methods (‘methods triangulation’), Fig. 2. The combination of these three methods was a deliberate choice to ensure richness in the working material and a possibility to collect as many aspects as possible. The order by which they were applied was a planned choice too and will be explained in the next subsections. 3.2.2.1 First method: object-oriented system analysis First, we chose an OOSA method as an object-oriented (OO) environment is an appropriate representation method of a real-life entity or abstraction [50] and would allow the incorporation of new components based, for instance, on incremental solution and evolutionary design. Thinking about the environment in terms of objects comes naturally to people and OOSA has been also successfully applied in different HISs projects [50–57]. Among this, the UML was the notation chosen since it is an OO design technique representing a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of systems [58,59]. One example of this phase results is the high-level use-case diagram (including insertion tasks) that is depicted in Fig. 3 . After drawing these representations, users were invited to evaluate the use-case models. For this evaluation, open-ended focus group interviews [46,61] were conducted with different groups of users (patients, nurses and physicians). The process was open-ended since the interviews were not guided by pre-defined questions; nevertheless they were supported and oriented by models to stimulate discussion. In order to simplify and help the users in this process, during the discussion, some functionalities were converted in small stories (scenarios) using natural language. We are sensible to the fact that use-case diagrams represent abstract models and consequently they could be unintelligible for people without computing science background. In order to workaround this problem, we introduced additional activities to complement a process of RE, based on TA methods. 3.2.2.2 Second method: task analysis Based on results obtained with first method, we applied another to complement the domain model, in order to validate the functionalities and consequently to identify the sequences of sub-functionality within a specific functionality. Leading the users through a small number of scenarios representing sequences of events in the application domain can help to explore the key aspects affecting the requirements. We believe that the task analysis (TA) approach has the power to help in this aspect. There are many types of TA and diverse techniques provide different types of data for analysis [62]. We applied a hierarchical task analysis (HTA), developed by Annett et al. [63], that has the benefits of being readily understandable by a wide people background that normally think about their work as a structured hierarchy of tasks. While the lack of syntax can be said to limit its expressiveness because it does not include the constructs of more formal meddling languages, HTA can also be seen as a more powerful medium for communication in that the analyst is free to express the user's task without syntactical constraints (Ormerod et al., 1998 in [64]). In our particular case, the TA was performed on user data, gathered during the first phase of the requirements engineering process and represented by use-case diagrams, Fig. 2. This analysis began with a statement of the user definition of each task. A complete list of actions needed to perform each task was subsequently produced. Users were then asked to first explain their primary goal when accomplishing a specific task in their work. After that, and based on the data resulting from the system analysis process in the first phase, a TA was performed and represented through HTA notation. We applied this technique (HTA) to tasks performed by our three human actors – nurse, patient and physician – choosing more error prone functionalities, i.e. data insertion tasks. One example of the obtained HTA model about “register treatment” is illustrated in Fig. 4 . The task models resulting from this phase were then reviewed by users: three nurses, two physicians and three patients were directly involved in this review process. They were asked to “think aloud” and verbalize how they would perform each task whilst they look at the models. The resulting information was registered and used to refine the task model, in combination with information obtained from observation and discussion with users. This cycle was repeated until we noticed that the model was not evolving anymore, which happened after three iterations. The use of this type of analysis proved to be a practical way of involving users allowing a better understanding of the human factors involved in our system and fostered an easier incorporation of the notion of usability engineering in the process of requirement engineering. Subsequently, this method assumes particular importance on the discovering process of the users’ tacit knowledge. 3.2.2.3 Third method: prototyping In order to provide a contextual framework that serves to focus the discussion, to help users verify their understanding, as well as to test the overall interaction metaphor, we decided to apply a prototyping technique in the last phase of the RE process. There are different types of prototypes and we applied a horizontal prototype (or user interface prototype) since it represents a model of the outer shell of an entire system, with many features but with very little processing behind them. This prototype, implemented in HTML and JavaScript, showed all items described in the domain model and how these changed as a result of user interaction. Besides, in prototype development, we referred to principles of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) design [65–67] and structured the information on the screen in a logical and consistent manner, corresponding to the order in which this information appear in paper-based files. Moreover, to help the users in building a mental model of the new system, the information is presented in a known and understandable manner in accordance with sequence information captured in the TA phase [68]. The appearance of one prototype interface screen is demonstrated in Fig. 5 . To evaluate the result of this phase, we discussed the prototype in an open-ended focus group [61,69]. First of all, and in order to stimulate discussion, the prototype was presented to users. Based on this, the users suggested and debated changes, and recommended other new functionalities. The resulting information was integrated in the prototype and, after that, a new discussion took place. This cycle was repeated until we noticed that the prototype was not evolving anymore, which happened after two iterations. Modeling the external features of a HIS with a horizontal prototype greatly enhances communication between the requirements engineer and the users. This opportune interaction sometimes results in more concrete outputs, and users normally find it easier to respond to a suggested approach demonstrated by a prototype, than to define their requirements with the system represented by an abstract model. With this experiment, we concluded that the prototype is the easiest tool for HCPs participation in a requirements engineering process of a HIS. 4 Results The results of the evolutionary design process of a WbIS for managing the clinical information in hemophilia care may be divided into two distinct parts: the list of high-level requirements identified and the conceptual model of domain. 4.1.1 High-level requirements identified A list of 48 high-level requirements obtained from multiple methods was presented and grouped by actor: 38 requirements were identified or validated in the first step, 2 were identified in the second step, and 8 were identified in the last step. Table 1 presents a resultant triangulation matrix that lists high-level requirements on one dimension and the three different analysis and validation methods on the other dimension. This (triangulation matrix) indicates which of the methods was responsible for the identification of the requirement (x); and after its identification, if it had confirmation by one of the subsequent methods (+) or if it was not considered (NA). For example, requirements P1, P2 and P3 were identified in the first step and were confirmed in the second and third steps. This might indicate that they are core requirements. Requirements P4 and P5 were identified in the first step; they were not considered in the second step and had confirmation in the third step. Thus, they might also be core requirements. In the second method they were not considered since we applied the TA method only to insertion tasks performed by human actors as they are more error prone functionalities. The requirement P6 was discovered only in the third step, which could indicate that it is a dependent and/or emergent requirement. This type of requirements which emerge with the users’ understanding of the system development during the design process are denominated ‘emergent requirements’ [30]. Different actors were identified: physician, nurse and patient represent the human actors; IHIS, MIS and ClinidataXXI, represent non-human actors, i.e. other existing ISs that will be integrated with WbIS. Patients have an individualized password protected home page, which can only be accessed by themselves or, in case of children, aged people or illiterates, by a caregiver. For example, when a patient receives a treatment with an infusion of coagulation-factor concentrate (CFC), he/she can access his/her personal page and enter details about that treatment (P1), associated bleeding episodes (P2) and the amount and batch number of CFC administered (P3). If the treatment takes place in HTC, these data could be registered by a nurse (N6:N8) who also has an individualized password. The patient's page shows a recommended treatment regimen for prophylaxis or immune-tolerance as well as information on bleeding episodes management (P5). These treatment protocols are entered by a physician and can be up-dated at any time (D1). The physician, normally a hematologist doctor, registers and views a lot of information specific of this pathology and related with the patient (D1:D26). The HIS, MIS and ClinidataXXI represent non-human actors and they register some data (M1, M2; C1:C3; I1, I2). 4.1.2 The general domain model The obtained general domain model was represented through a class diagram of UML notation. This diagram represents the static structure showing object classes, attributes, as well as relationships between those object classes. We identified different kinds of information that were grouped in three big components: patient information, treatment information and CFC-Stock information, Fig. 6 . In the patient information component, besides patient personal data (coming from IHIS), it is also important to collect the data obtained from the doctor appointments and prescribed medication (coming from MIS); as well as all historical information about pathological, virology, and inhibitor exams (coming from Clinidata XXI). These data will be registered in the WbIS automatically by non-human actors. Furthermore, regarding the patient, it is also necessary to store additional data as: bleeding diagnosis, life quality, family-tree, pathologic record, joint condition, and so on. Patients’ data are stored with a unique identification; and each patient can undergo many treatments. The treatments can be on-demand, prophylactic or immune-tolerance. On-demand treatments have associated bleeding episodes (in a joint, muscle or mucosa). On the other hand, treatments can be made at home or at the HTC. The registration of this data was made by the patient or his/her caregiver (in case of home treatment) or by a nurse (in case of hospital treatment). Usually, treatments consist of infusion of blood products, the coagulation-factor concentrates (CFC), which are in stock; thus, functionality concerning the management of blood products inventory should also be integrated. When a blood product arrives at the HTC, a nurse registers its data into the system (name of product, data of reception, batch number, number of units per batch, validity); on the other hand, a blood product can be in different places, as it can be given to patients for home treatment (patient stock) or stayed in the hospital (hospital stock). When a blood product is administered in the sequence of a treatment, the system should register this occurrence and automatically update the stock level. When the stock level reaches the safety stock, the system will send an alert so that a new order is placed. 5 Discussion In this study, we used an evolutionary design process in order to specify the requirements document of a WbIS for managing the clinical information in hemophilia care, and to define a more accurate and realistic domain model in this field. The user-centered requirements engineering methodology based on three different analysis and validation methods was used in an iterative design approach based on the triangulation work. As stated before, the triangulation approach has two main objectives: to confirm results with data from other sources, and to find new data to obtain a more complete solution. Validation of results is achieved when results from one method are confirmed by results from other method. Completeness of results is achieved when one method presents results which have not been found with other method. We involved the same group of users using different analysis and validation methods to confirm the previous results (validation) and consequently to complement the data with new results (completeness). Each method was applied with the same users, in the same environment but in different times. As shown in Fig. 7 , and according to the triangulation matrix presented in Table 1, the results of some parts of the study were validated by the results from other parts, and all parts combined contributed to improve and complete the results about the domain model. With this methodological approach, the requirements triangulation not only contributed for the process of elicitation and validation of the system requirements but also allowed to look across all methods used and decide what requirements are critical for the system success. For example, all requirements identified in the first step and confirmed in the second and third steps should be considered as core requirements. The requirements that were discovered only in the third step probably are dependent and/or emergent requirements. Usually, this type of requirements which emerge with the users’ understanding of the system development during the design process is associated with tacit knowledge and of difficult elicitation. With this study, we also concluded that the HCPs had severe difficulties in predicting their expectations using situations based on abstract models, as UML notation. Indeed, design representation principles emphasize the importance of using representations that are easy to understand for all the stakeholders, and UML notation is obviously not appropriate in this respect. On the other hand, the prototype proved to be the most adequate tool for HCPs participation in a requirements engineering process of a HIS, greatly enhancing communication between the requirements engineer and the users. The exploratory study supported by GT combined with requirements triangulation based on three well-known methods provides a practical framework for understanding and considering user perspectives in the initial part of the development, and transforming these needs into detailed requirements specifications, i.e., the conceptual domain model. However, this approach is time-consuming, but we believe that this disadvantage is largely balanced by the good results, since the errors or ambiguities in this initial step turn out to be costly in the future. For this reason, the application of this methodology in its complete form should be circumscribed to a complex problem characterized by unclear requirements and to support the development of new IS, and not the redesign of existing ones. Furthermore, this approach can help dealing with the basic assumption that results from the “task–artifact cycle” defended by Carroll et al. [31]. 6 Conclusion In the medical informatics literature, one of the identified reasons for information system failures and unsuccessful results is a lack of systematic consideration of human and other non-technology issues throughout design or implementation process [10–12]. Several authors emphasize the need for UCD development of health information systems and argue for an early user involvement [10,12,33,34]. The UCD approach consists in creating systems that are modeled in conformity with the characteristics and tasks of the potential users. UCD has given rise to many forms of design practices in which various characteristics of the context of use are considered. In this work, we illustrated the use of user-centered requirements engineering framework that supports the development process of a WbIS to assist the hemophilia patient care in the hematology service of a Portuguese regional hospital. This study was developed along two years, and during the first nine months, we made an exploratory study based on a GT approach, using several qualitative methods. These qualitative methods, such as ethnography and focus groups, have the ability to capture experiences, emotions, and human interaction processes through the inductive collection of one subsequent rigorous analysis of information from the individuals’ perspective [34]. In this stage the ethnographic study revealed important process details that were missed by other requirements elicitation techniques, specifically analysis of documentation and unstructured interviews. In the health care domain, ethnography is a very important method for requirements elicitation, however it is not a complete approach on its own and it should be used in complement to other approaches. After this exploratory study, we performed an evolutionary design based on constant development and refinement of the generic domain model and requirements document. Different methods based on triangulation work using the UCD principles were used. First, we chose an OOSA method since it is an appropriate method to represent the real-life entity or abstraction and use-case diagram of UML notation to identify and represent the individual interactions with systems through actor and use-case notation. As a second method we chose a model-based TA as it is a good method to capture and understand the sequences of the sub-tasks (sub-functionality) within one specific task (functionality) and thus enabled us to capture the details about the task. In a complex domain such as healthcare, it is necessary to provide a contextual framework that serves to focus the discussion and analysis. Hence, we chose in the last phase a prototyping technique in order to validate the achieved solution and consequently analyze users’ preferences concerning user interfaces. The ‘between-methods triangulation’ in a sequential combination helped us to achieve those goals and the three used different types of analysis and validation methods contributed for the domain model design that will support the development of the WbIS in hemophilia care. These three methods together proved to have great value for the design of our system allowing different views of the same problem. Although the first method based on UML notation represents the standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing and documenting the artifacts of any system, its models must be avoided in the validation process with users without computing knowledge as it is in general the case of HCPs. In fact, we verified that the usage of abstract terminologies (like UML) in the validation process can confuse and intimidate users and little feedback is obtained, since users do not react, and sometimes just agree when they do not understand our language. The second method turned out to be a practical way in the process of understanding the human factors involved in the tasks. It is a more powerful medium for communication in that the requirement engineer is free to express users’ tasks without syntactical constraints. Little new functionalities were added in this step, yet very important information details were collected with this method. Finally, prototyping proved to be the easiest tool to involve the user in a requirement engineering process contributing to the identification of new high-level functionalities and definition of user interfaces. The result of this study, the conceptual model, was implemented using open source technologies, and followed the principles of an agile development approach, more specifically the eXtreme Programming (XP). This approach was chosen by its proximity to the UCD practices, getting a quick feedback from the user through the testing of the small software versions obtained in different iterations. The technological solution is a user-friendly web application that allows communication among hemophilia patients and HCPs, and makes information on treatment's effectiveness, and patient clinical data, as well as other disease related information available. On one hand, it offers HCPs analytical tools to transform data into information, and mine relevant information through data queries. On the other hand, using a user-friendly web application, patients can have direct access to relevant information, allowing them to view their clinical history, as well as introduce home-therapy data. Thus, the new system has improved the process of information managing associated with the clinical practice, since it allows clinicians quickly and easily access a set of meaningful data. Additionally the system provides a set of alerts to abnormal situations, or to those that require a check by a clinician. This happens, for example, when the level of safety stock is reached, or when a patient introduces a treatment registry. For the patients, the system also brought additional benefits, as it allows recording and sending their treatments data, when previously they would have to be recorded on paper and delivered at the hospital. This helped to improve the quality of life for patients, putting them in constant contact with the hospital. Finally, there is the possibility to automatically manage the stocks of CFCs used in treatments, which relieves the nurses from those manual, time consuming and error prone tasks. Based on the experience gained with this project, we conclude that requirements engineering in health care domain is a really complex task; however, we believe that using a UCD in a triangulation work in such a critical step is a good design practice.

        "doc_abstract": "Local and national haemophilia registries are powerful instruments to support the healthcare and researchers and improve the communication between Comprehensive Haemophilia Diagnostic and Treatment Centres (HTCs) and patients. Hemo@care is an example of a Local Haemophilia Registry Systems (LHR-Sys) based on the Web, developed in collaboration with a HTC located in Portugal, to support the haemophilia treatments registry, collect and manage the clinical information and provide mechanisms to control the clotting factor concentrates (CFC) stock. To extend this solution (the hemo@care) to other Portuguese HTCs and consequently to meet the preconditions to create a National Haemophilia Registry Systems (NHR-Sys), a study based on a questionnaire was carried out at nationwide. This study aims to assess the conditions and motivations of people with haemophilia (PWH) geographically scattered throughout the country, to use a potential Web-enabled registry with the purpose of replacing the traditional paper-diaries, to understand their judgment about a potential NHR-Sys currently non-existent in Portugal, and at the same time, to characterize demographically and pathologically those people at the nationwide. The results based on the analysis of 168 responses (response rate of 31%) confirmed the high prevalence of the disease in haemophilia A (75%) compared with haemophilia B (11.3%) and a large incidence in the severe levels, or the existence of people with mild severity without diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, the results also revealed the need, conditions and motivation for using a registry system by PWH; thus it is deemed to justify the extension of the hemo@care to other HTCs in Portugal and consequently to create the NHR-Sys. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",

In order to understand the motivations of end-users prior to implementation and to analyze the behavior after a change (post-implementation), a study based on a questionnaire was carried out. The sample included 67 users of SAP R/3 that were present throughout the process. Considering the results, we can conclude that the implementation of SAP R/3 in MPO was successful, and the respondents consider their work more productive and achieve easier access to information. The existence of a solid team to support the project was established as a major facilitator in the whole process, in opposing with the limited time and lack of training that emerged as barriers to the implementation. It was also found that the learning period assumes a high importance in the success of the implementation, once increasing the training time reduces the need for support to the end-users. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

It performs, as well, the automation of all administrative jobs and the inherent procedures for the distribution of this information, increasing its accessibility, reliability, up-to-dateness and decreasing the bureaucratic burden. With this application it is possible to speed up some routine activities, decreasing the need for manual, exhaustive and repetitive tasks. The general goal of this work is to determine how and to what extent different groups of users within an academic department can interchange information using the Web; in order to attain this goal, we have developed a framework with three essential aspects, that will be briefly presented: contents, design and implementation.",
