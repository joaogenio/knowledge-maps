Communicated by Steven Wang We examine linear sums of primitive roots and their inverses in finite fields. In particular, we refine a result by Li and Han, and show that every p > 13 has a pair of primitive roots a and b such that a + b and a − 1 + b − 1 are also primitive roots mod p. MSC 11T30 11L03 Keywords Primitive roots Finite fields Character sums Prime sieve 1 Introduction Let F q denote the finite field of order q, a power of the prime p. The proliferation of primitive elements of F q gives rise to many interesting properties. For example, it was proved in [4] that for any non-zero α , β , ϵ ∈ F q the equation ϵ = a α + b β is soluble in primitive elements a , b provided that q > 61 . Since a is primitive if and only if a − 1 , its multiplicative inverse in F q , is primitive, one may look for linear relations amongst primitive elements and their inverses and, as in the above example, seek a lower bound on q beyond which such relations hold – this is the purpose of the current paper. Given arbitrary non-zero elements u , v ∈ F q , call a pair ( a , b ) of primitive elements of F q ( u , v ) -primitive if additionally the elements u a + v b and v a − 1 + u b − 1 are each primitive. The task is to find an asymptotic expression for N = N ( q , u , v ) , defined as the number of ( u , v ) -primitive pairs ( a , b ) in F q . In the situation in which F q is a prime field, i.e., q = p , this problem was introduced by Li and Han [7]. In that context, a , b are considered to be integers in I p = { 1 , 2 , … , p − 1 } with inverses a − 1 , b − 1 ∈ I p . Similarly, u , v can be taken to be in I p . To state the result of [7] we introduce some notation. For a positive integer m let ω ( m ) be the number of distinct prime divisors of m and W ( m ) = 2 ω ( m ) be the number of square-free divisors of m. Further, define θ ( m ) as ϕ ( m ) / m , where ϕ is Euler's function, and τ ( m ) = ∏ l | m ( 1 − 1 l − 1 + 1 ( l − 1 ) 2 ) , where the product is taken over all ω ( m ) distinct prime divisors l of m. Theorem 1 Li–Han Let p be an odd prime and n any integer in I p . Set θ = θ ( p − 1 ) , τ = τ ( p − 1 ) and W = W ( p − 1 ) . Then (1.1) | N ( p , 1 , n ) − θ 3 τ ⋅ ( p − 1 ) 2 | ≤ 5 θ 4 W 4 p 3 / 2 . Li and Han gave the following as corollaries to Theorem 1. Corollary 1 Li–Han Every sufficiently large p has primitive roots a and b such that both a + b and a − 1 + b − 1 are also primitive. Also, every sufficiently large p has primitive roots a and b such that both a − b and b − 1 − a − 1 are also primitive. We establish an improved estimate for N ( q , u , v ) in the case of a general finite field. Theorem 2 Let q > 2 be a prime power. Set θ = θ ( q − 1 ) , τ = τ ( q − 1 ) , W = W ( q − 1 ) . Then, for arbitrary non-zero u , v ∈ F q , (1.2) | N ( q , u , v ) − θ 3 τ ⋅ ( q − 1 ) q | ≤ θ 4 W 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) q . The principal improvement in Theorem 2 over Theorem 1 is the reduction from W 4 to W 3 in the error term. Its effect can be described as follows. Let S be the set of prime powers q such that, for any pair of non-zero elements ( u , v ) in F q , there exists a ( u , v ) -primitive pair in F q . Explicit calculations using (1.1) guarantee that all q exceeding 5.7 × 10 364 (or with ω ( q − 1 ) > 150 ) are in S . On the other hand, using (1.2), we conclude that all prime powers q exceeding 1.7 × 10 84 (or with ω ( q − 1 ) > 46 ) are in S . For existence questions it is clear that the interest in Theorems 1 and 2 lies in their lower bounds. Hence we shall describe a method that, while not delivering an asymptotic estimate, establishes a lower bound for N ( q , u , v ) . This yields a non-trivial lower bound applicable to a wider range of prime powers q. Let Rad ( m ) be the radical of m, i.e., the product of the distinct primes dividing a positive integer m, and let Rad ( q − 1 ) be expressed as k p 1 ⋯ p s for some divisor k and distinct primes p 1 , … , p s . Define δ 4 = 1 − 4 ∑ i = 1 s 1 p i . Theorem 3 Suppose δ 4 > 0 . Set θ = θ ( k ) , τ = τ ( k ) , W = W ( k ) . Then N ( q , u , v ) ≥ δ 4 θ 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) { τ q − θ W 3 q } . A consequence of Theorem 3 is that all prime powers q exceeding 6.9 × 10 10 are in S . A stronger conclusion, however, can be drawn by introducing a subset T ⊆ S . Define a single primitive element a to be ( u , v ) -primitive if, additionally, u a + v a − 1 is primitive, and define T as the set of prime powers q such that, for any pair of non-zero elements ( u , v ) in F q , there exists a ( u , v ) -primitive element in F q (in the above sense). Easily, if a is a ( u , v ) -primitive element, then ( a , a − 1 ) is a ( u , v ) -primitive pair so that, indeed, T ⊆ S . For even q the existence of ( 1 , 1 ) -primitive elements was the simpler topic 2 2 The harder problem treated in [9] and [3] concerned the existence of a ( 1 , 1 ) -primitive element in an extension field F q n which is also normal over the base field F q . considered by Wang, Cao and Feng in [9]. Their investigations were completed by Cohen [3] – see also the reference to [2] at the end of Section 7. Results on the existence of ( 1 , 1 ) -primitive elements in F q have recently been given by Liao, Li and Pu [8]. In this paper we use a sieving method and some computation to establish the following theorem. Theorem 4 Define (1.3) E T = { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 19 , 25 , 29 , 31 , 37 , 41 , 43 , 49 , 61 , 81 , 97 , 121 , 169 } , E S = { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 13 } . Then E T is the set of prime powers not in T and E S is the set of prime powers not in S . This generalises and resolves completely the problem posed by Li and Han in [7]. From Theorem 4 we can easily deduce the following, which resolves completely the ‘sufficiently large’ of Corollary 1. Corollary 2 Let q be a prime power. (i) Suppose q ∉ { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 13 , 25 , 121 } . Then there is a primitive element a in F q such that a + a − 1 is primitive. (ii) Suppose q ∉ { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 25 , 61 , 121 } . Then there is a primitive element a in F q such that a − a − 1 is primitive. (iii) Suppose q ∉ { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 13 } . Then there are primitive elements a and b in F q such that both a + b and a − 1 + b − 1 are also primitive. (iv) Suppose q ∉ { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 13 } . Then there are primitive elements a and b in F q such that both a − b and b − 1 − a − 1 are also primitive. The outline of this paper is as follows. In §2 we introduce some notation that, in §3, allows us to prove Theorem 2. In §4 we introduce a sieve and prove Theorem 3. In §5 we introduce some asymmetry and prove Theorem 5, which is sometimes stronger in practice than Theorem 3. In §6 we prove Theorems 6 and 7, which are criteria for membership of T . Finally, in §7 and §8 we present theoretical and computational results that prove Theorem 4. 2 Preliminaries To set Theorem 3 and subsequent results in context, we introduce an extension of the concept of a primitive element in F q . Let e be a divisor of q − 1 . Then a non-zero element a ∈ F q is defined to be e-free if a = b d , where b ∈ F q and d | e , implies d = 1 . This property depends only on Rad ( e ) . In particular, a is primitive if and only if it is ( q − 1 ) -free. Given e | q − 1 , the characteristic function λ e for the subset of e-free elements of F q ⁎ is expressed in terms of the multiplicative characters of F q and is given by λ e ( a ) = θ ( e ) ∑ d | e μ ( d ) ϕ ( d ) ∑ χ ∈ Γ d χ ( a ) . Here Γ d denotes the set of ϕ ( d ) multiplicative characters of order d. Consistent with dependence only on Rad ( e ) is the fact that the only non-zero contributions to λ e ( a ) can arise from square-free values of d: we can assume throughout that every value of d considered is square-free. Finally, we generalise the definition of δ 4 used in Theorem 3. (2.1) δ j = δ j ( p 1 , … , p s ) = 1 − j ∑ i = 1 s 1 p s . Specifically, in the sequel, we shall employ δ 4 , δ 3 and δ 2 . 3 Asymptotic estimate for ( u , v ) -primitive pairs In this section we prove Theorem 2. Assume that q and non-zero elements u , v of F q are given. Writing λ = λ q − 1 , we have from §2 that N : = N ( q , u , v ) = ∑ a , b ≠ 0 λ ( a ) λ ( b ) λ ( u a + v b ) λ ( v a − 1 + u b − 1 ) . Hence (3.1) N = θ 4 ∑ d j | q − 1 , j = 1 , … , 4 μ ( d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) μ ( d 3 ) μ ( d 4 ) ϕ ( d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ϕ ( d 3 ) ϕ ( d 4 ) ∑ χ j ∈ Γ j j = 1 , … , 4 S , where (3.2) S = ∑ a ≠ 0 ∑ b ≠ 0 χ 1 ( a ) χ 2 ( b ) χ 3 ( u a + b v ) χ 4 ( v a − 1 + u b − 1 ) = ∑ a ≠ 0 ∑ b ≠ 0 χ 1 ( a b ) χ 2 ( b ) χ 3 ( u a b + v b ) χ 4 ( v a − 1 b − 1 + u b − 1 ) = ∑ a ≠ 0 ∑ b ≠ 0 χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 χ 4 − 1 ( b ) χ 1 χ 4 − 1 ( a ) χ 3 χ 4 ( u a + v ) . If χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 χ 4 − 1 ≠ χ 0 , the principal character, then the sum over b in (3.2) is zero, whence S = 0 . So in what follows assume χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 χ − 1 4 = χ 0 . If χ 1 χ 4 − 1 = χ 3 χ 4 = χ 0 , then χ 1 = χ 2 = χ 4 = χ 3 − 1 and S = ( q − 1 ) ( q − 2 ) . Hence d 1 = d 2 = d 3 = d 4 and, as in [7, p. 7], the contribution of all such terms in (3.1) to N is (3.3) θ 4 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) ( q − 2 ) ∑ d | q − 1 μ 4 ( d ) ϕ 3 ( d ) = θ 3 τ ⋅ ( q − 1 ) ( q − 2 ) . If χ 1 χ 4 − 1 = χ 0 (so that χ 2 χ 3 = χ 0 ) but χ 3 χ 4 ≠ χ 0 , then S = − ( q − 1 ) ∑ a ≠ 0 χ 3 χ 4 ( u a + v ) = − χ 3 χ 4 ( v ) ( q − 1 ) , so that | S | = q − 1 . Similarly, | S | = q − 1 when χ 3 χ 4 = χ 0 but χ 1 χ 4 − 1 ≠ χ 0 . Finally, if η 1 = χ 1 χ 4 − 1 ≠ χ 0 and η 2 = χ 3 χ 4 ≠ χ 0 , then S = ( q − 1 ) ∑ a ≠ 0 η 1 ( a ) η 2 ( u a + v ) = η 1 η 2 ( v ) η 1 ( − 1 / u ) ( q − 1 ) J ( η 1 , η 2 ) , where J denotes the Jacobi sum, so that | S | = ( q − 1 ) q . We now obtain a bound for | M | , where M is the sum of terms in (3.1) corresponding to characters of square-free orders with χ 4 = χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 excluding those with χ 1 = χ 2 = χ 4 = χ 3 − 1 (which were accounted for in (3.3)). Thus, we sum over all characters χ 1 , χ 2 , χ 3 and allow χ 4 to be defined by χ 4 = χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 , in which case d 4 is the degree of the resulting character χ 4 . In general, d 4 is not determined by d 1 , d 2 , d 3 so we simply use the bound ϕ ( d 4 ) ≥ 1 . For simplicity, we use the bound | S | ≤ ( q − 1 ) = ( q − 1 ) q − ( q − 1 ) ( q − 1 ) whenever χ 1 = χ 4 (so χ 2 χ 3 = χ 0 ) and include terms with χ 1 = χ 2 = χ 4 = χ 3 − 1 , but the bound | S | ≤ ( q − 1 ) q , otherwise. Thus (3.4) | M | ≤ θ 4 ( W 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) q − | L | ) , where L accounts for the discrepancy in terms with χ 1 = χ 4 so that | L | = ∑ d 1 , d 2 | ( q − 1 ) | μ ( d 1 ) | μ 2 ( d 2 ) ϕ ( d 1 ) ϕ 2 ( d 2 ) ∑ χ 1 ∈ Γ d 1 χ 2 ∈ Γ d 2 ( q − 1 ) ( q − 1 ) . Hence (3.5) | L | = ( q − 1 ) ( q − 1 ) W ∑ d | q − 1 μ ( d ) 2 ϕ ( d ) = W ( q − 1 ) ( q − 1 ) θ . Combining (3.3), (3.4), (3.5) we deduce that (3.6) | N − θ 3 τ ⋅ ( q − 1 ) ( q − 2 ) | ≤ θ 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) { θ W 3 q − W ( q − 1 ) } . The implicit upper bound in (1.2) is immediate from (3.6). The lower bound follows from (3.6) since 2 τ < W ⋅ ( q − 1 ) . Corollary 3 The prime power q is in S whenever q > W 6 ( q − 1 ) . Proof By looking at the factors from each prime l | q − 1 we see that τ ( q − 1 ) > θ ( q − 1 ) . □ 4 Sieving for ( u , v ) -primitive pairs We now introduce the sieving machinery and prove Theorem 3, which is an improvement on Theorem 2. As in §1, write Rad ( q − 1 ) = k p 1 ⋯ p s , where p 1 , … , p s are the sieving primes. For divisors e 1 , … , e 4 of q − 1 , denote by N ( e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 ) the number of non-zero pairs a , b ∈ F q for which, respectively, a , b , u a + v b , v a − 1 + u b − 1 are e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 -free. When e 1 = e 2 = e 3 = e 4 = e abbreviate N ( e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 ) to N e . In particular, N = N q − 1 . Lemma 1 We have N q − 1 ≥ ∑ i = 1 s { N ( p i k , k , k , k ) + N ( k , p i k , k , k ) + N ( k , k , p i k , k ) + N ( k , k , k , p i k ) } − ( 4 s − 1 ) N k . Hence, with δ 4 defined by (2.1) , (4.1) N q − 1 ≥ ∑ i = 1 s { [ N ( p i k , k , k , k ) − θ ( p i ) N k ] + [ N ( k , p i k , k , k ) − θ ( p i ) N k ] + [ N ( k , k , p i k , k ) − θ ( p i ) N k ] + [ N ( k , k , k , p i k ) − θ ( p i ) N k ] } + δ 4 N k . As with previous applications of the sieving method, we need an estimate for the various differences appearing in (4.1). Somewhat surprisingly, in this instance, they vanish. Lemma 2 For i = 1 , … , s , N ( p i k , k , k , k ) − θ ( p i ) N k = 0 . Similarly, the other differences in (4.1) vanish. Proof As in (3.1) (4.2) N ( p i k , k , k , k ) − θ ( p i ) N k = θ ( p i ) θ 4 ( k ) ∑ d j | k , j = 1 , … , 4 μ ( p i d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) μ ( d 3 ) μ ( d 4 ) ϕ ( p i d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ϕ ( d 3 ) ϕ ( d 4 ) ∑ χ 1 ∈ Γ p i d 1 χ j ∈ Γ d j j = 2 , … , 4 S , where S is given by (3.2). Now, in every character sum S appearing in (4.2), χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 χ 4 − 1 has degree divisible by p i (since this is so for χ 1 , but not any of χ 2 , χ 3 , χ 4 ), whence S = 0 . □ Since, by Lemmas 1 and 2, we have N ( q , u , v ) = N q − 1 ≥ δ 4 N k , the argument of Theorem 2 (based on (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) but with k instead of q − 1 ) yields Theorem 3. As a consequence of Theorem 3 we deduce an extension of Corollary 3. Corollary 4 Suppose δ 4 > 0 . Then the prime power q is in S whenever q > W 6 ( k ) . Proof As for Corollary 3. □ Of course, the assumption δ 4 > 0 is critical for the deduction of Corollary 4. Once this holds, unusually (because of Lemma 2), the criterion does not depend on δ 4 . 5 An asymmetric sieve We now obtain a result, in Theorem 5, that is sometimes, though not always, stronger than Theorem 3. We do this by considering some asymmetrical situations in §4. Lemma 3 With notation as in § 4 set θ = θ ( k ) , τ = τ ( k ) , W = W ( k ) . Further, write θ q − 1 for θ ( q − 1 ) and N k , q − 1 for N ( k , k , k , q − 1 ) . Then N k , q − 1 ≥ θ 2 θ q − 1 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) { τ q − θ W 3 q } . Proof As at (3.1) (5.1) N k , q − 1 = θ 3 θ q − 1 ∑ d 1 , d 2 , d 3 | k , d 4 | q − 1 μ ( d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) μ ( d 3 ) μ ( d 4 ) ϕ ( d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ϕ ( d 3 ) ϕ ( d 4 ) ∑ χ j ∈ Γ d j j = 1 , … , 4 S , where S is given by (3.2) and so is zero unless χ 4 = χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 . Now, if d 4 ∤ k then the degree of χ 4 is not a divisor of k and hence χ 4 ≠ χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 , whence S = 0 . It follows that, in (5.1), we can restrict d 4 to divisors of k. The lemma then follows as in the proof of Theorem 3. □ We may take k = Rad ( q − 1 ) in Lemma 3 to obtain another proof of the lower bound of Theorem 2. The (obvious) asymmetric version of Lemma 1 features δ 3 in place of δ 4 . Lemma 4 We have N q − 1 ≥ ∑ i = 1 s { N ( p i k , k , k , q − 1 ) + N ( k , p i k , k , q − 1 ) + N ( k , k , p i k , q − 1 ) } − ( 3 s − 1 ) N k , q − 1 . Hence, with δ 3 defined by (2.1) (5.2) N q − 1 ≥ ∑ i = 1 s { [ N ( p i k , k , k , q − 1 ) − θ ( p i ) N k , q − 1 ] + [ N ( k , p i k , k , q − 1 ) − θ ( p i ) N k , q − 1 ] + [ N ( k , k , p i k , q − 1 ) − θ ( p i ) N k , q − 1 ] } + δ 3 N k , q − 1 . The various differences in (5.2) do not vanish (cf. Lemma 2) but can be usefully bounded. Lemma 5 For i = 1 , … , s , | N ( p i k , k , k , q ) − θ ( p i ) N k , q − 1 | ≤ 1 p i θ 3 θ q − 1 W 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) q , where θ = θ ( k ) , W = W ( k ) . A similar bound applies to the other differences in (5.2) . Proof In the expansion of Δ = N ( p i k , k , k , q ) − θ ( p i ) N k , q − 1 into character sums S analogous to (4.2) or (5.1), the degree of the χ 1 must be p i d 1 , where d 1 | k . But, since S vanishes unless χ 4 = χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 , we need only include terms in which the degree of χ 4 similarly is p i d 4 , where d 4 | k . Hence (5.3) Δ = θ ( p i ) θ 3 ( k ) θ q − 1 ∑ d j | k , j = 1 , … , 3 μ ( p i d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) μ ( d 3 ) μ ( p i d 4 ) ϕ ( p i d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ϕ ( d 3 ) ϕ ( p i d 4 ) ∑ χ 1 ∈ Γ p i d 1 χ 2 ∈ Γ d 2 , χ 3 ∈ Γ d 3 χ 4 = χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 S , where S is given by (3.2) and the degree of χ 4 is written as p i d 4 with d 4 | k . Since | S | ≤ ( q − 1 ) q for each occurrence in (5.3), and ϕ ( p i d 4 ) ≥ ϕ ( p i ) , it follows that | Δ | ≤ θ 3 ( k ) θ q − 1 θ ( p i ) p i − 1 W 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) q and the result follows because θ ( p i ) / ( p i − 1 ) = 1 / p i . □ Theorem 5 Suppose δ 3 > 0 . Set θ = θ ( k ) , τ = τ ( k ) , W = W ( k ) . Then N ( q , u , v ) ≥ θ 2 θ q − 1 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) { δ 3 τ q − θ W 3 q } . Proof Apply the bounds of Lemmas 3 and 5 to (5.2). We obtain N q ≥ δ 3 θ 2 θ q − 1 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) { τ q − θ W 3 q } − { ∑ i = 1 s 3 p i } θ 3 θ q − 1 W 3 ⋅ ( q − 1 ) q . The result follows since − ∑ i = 1 s ( 3 / p i ) = 1 − δ 3 . □ Generally, Theorem 5 gives a better bound than Theorem 3 because it allows us to choose more sieving primes, i.e., a larger value of s. 6 ( u , v ) -primitive elements For given prime power q and non-zero elements ( u , v ) in F q define M = M ( q , u , v ) as the number of primitive elements in F q such that u a + v a − 1 is also primitive. More generally, for divisors e 1 , e 2 of q − 1 , define M e 1 , e 2 to be the number of (non-zero) elements a ∈ F q such that a is e 1 -free and u a + v a − 1 is e 2 -free and abbreviate M e , e to M e . Then (6.1) M e = θ 2 ∑ d 1 | e ∑ d 2 | e μ ( d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) ϕ ( d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ∑ deg ⁡ χ 1 = d 1 ∑ deg ⁡ χ 2 = d 2 T , where θ = θ ( e ) and T = ∑ a ∈ F q χ 1 ( a ) χ 2 ( u a 2 + v a ) = ∑ a ∈ F q χ 1 χ 2 − 1 ( a ) χ 2 ( u a 2 + v ) . If χ 1 = χ 2 = χ 0 , then T = q − 1 − ε , where ϵ is the number of zeros of u a 2 + b in F q . (Here, ε is 0 or 2 if q is odd and 1 if q is even.) If χ 2 = χ 0 but χ 1 ≠ χ 0 , then | T | ≤ ε . If χ 1 = χ 2 ≠ χ 0 , then | T | ≤ q . If χ 1 ≠ χ 2 and χ 2 ≠ χ 0 , then | T | ≤ 2 q . Hence, from (6.1), (6.2) | M e − θ 2 ⋅ ( q − 1 − ε ) | ≤ θ 2 { 2 q A − q B − ( 2 q − ε ) C + q − ε } . In (6.2), A = ∑ d 1 | e ∑ d 2 | e | μ ( d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) | ϕ ( d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ∑ deg ⁡ χ 1 = d 1 ∑ deg ⁡ χ 2 = d 2 1 = W 2 , where W = W ( e ) . Further, B = ∑ d | e μ 2 ( d ) ϕ 2 ( d ) ∑ deg ⁡ χ = d 1 = ∑ d | e μ 2 ( d ) ϕ ( d ) = 1 / θ . Finally, C = ∑ d | e μ ( d ) ϕ ( d ) ∑ deg ⁡ χ = d 1 = W . It follows that (6.3) | M e − θ 2 ⋅ ( q − 1 − ε ) | ≤ θ 2 { 2 q [ W 2 − W − 1 2 ( 1 θ − 1 ) ] + ε ( W − 1 ) } . We may take e = q − 1 in (6.3) to deduce an asymptotic expression for M ( q , u , v ) (see also [8, Thm. 1.3]), thereby proving the following theorem. Theorem 6 Let q be a prime power and set θ = θ ( q − 1 ) and W = W ( q − 1 ) . Then | M ( q , u , v ) − θ 2 ⋅ ( q − 1 − ε ) | ≤ θ 2 { 2 q [ W 2 − W − 1 2 ( 1 θ − 1 ) ] + ε ( W − 1 ) } . We now introduce the sieve (with the usual notation). First, here is the analogue of Lemma 1. Lemma 6 Define δ 2 by (2.1) . Then M ≥ ∑ i = 1 s { [ M p i k , k − θ ( p i ) M k , k ] + [ M k , p i k − θ ( p i ) M k , k ] } + δ 2 M k , k . Lemma 7 Let θ = θ ( k ) , W = W ( k ) . Then (i) | M p i k , k − θ ( p i ) M k , k | ≤ θ 2 ( 1 − 1 p i ) ⋅ { 2 q ( W 2 − W ) + ε W } . (ii) | M k , p i k − θ ( p i ) M k , k | ≤ 2 ( 1 − 1 p i ) θ 2 W 2 ⋅ q . Proof | M p i k , k − θ ( p i ) M k , k | = ∑ d 1 | k ∑ d 2 | k | μ ( p i d 1 ) μ ( d 2 ) | ϕ ( p i ) ϕ ( d 1 ) ϕ ( d 2 ) ∑ deg ⁡ χ 1 = p i d 1 ∑ deg ⁡ χ 2 = d 2 T , and (i) follows from the bounds on T. Similarly, (ii) holds, since the only character sums involved have χ 1 ≠ χ 2 and χ 2 ≠ χ 0 . □ Theorem 7 Assume q > 3 is a prime power. With θ = θ ( k ) , W = W ( k ) (as in Lemma 7 ), suppose δ 2 > 0 . Then (6.4) M > θ 2 q { q − 2 ( 2 s − 1 δ 2 + 2 ) [ W 2 − W 2 ( 1 − 1 q ) ] } . Hence, if (6.5) q > 2 ( 2 s − 1 δ 2 + 2 ) [ W 2 − W 2 ( 1 − 1 q ) ] , then q ∈ T . Proof Apply Lemma 7 to the bound of Lemma 6. Observe that ∑ i = 1 s ( 1 − 1 p i ) = 1 2 ( 2 s − 1 + δ 2 ) . Hence M ≥ δ 2 θ 2 { 2 q ( 2 s − 1 δ 2 + 1 ) [ W 2 − W 2 ( 1 − ε 2 q ) ] + U } , where U = ( q − 1 − ε ) − { 2 q [ W 2 − W − 1 2 ( 1 θ − 1 ) ] + ε ( W − 1 ) } The inequality (6.4) follows, since W q > ε W + 1 ( ε ≤ 2 ) , certainly for q > 3 . The criterion (6.5) is then immediate. □ 7 Existence proofs In this section we begin to prove Theorem 4 by demonstrating, using the theorems we have established, that all but finitely many q are members of T and S . Specifically, we prove that all but at most 3031 prime powers q are in T and all but at most 532 values of q are not in S . Moreover, the possible exceptions could be listed explicitly (although we do not do so). First, we can show that q ∈ T by establishing that the (stronger) sufficient inequality q > 4 W 4 ( q − 1 ) (derived from Theorem 6) holds whenever ω ( q − 1 ) ≥ 17 , and the inequality q > 4 ( 2 s − 1 δ 2 + 2 ) 2 W 4 ( k ) (derived from Theorem 7) holds with s = 5 whenever 9 ≤ ω ( q − 1 ) ≤ 16 . We therefore only have to consider those q with ω ( q − 1 ) ≤ 8 . Now, for each value of 1 ≤ ω ( q − 1 ) ≤ 8 we find a value of s ∈ [ 1 , ω ( q − 1 ) − 1 ] such that the right-side of (6.5) is minimised – call this q max . Now q − 1 ≥ p 1 p 2 … p ω ( q − 1 ) ) : = q min . We therefore need only check q ∈ ( q min , q max ) . For example, when ω ( q − 1 ) = 8 we choose s = 5 , whence δ 2 ≥ 1 − 2 ( 1 / 7 + 1 / 11 + 1 / 13 + 1 / 17 + 1 / 19 ) > 0.1557 and so q max < 5.15 ⋅ 10 7 . We also have that q min = 9 , 699 , 691 . We enumerate all prime powers in ( q min , q max ) and select those with ω ( q − 1 ) = 8 . There are 49 such values, the largest of which is q = 51 , 269 , 791 . For each of these 49 values we now compute the exact value of δ 2 for each s. For example, for s = 5 and q = 51 , 269 , 791 we have δ 2 > 0.387 – a considerable improvement. We now look to see whether (6.4) holds for these values of q. We find that (6.4) is true for all but 9 values, the largest of which is 31 , 651 , 621 . We continue in this way, the only deviation from the above example being that for ω ( q − 1 ) = 1 we use Theorem 6. Our results are summarised in Table 1 , which lists, for each value of ω ( q − 1 ) , the number of q for which Theorem 7 fails to show that q ∈ T . Table 1 also gives the least and greatest prime and prime power in each category. In total, in Table 1, there are 2942 prime values of q which may not be in T . The prime 2 is excluded (but clearly 2 ∉ T ). The total of 89 (non-prime) prime powers comprise 69 prime squares and 20 higher powers. Unsurprisingly, the latter are powers of small primes as follows: 2 3 , 2 4 , 2 5 , 2 6 , 2 8 , 2 10 , 212, 3 3 , 3 4 , 3 5 , 3 6 , 5 3 , 5 4 , 5 6 , 7 3 , 7 4 , 11 3 , 11 4 , 13 3 , 13 4 , 31 3 . Excluding q = 2 , the above leaves a total of 3031 possible prime powers q as candidates for non-membership. Let C T be the set of these 3031 candidates. We reduce this number substantially in Theorem 8, and, in §9 prove Theorem 4. We can pass our list C T of 3031 possible exceptions through Theorems 2, 3 and 5. Note that these test for membership of S . We find that there are only 532 possible prime powers not in S . At this point it is pertinent to add some remarks on the parity of q. When q is even, a ( 1 , 1 ) -primitive element is the same as a ( 1 , − 1 ) -primitive element. It was proved in [3] that all fields F 2 n , n ≥ 3 , contain a ( 1 , 1 ) -primitive element. This proof was theoretical, except for the values n = 6 and 12 when an explicit ( 1 , 1 ) -primitive element was given. In fact, in the preparation of [3], the first author overlooked previous work of his [2] in which a theoretical proof was given (even in these two difficult cases). An explanation for the oversight is that [2] was framed in the notions of Garbe [5] relating to the order and level of an irreducible polynomial, rather than an element of the field. In fact, for q even, existence was established in [2], Theorem 5.2. In any event, we can assume from now on that q is odd. 8 Computational results In this section we give algorithms and timings for our computations verifying that many q are in T . Let w = u − 1 v and r = a + w a − 1 . Then u a + v a − 1 = u ( a + w a − 1 ) = u r , and if u and v are non-zero elements of F q then w will also be a non-zero element of F q . Thus, to verify if q ∈ T it is sufficient to verify that for all non-zero elements u and w of F q , there exists a primitive element a of F q such that ur is also a primitive element of F q . The transformation of the original problem into one with a multiplicative structure allows discrete logarithms to be used. As primitive elements are easy to characterise using discrete logarithms, this will give rise to important computational savings. Let γ be a primitive element of F q and let log ⁡ v denote the base γ discrete logarithm of the non-zero element v of F q . Let p 1 , p 2 , … , p ω ( q − 1 ) be the distinct prime divisors of q − 1 , and let R be their product (the radical of q − 1 ). If u and r are both non-zero then ur is a primitive element of F q if and only if gcd ⁡ ( log ⁡ u + log ⁡ r , q − 1 ) = 1 , i.e., if and only if log ⁡ u ≢ − log ⁡ r mod p i , i = 1 , … , ω ( q − 1 ) . For a given w, it follows that each primitive element a for which r is non-zero takes care of ∏ i = 1 ω ( q − 1 ) ( p i − 1 ) residue classes of log ⁡ u mod R . The first result of this setup is Algorithm 1 . To maximise efficiency in Algorithm 1 we store the logs we have computed as well as the elements which have already been determined to be primitive so we can first check through our list of stored primitive elements a and only generate more primitive elements as needed. We can write E T (defined in (1.3)) as { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 } ∪ { 7 , 11 , 13 , 19 , 25 , 29 , 37 , 41 , 49 , 81 , 97 } ∪ { 31 , 43 , 61 , 121 , 169 } according to ω ( q − 1 ) . It has been checked by running Algorithm 1 using Magma [1] that E T ∩ T = ∅ and that q ∈ T for all q ∈ C T ∖ E T , ω ( q − 1 ) < . In Table 2 we provide total timings for these checks for all q ∈ C T , grouped by ω ( q − 1 ) , on a 2.6 GHz Intel®Xeon®E5-2670 or similar machine. We found it efficient to store a primitive a and check u ( a + v a − 1 ) for primitivity with the stored a first before generating more primitive elements. Note that we do not need to check all ( u , v ) pairs since u a + v a − 1 = v a − 1 + u ( a − 1 ) − 1 so if there is a ( u , v ) -primitive element there is also a ( v , u ) -primitive element. However, this improvement is made redundant by factoring out u and iterating through only R many. We noticed that if a is a ( u , v ) -primitive element then it is also a ( u ′ , v ′ ) -primitive element when ( v ′ − v ) = − a 2 ( u − u ′ ) . Unfortunately, these observations did not improve the efficiency of our algorithms. We also checked using Algorithm 2 whether q ∈ S for q ∈ E T and found that only 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 13 ∉ S . The computations for these checks took about 1 second using Magma on a 3.4 GHz Intel®Core™i7-3770 or similar machine. Finally, we deduce Corollary 2 by checking which ( u , v ) caused failures in Algorithms 1 and 2. We summarise our results from this section in the following theorem. Theorem 8 All prime powers q with ω ( q − 1 ) < 7 and q ∉ E T are in T and so also in S . There are at most 501 values of q ∉ E T not in T , the largest of which is 31 , 651 , 621 . 9 Improved algorithm to check whether q ∈ T We now introduce a new algorithm to handle the 501 possible exceptions annunciated in Theorem 8. Let L = { 0 , 1 , … , R − 1 } be a complete set of residues modulo R. For i = 1 , … , ω ( q − 1 ) , let L i ′ = { 0 , 1 , … , p i − 1 } be a complete set of residues modulo p i , and let L r , i = { l : l ∈ L ∧ l ≢ − log ⁡ r mod p i } , L r , i ′ = { l : l ∈ L i ′ ∧ l ≢ − log ⁡ r mod p i } . Finally, let L r = ⋂ i = 1 ω ( q − 1 ) L r , i . By construction, the condition gcd ⁡ ( log ⁡ u + log ⁡ r , q − 1 ) = 1 is equivalent to the condition ( log ⁡ u mod R ) ∈ L r . Furthermore, using the Chinese remainder theorem, the number | L r | of elements of the set L r is given by (9.1) | L r | = ∏ i = 1 ω ( q − 1 ) | L r , i ′ | . The improved strategy used to check if q ∈ T is as follows. For each non-zero value of w, use distinct primitive elements a 1 , a 2 , …, to construct the corresponding sets L r 1 , L r 2 , …, stopping when either the list of primitive elements is exhausted, in which case q ∉ T , or when the union of these sets is L, in which case all non-zero values of u have been covered and so the next non-zero w needs to be tried. When the w values have been exhausted we conclude that q ∈ T . In an actual computer program, sets are usually implemented as arrays of bits, 3 3 Each bit of the array indicates if the corresponding element belongs or does not belong to the set. with unions and intersections being bitwise logical or or logical and operations. In the present case the L r sets have R bits, so using an array of bits to represent them adds a factor of R to the execution time of the program. It turns out that using the inclusion–exclusion principle [6, Chapter XVI] to count the number of elements of a union of sets gives rise to a considerably faster program. For example | L r 1 ∪ L r 2 | = | L r 1 | + | L r 2 | − | L r 1 ∩ L r 2 | , so | L r 1 ∪ L r 2 | can be computed by evaluating | L r 1 | and | L r 2 | using (9.1), and by evaluating the remaining term using | L r 1 ∩ L r 2 | = ∏ i = 1 ω ( q − 1 ) | L r 1 , i ′ ∩ L r 2 , i ′ | . All three computations can be done using only the L r , i ′ sets. As these sets are quite small – for those q, summarily described in Table 1, with q ≥ 371 , 281 that were not tested by the methods of §8 the largest p i is only 89 – they should be implemented as bit arrays. As these bit arrays can be stored in two 64-bit computer words, counting the number of elements of each one of them can be done efficiently using the population count instruction available on modern Intel/AMD 64-bit processors. In general, to count the number of elements in the union of the n sets L r k , k = 1 , … , n , by applying recursively the inclusion–exclusion principle it is necessary to compute 2 n terms. Fortunately, in the present case most of these terms turn out to be zero, because for a small p i the intersection of several L r k , i ′ sets has a good chance to be the empty set. Nonetheless, to avoid an uncontrolled explosion of the number of terms as more values of r are considered, the following strategy was used to accept/reject values of r: • the first 10 non-zero values of r are always accepted; • the remaining non-zero values of r are accepted only if they lead to a 3/4 reduction in the number of residue classes that are still not covered. This fast but aggressive strategy failed in a very small percentage of cases (less than 0.003% for q = 31 , 651 , 621 ). When it failed the same procedure was tried again with the factor 3/4 replaced by 4/5. As this never failed for our list of values of q, even more relaxed parameters (more initial values of r always accepted, larger factors) were not needed. Denote by B r , i ′ the bit array of p i bits corresponding to the set L r , i ′ . In a computer program the set L r k can be efficiently represented by the tuple B r ′ = ( 1 , B r , 1 ′ , … , B r , ω ( q − 1 ) ′ ) , where the initial 1 represents the inclusion–exclusion generation number. Intersections of sets can be represented in the same way, with the generation number reflecting the number of intersections performed. (To apply inclusion–exclusion it is only necessary to keep track of the parity of the number of intersections.) As mentioned before, intersecting two sets amounts to performing bitwise and operations of the corresponding B ⋅ , i ′ bit arrays, which, given the small size of these arrays, can be done very quickly on contemporary processors. In Algorithm 3 the variable B is a list of tuples that represent the non-empty sets used in the inclusion–exclusion formula. The number of residues classes not yet covered by the union of the L r sets, denoted by | B | , is given by | B | = R + ∑ B ′ ∈ B ( − 1 ) generation ( B ′ ) | B ′ | . These considerations give rise to Algorithm 3 (in step 2, the list of primitive elements can be constructed so that a ϕ ( q − 1 ) + 1 − k is the inverse of a k ; that simplifies the computation of the values of r.) Algorithm 3 gave rise to three optimised computer programs, written in the C programming language. One that dealt with q prime and max i ⁡ p i < 64 , another that dealt with q prime and 64 < max i ⁡ p i < 128 , and a third one that dealt with q a prime square and max i ⁡ < 64 . The largest case, q = p = 31 , 651 , 621 , was confirmed to belong to T in one week on a single core of a 4.4 GHz i7-4790K Intel processor. All exceptional values of q not dealt with by the methods of §8 were confirmed to belong to T in about four weeks of computer time (one week of real time, given that the i7-4790K processor has four cores). These computations were double-checked on a separate machine. Fig. 1 presents data for all cases that were tested by the first program. It suggests that the execution time of the program is approximately proportional to q and depends in a non-linear way on ω ( q − 1 ) . The same phenomenon occurs for the other two programs.

In this paper, to address this problem, an ADT based on direct-RF generation is proposed and implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). To achieve this, the pulse encoding is performed after the digital upconversion, which presents challenges in the pulse encoder implementation. However, the proposed design considerably improves the frequency agility when compared with current state-of-The-Art approaches. Two different pulse encoders were designed in this paper, one is based on pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and the other on delta-sigma modulation ( \\mathrm {\\Delta \\Sigma }\\text{M} ). These units are implemented with high parallelization to achieve the required equivalent sampling rates. The proposed design enables the implementation of all-digital RF transmitters in FPGA with a widely tunable carrier frequency. In this paper, a variation from 0.1 up to 6 GHz of carrier frequency, with a maximum frequency resolution of 1.5625 MHz, is demonstrated. Measurement results in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and error-vector magnitude are presented and discussed. In the case of the PWM, maximum SNRs of 39 and 36 dB were obtained for a 5 and 10 MBd of symbol rates (SRs). In the case of \\mathrm {\\Delta \\Sigma }\\text{M} , maximum SNRs of 38 and 35 dB were obtained for 20 and 40 MBd of the SR.",

These tags use a pseudo-random identifier, which is the output of a hash function fed by a fixed secret key that uniquely identifies the tag and by two random challenges that change on each tag activation. The use of random challenges makes it extremely difficult for someone not knowing the secret key of a tag to track its multiple activations. For someone knowing all valid keys, finding out the key that generated a specific tag response requires a time-consuming exhaustive search, if the number of valid keys is large. This can be performed in a very efficient way on a general purpose graphics processing unit. Our simulations show that on a very demanding scenario a single Tesla S1070 system can identify in near real-time the tags generated by 100 single-lane highway RFID readers.",

The empirical data collected during this extensive verification effort, namely, counts and first occurrences of so-called minimal Goldbach partitions with a given smallest prime and of gaps between consecutive primes with a given even gap, are used to test several conjectured formulas related to prime numbers. In particular, the counts of minimal Goldbach partitions and of prime gaps are in excellent accord with the predictions made using the prime k-tuple conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood (with an error that appears to be O(√t log log t), where t is the true value of the quantity being estimated).

In such cases it is possible to increase the system schedulability by dropping some jobs. However, the number and temporal distribution of such drops must be constrained, in order to bound its impact on the system performance. The (m, k)-firm model, which specifies that at least m out of any k consecutive jobs are scheduled, captures such constraints and has been a topic of interest of the scientific community over the last few years. Many advances in the implementation of this type of schedulers were made. However, the (m, k)-firm schedulers hitherto proposed in literature either do not provide deterministic (m, k)-firm guarantees or are not efficiently scheduled. In this paper it is presented a (m, k)-firm scheduler that provides deterministic (m, k)-firm guarantees and is capable of scheduling task sets that are deemed unschedulable by current approaches. The proposed scheduler works by dynamically changing the underlying (m, k)-firm frames. Examples of task sets that are schedulable by the scheduler proposed in this paper but that not schedulable by any other scheduler described in the literature are presented. © 2014 IEEE.",

This paper shows that this method is not optimal and presents a new approach, in which the controller sends a number of predictions of future actuation values, which are outputted when the actuator does not receive a new message. Under this new assumption it is shown that the controller/estimator herein presented performs equal to or better than any previously introduced controller, being the equality verified only in the absence of communication errors. A modified Kalman filter as well as a specific optimal controller for this novel actuation model are also presented. © 2013 IEEE.",

However, in recent years, new variants of control systems have appeared, among them control communication networks with various degrees of reliability. Two approaches have been defined to cope with missing control values in such non-ideal networks: output zero and hold. The optimal control law over output zero lossy networks has already been presented in the literature. In this paper, we present the optimal control law on generalized output schemes. Hence, the control law of derived from such generalized output scheme has more internal structure, being equal to optimal controller of each one of its sub-cases, including the zero and the hold approaches. Furthermore, it is presented the optimal output strategy to which the optimal control under it produces the smallest cost. Two proofs are provided for the proposed control law, one based on the collection/gathering terms and another based on a recursive differential expansion. The novel control law is tested via simulation and the obtained results are in perfect agreement with the presented theory. © 2013 IEEE.",

Consequently, in most such systems, controller changes may cause output oscillations that can compromise the gains achieved by the use of multiple controllers.

In the first, one some a priori information is available regarding the system to be identified; namely, the position of its poles. In this respect, it was argued that the minimization of ρ = maxj|Gb (1/p 0j| is desirable, as it makes the coefficients of the GOBF model to go (asymptotically) to zero as fast as possible (for rational systems). 2. In the second one, a way to estimate the coefficients of the GOBF model is assumed to be available. It was found that the stationarity conditions of a p-norm of the output error, with respect to the pole positions of the GOBF model, only involve the coefficients Kn,n and Kn+1,n+1, of optimal (w.r.t. the coefficients) GOBF models with n and n+1 all-pass sections. In particular, for Laguerre and two-parameter Kautz models with complex conjugate poles these conditions take the simple form Kn,n = 0 and/or Kn+1,n+1 = 0, even when some interpolation constraints that imposed on the model's unit pulse response and/or on its transfer function. So, instead of minimizing the p-norm directly, it is possible to look for solutions of these stationarity conditions. Usually, but not always, the global minimum satisfies the condition Kn+1,n+1 = 0. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.",

Recently, the author was able to extend the available results i) to other || • ||p norms, and ii) to models whose responses to known input signals satisfy, in the time and/or frequency domains, some interpolation constraints. In this paper we combine both extensions. It turns out that the optimality conditions for the poles of Laguerre models constrained as stated above, and using an || • ||p norm, have the same functional form as the already available optimality conditions: the last optimal weight of the model vanishes or the last optimal weight of the model of the next higher order vanishes.",

This model generalizes the Laguerre and \"two-parameter\" Kautz models (which are IIR models with a restricted structure), and has some remarkable properties. Among them is the fact that under ideal conditions the correlation matrix of its internal signals has a block Toeplitz structure. In this paper we explore this property of the correlation matrix, with the result that a lattice version of the aforementioned model is uncovered. This lattice model is then used to determine under which conditions the model's mean-squared-error has a stationary point with respect to the position of its poles, assuming that there is no external feedback between the model's output and input. The results of this study generalize known similar results for Laguerre and \"two-parameter\" Kautz filters. As a by-product of this study the stationarity conditions for the error surface of ARMA(m,m - 1) filters with respect to their pole positions, in an output error configuration and for an arbitrary input signal, are obtained. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This model generalizes the Laguerre and \"two-parameter\" Kautz models (which are IIR models with a restricted structure), and has some remarkable properties. Among them is the fact that under ideal conditions the correlation matrix of its internal signals has a block Toeplitz structure. In this paper we explore this property of the correlation matrix, with the result that a lattice version of the aforementioned model is uncovered. This lattice model is then used to determine under which conditions the model's mean-squared-error has a stationary point with respect to the position of its poles, assuming that there is no external feedback between the model's output and input. The results of this study generalize known similar results for Laguerre and \"two-parameter\" Kautz filters. As a by-product of this study the Stationarity conditions for the error surface of ARMA(m,m 1) filters with respect to their pole positions, in an output error configuration and for an arbitrary input signal, are obtained. :r: 1997 Eisevier Science B.V.

Introduction The approximation of the impulse response of a (linear) system by a truncated orthonormal series is a popular method in many fields of engineering. In electrical engineering this approximation method is particularly useful when each one of the functions (sequences) composing that orthonormal series has a rational Laplace (z) transform, because in that case the system performing the approxima- tion is a finite-dimensional system, which can be realized and used very easily in practice. In this respect, the continuous-time (CT) rational or- thonormal functions introduced by Kautz [23, 24], and the discrete-time (DT) rational orthonormal sequences introduced by Young and Huggins [55], and by Broome [4], are particularly interesting. For the CT case the Laplace transforms of these orthonormal functions can be given by 4>,(s)=A,_i(s) with s + s, ; =0,1,2, (1) S S j s + s, i > 0, (2) and where Re [s;] > 0 for all i. In [24, 45, 33], some specific formulas are given for the special but im- portant case where the sequence {so.Si.s^,... } is composed of pairs of complex conjugate numbers, possibly with some real numbers placed between the complex conjugate pairs. In that case, for each pair of complex conjugate numbers, say s, and s,+i = s*, we can apply a unitary linear trans- formation to <P,(s) and ^;+ i(s), which have complex inverse Laplace transforms, to obtain the functions [24] (there are other ways to do this) ^(s)=A^(s)^-^ S + U,S + V i and 'u, s s + u.s + v, (3a) (3b) which have real inverse Laplace transforms. Here Ui = s, + Si+1 and u, = s,s,+1. Note that (3) remains valid as long as both u; and u, are real and positive, i.e., if s; and 5j+1 are either both real or are a com- plex conjugate pair. The inverse Laplace trans- forms of the functions (P;(s) [or of the functions i(s)] form a complete orthonormal set in L^O, oo) if and only if , ^ Re[s,] ^ K-CLAJ llm L -ii7Ti2 = 00- (4) ^.i-ol +|s,- 1/212 A simple proof of this fact can be found in [5] for the case where the s, are all distinct, and in [11] for the general case. The DT case is similar to the CT case. The z transforms of the relevant rational orthonormal T.

Note that ifzi=0 for all ; then z<P,(z) is just the z transform of the rth sequence of the standard basis of^F^o)- One set of formulas similar to (3) is [55,4] and 1 +z z - z,)(z - z,*) (7a) 11+2,1 z,z - zD (7b) These two functions can replace the functions <P,(z) and <P,+i(z) if z;+i = z*. In fact, it is possible to show that r ^n r^n Ly,.i(z)J ^L^icd' _f>,+i(z) where the unitary matrix Q is given by 1-z.l 11-z, (8) 1 2' l -z, l l -z*l ^, i-^ Q =^ 1+z, l +z, 1+z* i+zd (9) The inverse z transforms of the functions (P,(z) [or of the functions y,(z)] form a complete orthonor- mal set in ^(^O if and only if lim ^ (1 - |z,|) = x. n->x 1=0 (10) A proof of this fact can be found in [52, Section 10.7]. A more detailed account of these two families of rational orthonormal functions, including all rel- evant proofs and an extensive list of references, can be found in [42]. It is quite interesting to observe that the well- known FIR model (the transversal filter) [28, 17] can, in a sense, be considered to be an approxima- tion method based on an orthonormal expansion. In fact, its impulse response is a linear combination of the first sequences of the standard basis of ^(t^o)- Its many computational advantages are, however, shadowed by the large order it requires to approximate systems with long unit pulse re- sponses. This is a consequence of the fact that each sequence of the standard basis of ^(No), which is a delayed pulse sequence, is extremely localized in time. This problem can be considerably amelior- ated for unit pulse responses that decay slowly over time, corresponding, e.g., to systems with a real dominant pole, if the discrete Laguerre functions are used to construct the approximation instead of the delayed pulse sequences. [The discrete Laguerre functions are the inverse z transforms of (5), advanced by one sample, for the case z, = u for all i and for a real u.~\\ This is so because in that case we can adjust the rate of decay of the approxima- tion (i.e., w) to match as best as possible that of the unit pulse response. The resulting so-called Laguerre model inherits many of the properties of the FIR model [50, 39], and is depicted in Fig. 1. However, the discrete Laguerre functions are them- selves not well suited to approximate sequences that have a strong oscillatory behavior, such as, e.g., unit pulse responses of systems with a domi- nant complex conjugate pair of poles. In these situations the discrete 'two-parameter' Kautz func- tions are much more effective, as we can control not only their rate of decay but also their frequency of oscillation [51]. [The discrete 'two-parameter' Kautz functions are the inverse z transforms of (7), advanced by one sample, for the case z-a = z*ii+1 = u for all i and for a complex y.] The three models discussed in the previous para- graph offer different degrees of control of the decay characteristics of their unit pulse responses. The FIR model, that has a multiple pole at z = 0, offers no control at all. The Laguerre model, that has a multiple real pole, offers the control of the decay rate. The 'two-parameter' Kautz model, that has a multiple pair of complex conjugate poles, offers the control of both the decay rate and the frequency of oscillation. These last two models attempt to 236 T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 Fig. 1. The Laguerre model [26] (t is the discrete time variable and q\"1 is the delay operator). This model has a multiple pole at z = u, l u l < l. The transfer function from the input to each of the taps is the z transform of a discrete Laguerre function. For u = 0 the Laguerre filter degenerates into the familiar transversal filter. match closely the internal dominant dynamics of the system being approximated: first-order dynam- ics for the Laguerre model, and second-order dy- namics for the Kautz model. It is then natural to ask if there are 'higher-order' models that are natu- ral generalizations of the Laguerre and Kautz mod- els, and that can match more closely the main dynamical characteristics of the system being ap- proximated (this would give rise to accurate trun- cated series expansions with very few terms). It turns out that the answer is yes, and that each finite-dimensional stable system has associated with it a family of rational orthonormal functions which can be used to represent that system in a very efficient way [18-21]. Not surprisingly, one in- stance of these so-called generalized orthonormal basis functions (GOBFs) can be obtained by setting z, = ZimodBi fo1\" an l' i-by using a periodic se- quence of poles in the functions <P,(z) (or <P,(s) in the CT case). The resulting model, which will be called the GOBF model, is depicted in Fig. 2. Note that the orthonormal functions are used m at a time. In this paper we will consider the approximation of a given system from its input and output signals using a least mean-squared-error (MSE) criterion (in an output error configuration). We will assume that the input signal of both the system and the model is one realization of a wide-sense stationary random process with zero mean and finite variance. We will also assume that we have perfect know- ledge of the autocorrelation function of the input and output signals, and of the cross-correlation function between them. Our main concern will be the determination of the stationarity conditions of the MSE surface of the GOBF model with respect to (w.r.t.) the poles of G(z). It is to be noted that the asymptotic characteristics of the identification of a system by a GOBF model, under far less ideal conditions than those assumed here, namely, finite data records and additive noise corruption of the desired output signal, are given in [49] for a GOBF model with fixed poles. Because there is a well-known equivalence be- tween solving least-(mean-)squares problems in- volving CT signals and systems and those involving DT signals and systems, as explained in [46], we will work exclusively with the DT case. Almost all arguments presented here to study this case can be easily adapted to the other. Also, we will only consider the approximation of single-input single- output stable systems, not necessarily finite dimen- sional, and we will assume, unless stated otherwise, that the input and output signals and the unit pulse response of the system are complex. This last as- sumption will actually make the presentation of the main results of the paper simpler. The real case will be addressed as well, being in its essence equal in form to the complex case. The stationarity conditions for the error curve of CT truncated Laguerre expansions can be found in [6, 25, 53]. The corresponding conditions for the DT case were found much later [31, 32], and were followed by the stationarity conditions for trun- cated 'two-parameter' Kautz expansions [9, 10]. Clearly, these conditions remain valid for Laguerre and 'two-parameter' Kautz models excited by an impulse or by white noise. Curiously, these condi- tions remain valid for a general input signal, as T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 237 X(t) YOW \"W1 Ur^ll W) 7w ^ ^ -ynM Fig. 2. The GOBF model. G(z) is a scalar all-pass transfer function with m poles, all inside the unit circle. Vy(z) is a one-input m-output transfer function, with the same poles as G(z), used to generate the first m GOBFs. (More details about this in Section 3.) Note that the tap signals, Xi(t), are vectors with m elements, and that the weights, , are also vectors with m elements. Note that this model differs from the one in [21] because there is no direct connection between its input and output signals. Special cases of this model are the Laguerre model {m = 1) and the 'two-parameter' Kautz model {m = 2). shown in [38, 41]. In this paper, we generalize these conditions, also for a general input signal, to the GOBF model. As we will see, the known Laguerre and 'two-parameter' Kautz conditions will appear as special but important cases of the more general conditions. One important property of the FIR, Laguerre and 'two-parameter' Kautz models is that the cor- relation matrix of their tap signals has a (block) Toeplitz structure (assuming our ideal conditions, of course). This property is also shared by the GOBF\" model. This (block) Toeplitz structure of the correlation matrix permits the construction of an equivalent lattice structure for these models, in which some of its internal signals are orthogonal to each other. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the notation used in this paper and present some basic results that will be useful in the sequel. Section 3 presents in more detail the GOBFs, and describes briefly the main properties of the model they originate. Section 4 takes advan- tage of the special structure of that model, that makes possible the construction of an equivalent lattice model. This lattice model is in turn used in Section 5 to deduce necessary and sufficient condi- tions for the MSE of one particular GOBF model realization to have a stationary point w.r.t. the position of its poles (one of these stationary points will be the global minimum of the MSE). The main results of this section are then illustrated with an example in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 we sum- marize the contents of this paper and present some concluding remarks. We emphasize that one of the reasons why we work with the lattice model is that for it the stationarity conditions are derived in a particularly elegant way. (In practice, lattice mod- els offer other advantages as well.) In Section 5.3 we translate these conditions to the transversal form of the GOBF model. 2. Notation and preliminaries The discrete time variable will be denoted by the letter t, the square root of 1 by j (not to be confused with j), the advance operator by q, its inverse (the delay operator) by q~1, and the Kronecker delta by o,j. By convection, if i > j then 1;;;,,(.)=() and nL,C)=1- The real part of a complex number z will be denoted by Re[z]. The conjugate of z will be de- noted by z*. Mo will denote the set of the non- negative integers, f^i the set of the strictly positive integers, and /2{S) the Hilbert space of square- summable complex sequences over S, S = N or S = HQ, equipped with the usual inner product. Matrices and vectors will usually be denoted by uppercase and lowercase bold letters, respectively. The identity matrices will be denoted by / and the zero matrices by 0. It will always be possible to infer the dimensions of these matrices from the context they are in. The transpose of a matrix A (or of a vector) will be denoted by A7, its conjugate trans- pose by A^, and the inverse of its conjugate trans- pose by ^-H (assuming that it exists). 238 T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 We will use the standard state space description of a finite-dimensional linear system: rx(t+i)-ipi BJx(t)~} L yw J-Lc DJL^J- (11) We assume throughout the paper that such descrip- tions are minimal, i.e., that the corresponding trans- fer functions do not have pole zero cancellations. In that case it is well know that if the system is stable, if all eigenvalues of A are inside of the unit circle, then the controllability (reachability) Gramian P = ^ (A^B^B} (12) is positive definite and is the unique solution of the Lyapunov equation APA+ BB= P. (13) This Gramian collects in one matrix all inner prod- ucts between the state variables when u(t) = <5(t) (the unit pulse function) and x(0) = 0. In the sequel we will need to use an extension of the usual inner product between two random vari- ables with zero mean and finite variance to stochas- tic vector processes. This extension collects in one matrix all scalar inner products between elements of the first vector and elements of the second vector. In particular, let u(t) and v(t) be two vectors, respec- tively, with m and n elements, whose elements are wide-sense complex stochastic processes with zero mean and finite variance. Then, the 'inner product' between u[t) and v{t) is the complex m x n matrix defined by ^(^^^[^\"(O], (14) where [ ] denotes mathematical expectation. The main properties of this extension of the inner prod- uct are (15a) (15b) for any constant complex matrix^ with m columns, <0, ()>' = <(r), r(t)> + <f), i>'(t)>, (i5c) where a prime denotes differentiation w.r.t. any real variable, and (15d) where G(z) is a rational and stable all-pass transfer function, i.e., its poles are all inside the unit circle and G(z)G*(l/z*) = 1. The following special case of this extension of the inner product will be of considerable importance in the sequel. Let the vectors /(z) and g(z), respectively, with m and n elements, be the transfer functions of two stable and causal discrete-time single-input multiple-output systems. Let u(t) =f(q)x(t) and v(t) = g(q)y(t) be the responses of these two systems when excited by the zero-mean complex wide-sense stationary stochastic processes x(t) and y(t), respec- tively. Let RxyW = E[x{t + T)^*(t)] be the cross- correlation function between x(t) and y(t) and let ^xyCe101) be the (generalized) Fourier transform of Rxy(i:)- Then, the extended inner product between u(t) and v(t) is given by <(), B(O>=- fiev^n^^dw 2J- The extended inner product between two non- random signals r(t) and s(t), which are, respectively, the inverse z-transforms of/(z) and g(z), is simply given by <((), s(t)> = - fCeV^da = </(z),^(z)>. 271 J-n (17) 3. System-based generalized orthonormal basis functions There are two important results behind the con- struction of the GOBFs. The first one is the ob- servation that the states of a minimal balanced realization [36; 16, Chapter 9] of a stable finite- dimensional all-pass transfer function are orthonor- mal to each other when the input signal is a unit pulse and the system starts at rest. This is a simple consequence of the fact that the (non-zero) Hankel Singular values of all-pass systems are all equal to one [13,47,44], which implies that the controllabil- ity Gramian of any balanced realization of these systems is the identity matrix (hence the orthonor- mality of the states). The second one is the observa- tion that the cascade of two (or more) balanced T. OUveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 239 realizations of all-pass transfer functions is also all- pass and balanced [44]. Cascading identical bal- anced realizations of a given all-pass function G(z) gives rise to the GOBFs [21]. The orthonormal functions described in the in- troduction can also be generated by cascading bal- anced realizations of all-pass transfer functions [2,42] : st order all-pass transfer functions for (1) and (5), and second order all-pass transfer functions for (3) and (7). To describe mathematically the GOBFs, let G(z) = D + C(zl - A}~ ^B be a scalar (stable) all- pass transfer function with McMillan degree m and let {A, B, C, D) be one of its balanced realizations (the dimensions of A, B, C and D are, respectively, mxm,mxlxm and 1x1). The transfer function from the input to the m states of this realization is given by f^ D(z} (18) where /(z) = adj(zJ - A)B and D{z) = det(z/ - A}. Note that G(z) = sN(z)/D(z), where N(z) = z'\"u*(l/z*) and | = 1. The elements of/(z) are polynomials of degree smaller than m, D(z) is a polynomial of degree m and N(z) is a polynomial of formal degree m. Cascading n identical realiz- ations of G(z) it is very easy to verify that the transfer functions from the input to the states, par- titioned into n vectors with m elements each, of the balanced realization of G\"(z) are given by [21] N'(z) c,(z) = (z)G'(z) = ^\\f(z), i = 0, The elements of the vectors r,(t) form a complete orthonormal set in ^{N) [19,21] [cf. also (10)]. Therefore, the unit pulse response h(t) of any stable and strictly proper linear system (i.e., with h{t) = 0 for t < 0 and Y.^^\\h(t)\\ < oc, which implies that I^i \\h(t)\\2 < oc) can be expanded in the form (20) where the equality is to be interpreted as conver- gence in the mean. In practice, we are forced to use a truncated version of this expansion, say, with h(t}= ^</i(tU.(t)>i>,(r), n + 1 terms, that gives rise to the model of Fig. 2. Note that if h(0) -^ 0 we can either introduce a con- stant term in (20), as done in [21] (the D term), or we can advance the sequences i',(t) by one sample. In either case the resultant expansion will be able to represent any sequence belonging to ^(f^o)- How- ever, the first approach destroys one interesting and useful property of the model (to be described latter), and the second one makes the state space analysis of the model somewhat more awkward, and makes the transition to the continuous-time case less straightforward. For these reasons, we decided to assume that h{0) = 0 (this assumption was also made in [49]). The almost totality of the results presented in the sequel will also hold if we advance the GOBFs by one sample, allowing our (modified) model to approximate arbitrarily well any impulse response belonging to ^(Ny). If we denote the poles ofG(z) by u,, 1 ^ i ^ m, so that N(z) \", 1 - ufz G(Z}-W)=^^~^ (21) ,n- 1. '(I/P*) m Pi- -U, (19) max1 !Si |G* = max Y[l=Sij=l 1 - U*Pi and those of H(z), the transfer function of a stable strictly proper single-input single-output system with McMillan degree n, by p,, l ^ i ^ n, then it is possible to prove that the asymptotic average rate of decay (to zero) of the t1 norm of the error of the approximation of the unit pulse response of that system by the first mk GOBFs (k -x) is given by [37,19,21] (22) Note that each term of the above product is strictly smaller than one. Note also that the FIR case corresponds to m = 1 and to Ui =O.Ifm=n and if the poles of G(z) are close to the poles ofH(z) we see from the above expression that the convergence of the orthonormal expansion will be very fast. [If the poles of G(z) match exactly those of H{z\\ counting multiplicities, then H(z) can be represented exactly using only the first term of (20).] Even when m < n the above expression usually gives much better decay rates than that of the FIR model. This inter- esting result shows why the GOBFs are useful to approximate finite dimensional linear systems. 240 T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 Let x,(t} = Vo(q}G'(q}x(t) be the signals of the model of Fig. 2. Then, using the results of Section 2, it is easy to show that (,X,{t),Xj(t)) - r G'-^Men^en^endcu, 2\"J-^ (23) where use was made of the fact that G*(l/z*) = G~l(z}. Hence, the correlation matrix of the model's signals is a Hermitian block Toeplitz matrix (see also [49] ), with the block of the ith line and 7th column given by (24) Note that when x(t) is white noise with unit vari- ance (or an unit pulse) then Ri-j = <5;/, which is just the orthonormality property of the GOBFs. Note also that the inclusion of one additional (constant) term in (20), the D term, destroys the block Toeplitz structure of the correlation matrix of the signals of the resultant model, since in that case it will have one additional line and column. The only exception to this observation is the special case m = 1 and G(z)=z-1 (FIR model) for which the Toeplitz structure of the correlation matrix is preserved. On the other hand, advancing the GOBFs by one sample does not destroy this structure. 3.1. A specific parameterization of the GOBFs by the poles of G(z) As we have already mentioned, the functions <P,(z), with the restriction z, = Zimoam for all i, are one particular instance of the GOBFs correspond- ing to a G(z) whose m poles are zy,... ,zi. This corresponds exactly to a realization of G(z) that is the cascade of m first-order all-pass sections. Note that the parameters of the functions ^,(z) are their poles, which is precisely what we want here. With the definitions M,,(Z) = n (i - u\\ k=i ] ,,(z) = n (z - ^)' (25) (26) F,(z)=Ni,,-i(z)yr-kpD,+i,z) (27) and ./z)=[Fl(^)-F,z)]T, (28) it is easy to verify that for this specific parame- terizations N(z) = Ni,z), u(z) = Di,z) and G(z) = N(z)/D(z). Note that (19) then follows from (5). Note that there are m j pole-zero cancelations in the ;th element of v,(z). Note also that the ele- ments of /(z) are polynomials of degree no larger than m 1. For future use note that D^u^) = 0 and that N,/Mk) ^0 for ;' < k < j. In particular, note that Fi(iij) = 0 for; > ;'. The poles of G(z) will be parameterized by their real and imaginary parts: Ui=a.i+]. 3.2. Another parameterization of the GOBFs by the poles of G(z) If G(z) has only real coefficients, or what is the same, if its poles are either real or appear in com- plex conjugate pairs, then it is possible to replace the cascade of two balanced first-order all-pass sections with complex conjugate poles by one bal- anced second-order section with the same poles and whose states are real valued. In other words, in that case it is possible to replace two consecutive orthonormal functions of the form (5) by another two of the form (7). Doing this for each (consecu- tive) pair of complex conjugate poles we arrive at a parameterization for the real GOBFs of the form fAz) = Qrf(z), where &=diag{,...,߄^} (29) (30) is a unitary block diagonal matrix with n, + He blocks in the diagonal. Each one of the n, real poles of G(z) contributes with a 1 x 1 identity matrix to the (block) diagonal of Q,, and each one of the pairs of complex conjugate poles of G(z) contri- butes to a 2 x 2 block similar to (9) to the (block) diagonal O,. Note that m=n, + In^ and that the poles of G(z) are in this case parameterized by only m parameters: n, + to specify their real parts, and Me to specify their imaginary parts. T. Oliveira e Suva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 241 4. The lattice model In this section we will take advantage of the block Toeplitz structure of the correlation matrix of the internal signals of the transversal GOBF model of Fig. 2 to construct a lattice version ofthat model. The main ideas behind this construction are a blend of those used in [54] and those used in [34], which in turn are based on those behind the Levin- son [27] algorithm. The argument used here fol- lows closely the one presented in [12]. Note that the results of this section rely heavily on the proper- ties of the extension of the inner product to vector signals described in Section 2. In order to orthogonalize the signals x,(t) con- sider the problem of the minimization of the vari- ance of the elements of the following two signals: x^t) = ^ Af,jXj(t) with Ai,o=I, J=0 (' ^(0=^5,.,-,^) with Bi.o=I. (31a) (31b) The orthogonality principle of best approximations in Hilbert spaces gives, for these two auxiliary least- mean-squares problems, the following normal equations: (32a) ^(f), x/t)> =0, .;= 0, ..., i - l, (32b) which can also be written in the form ^/(,,A,-,=0, ,/ I,...,;, (33a) (33b) The variance of the elements of x^t) and xb(t) are the diagonal elements of the matrices r?=<Jc;'(r),xI(t)>, r^^t),^)). (34) Note that r\\ > 0 and F;' > 0 if and only if all the signals of the model are linearly independent. It is possible to prove [37, 49] that this is assured if (^^(e11'') > 0 for (almost) all frequencies. When the normal equations are satisfied it is possible to verify that r\\ = ^ A,,R,, n = ^ 5,,,-A-,. (35) fc=0 k=0 Eqs. (33) and (35) can be collected in the following big equation: I Ai., ^,,-1 AU Bi.i Bu-, i I I Ai-,.i ^i-i.i-i 0 0 -i,,-i 5,-i.i I R o R- i R, -, R l R 1 PO R, i R, - i Ri -i Ri 2 R 0 i R i Ki- l R i Ko - r| 0 0 0 -, 0 0 0 r b ri 0 0 A\\- -l .^-i 0 0 rt -l (36) Notice that we have also included in this big equa- tion the equations for the next smaller order (i.e., f 1). Analyzing the special structure of this equa- tion it becomes clear that if the square matrices K^ and K^ satisfy the equation m oi_r^ K^r^ ^1 n rb yb J .<b rb ' ' / L\" / i J L\"' l JL^i-i 'i-iJ then the matrices Ai^ and 5,.^ will be given by \\A \\B, r/ ^nr^-i. \\Kb I _, (38) ,/=0,...,f, with ^i-1., = 0 and 5;-1,1 == 0. Note that this im- plies that K\\= -Jf-^r^i)-1, K^-A^^r1,^)-1, (39) 242 T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 and that r^z-^)^-!, r;' ^{i-K^K^r^ i. (40) Using (38) and Xj+ i(t) = G(g)x/t) in (31) it is pos- sible to verify that the order update formulas for the signals xl(t) and x^t) are (41) with initial conditions x^t) =x}o(t) =Xo(t). These recursion formulas define part of the lattice filter. Besides the above recursion formulas it is useful to have explicit formulas for the 'reflection coeffi- cients' K\\ and K^ that involve only local signals (to these coefficients). In order to do this note that x^t) is orthogonal to Xj(t},j = 1, ...,('. In particular, it is orthogonal to G(q)xb-1 (t). Then, it is easy to verify that K\\ = - (x{,-MG{q}xb-,(t}(^b,,}-l. (42) In a similar manner it is possible to show that Kb=-<.G(q)xb-Mx!^-,{t)>(^f,,,) (43) It is now time to explain why the two auxiliary least-mean-squares problems introduced earlier are useful for our problem. The signal x^t) are impor- tant because they are orthogonal to each other [this can be seen easily from (31b) and (32b)]. In fact, because 5, o = / these signals can be seen to be the result of the block Gram-Schmidt ortho- gonalization algorithm applied to the signals x,(t). The signals xf(r) are also important because they are needed to compute efficiently the signals x^t}, taking advantage of the block Toeplitz structure of the correlation matrix. We will now see how the signals x^t) can be used to compute efficiently the output signal y^(t) of the GOBF model that best approximates, in the least- mean-squares sense, a given desired output signal y{t). Although the signals in x^t) are orthogonal to the signals in x^(t) if j ^- i, usually they are not orthogonal among themselves, i.e., usually F6 is not a diagonal matrix. Because we have assumed that F6 > 0 it is always possible to orthonormalize these signals using a suitable linear transformation. In this way we obtain the signals x^t)=C,xb{t) with <x?(t)?(t)>=/. (44) The elements of the vectors x^(t) will then form an orthonormal set. From (15) it is trivial to verify that the square matrix C, must satisfy the condition ^(^(^c.^nt),^)^\" = c.r^c\" = i. (45) In particular, if the orthonormalization if per- formed using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm with normalization then C, is lower-triangular and is the inverse of the first factor of the Cholesky factor- ization of the Hermitian (positive-definite) matrix n [i4]. Because the signals x(t) are orthonormal it is easy to verify that the best least-mean-squares ap- proximation to y(t} by a linear combination of the signals x^(t) [which, remember, are linear combina- tions of the signals Xi{t)~\\ is given by y0 = E d^xUt}, 1=0 (46) with </, = (,xh(t), y(0>. This formula defines the so- called joint-process part of the lattice filter, which is shown in full in Fig. 3. The (optimal) weights </, of the lattice GOBF model of Fig. 3 are related to the (optimal) weights Wn, i of the transversal GOBF model of Fig. 2 by the formula (47) This formula is a simple result of the equality Vn{t) = E ,(t) = i rf\"x?(t) (48) and of the definition of x^(t). If the input signal is white noise with unit variance then the signals of the transversal GOBF model are already orthonormal, and so x^(t) = x,(t) and </,=' for i=0,...,n. T.

Apart from a delay introduced by Vo(q), for TO = 1 this lattice structure is equivalent to the Laguerre lattice filter [40], which in turn, for MI = 0, becomes exactly the standard FIR lattice structure widely used in signal processing applications [17]. 5. Stationary conditions for the lattice model In this section we undertake the task of deducing the stationarity conditions of the MSE of the lattice verison of the GOBF model w.r.t. the position of its poles. These conditions will be necessary, but not sufficient, for the MSE to have a local minimum (w.r.t. the pole positions). We will consider first the case in which the poles u, of G(z) are arbitrary complex numbers located inside the unit circle, and also in which all signals are complex. The main result concerning this case is stated in Theorem 5.1. Afterwards, we will consider the specific case in which the poles u, are a mixture of real and complex conjugate pairs, i.e., in which G(z) is a rational function with real coefficients, and also in which all signals are real. The main result concerning this case is stated in Theorem 5.2. For a given G(z) the weights rf, of the lattice GOBF model are already optimal w.r.t. the mini- mization of the MSE ofthat model, giving an MSE of (49) Note that <^ dand also most of the signals and matrices used in the previous section are functions of the parameters that define the GOBFs, which in the present case are the poles u,. To avoid cluttering the notation we will not represent explicitly this dependence, and so it will be implicitly assumed. We advise the reader to keep this fact in mind. Let 0 be a real variable, and let a superscript of (0) denote partial differentiation w.r.t. 0 and a superscript of [0] denote that the corresponding variable depends on the 0 chosen. Then e<9) (50) (Since 0 is a real variable this differentiation is allowed.) Because d; = (x^t), y(t}') to proceed fur- ther we need to find the partial derivatives of the signals x^{t) w.r.t. 0, which are given by the follow- ing interesting lemma, whose proof is presented in Appendix A. Lemma 5.1. Assuming that x(t) does not depend on 0, the partial derivative ofx^{t) w.r.t. 0 is given by the three-term formula xr^W = ^ r^(t), J= max;0.i - 1 ; (51) where the m x m complex matrices 7'; j satisfy the formulas r[9],H T1 J -L 7\" \" ft i,j i -j.i ~ v (52) for i ^ 0 and for max {0, i 1} ^ j ^ i + 1. 244 T. Oliveira e Suva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 Applying this lemma to (50) we obtain the fol- lowing important result, also proved in Appen- dix A. Lemma 5.2. The partial derivative of the MSE of the lattice GOBF model of order n w.r.t. 6 is given by E(9) uHf'm J , JH T.[e],H , ^ ,r^ Cn - -(ffB^n.n+i+l + + 1 rn+lin), (53) where the matrix T^n+i is given by (A. 14). From this lemma we conclude easily that if at least one of the conditions rf= 0 and d^+i = 0 is satisfied then the MSE of the lattice GOBF model will have a stationary point, since in these cases ^w will vanish for all choices of 0. But, except for some specific cases that will be identified latter on, these conditions are not necessary, as we are going to show next. To proceed further we need a closed form for the matrix P181'\", that appears via (A. 14) in Lemma 5.2. This closed form is given in the following lemma, whose proof is given in Appendix A. Lemma 5.3. Let [u^, ... ,} be the list of the poles, not necessarily distinct, ofG(z), arranged in an arbi- trary but known order. For each index i between 1 and m, let Ui be the number of times that the value of Ui appears in this list, i.e., Ui = ^'\"^ ^ <5, let v, be the number of times that the value ofu, appears later in this list, i.e., v; = ^\"L.o^u > and let fi and I, be, respectively, the indices of the first and last occur- rence of the value ofui in this list. Also, let a super- script of(v), where v is a non-negative integer, denote v times differentiation w.r.t. z. Then, P16^ is given by pl9}.H ^F^W-l where (54) F=Lfw(u,} -.^(\"J], (55) and where the elements y^i, ^=l,...,m,of^t61 are given by _ D^(u,) ^--N^ (56) and the others are equal to zero. The polynomials N(z) and D(z) are, respectively, the numerator and denominator ofG(z) \\_cf. (21)]. Notice that F does not depend on 6. If the poles of G(z) are distinct then/, = /, = i, Uf= l, v, = 0, and r191 will be a diagonal matrix. This lemma then gives the eigenvalue decomposi- tion ofJ0191'\"; otherwise P191'\" will be defective since r191 will not be diagonalizable. The invariance oF w.r.t. 9 suggests the introduc- tion of the variables / = (C^)\"^, q^^(C^,Fr1^^ (57) in (53), which reduces that equation to the form ^ = (\" + D^r'V.i + ^ir^. (58) Since almost all of the elements of F191 are zero it is easy to verify that this equation can also be put in the form \" r D^'^'^u-} {;\"=2<\"+l),?,Rep;\"-^ (59) where pn^ is the kth element of/, and likewise for qn+i,k- From this equation we conclude easily that Pn.i+i.i = 0 for ; = 1, ... ,m is a sufficient condi- tion for the existence of a stationary point of ^ These conditions include the conditions </= 0 and </+1 =0 mentioned earlier as special cases. The question that now arises is: are these conditions also necessary? This is the question that we will answer in the following two sections for the two specific parameterizations of the GOBFs given in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. 5.1. Stationarity conditions: Complex case So far we have allowed 0 to be an arbitrary real variable. In order to answer the question posed in the previous paragraph for the specific case of sta- tionary points w.r.t. the pole positions of the GOBF model, we will need to use a parameteriz- ation for G(z) and for Vo(z) that involves these poles directly, as this will simplify considerably the analy- sis. One such parameterization was described in Section 3.1. We will assume that the poles of G(z) are complex and that they are independent of each other, and also that all signals are complex. Recall that these poles are given by u, = a, + j. For the parameterization of the GOBFs given in Section 3.1 it is an interesting exercise to verify that T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 245 the matrix F defined in Lemma 5.3 becomes a lower-triangular non-singular matrix, and that if 9 = a, or if 0 = then the only non-zero element of r161 is the one in the !,th line and/i-th column. For these two cases (59) becomes r DW-^-^tu-} ~\\ ^=2(l)Re[p;, ^l'^,[ Q = a, or e = (60) Since ''\"''-1^,) ^2'0\"-1'^,) ^ 0 it is easy to show that the conditions (S;;,\"'' = ^ai) = 0 are equivalent to the condition pn,;,9n+i./, = 0- With this result the proof of the following theorem is trivial (and so it will be omitted). Theorem 5.1. Assume that the poles ofG(z) are com- plex and independent of each other, and that the input and desired signals of the GOBF filter are complex. Assume also thatf{z) is given by (28). Then the conditions (61) are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a sta- tionary point o/^n w.r.t. the poles ofG{z}. In particu- lar, they are satisfied m the global minimum of ^ Remark 5.1. Note that both pn and ^1 depend indirectly on G(z), so the above conditions are actually non-linear equations in the M,'S. Note also that if a given pole is not allowed to change then the corresponding condition should be discarded. Fi- nally, note that if the poles of G(z) are not distinct then some of the conditions are repeated, and the elements oi/ with indices i + I, will be arbitrary, as will be the elements ofyi with indices i ^fi. Remark 5.2. If the matrices C; are lower-triangular (Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization) then it is in- teresting to verify that if the last w i elements of pi, are equal to zero then so will be the last m i elements ofrf and vice versa. This follows from the fact that in this case (C^)\" is a non-singular upper- triangular matrix. It is also interesting to verify that if the first ;' elements of q^ +1 are equal to zero then so will be the first i elements of</i, and vice versa (since Cn+iF is a non-singular lower-triangular matrix). These two observations lead to the con- clusion that if the poles of G(z) are distinct and if - =^1.,=0 (62) for some 0 ^ ; ^ m then the conditions of Theorem 5.1 are satisfied and ^will have a station- ary point. (If some poles are repeated then some of the constraints on the dni's and di j's may be missing.) These special conditions are quite useful, as they occur frequently in practice and involve directly some weights of the lattice filter (see also Remark 5.3). 5.2. Stationary conditions: real case It remains to address the case in which G(z) has real and/or complex conjugate poles, and in which all signals are real. In this case, the parameteriz- ation described in Section 3.2 will play a very im- portant part. Note that for this case N'(z) ^-n^-f^ (63) 1^) with /r(z) given by (29). It is very interesting to verify that for this parameterization of the GOBFs the matrix F defined in Lemma 5.3 becomes a block lower-triangular non-singular matrix with a block structure equal to that of Q, [cf. (30)]. Note that if Ui is a real pole then the i'th column of F will have real elements only, and if {u,, 1(1+1} is a complex conjugate pair then the ;th and (i + l)th columns will be complex conjugates of each other. In the first case we will say that i e I,, i.e., /,. is the set of the indices of the real poles of G(z), and in the second that ; e Ic, i.e., Ic is the set of the indices of the first of a complex conjugate pair of poles of G(z). D(z) will then be given by u(z) = Li E2 - a.] Li [z2 - 2a,z + (a,2 + fl, lei, iel^ (64) where a; is the real part of the poles and -^ 0 the imaginary part of the first of a complex conjugate pair of poles. Equipped with this parameterization for D(z) we are now able to tackle the stationarity conditions of ^with respect to the zeros of D(z) [poles of G(z)]. 246 T\". Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 Consider first that u, is a real pole: M, -= a;, i e Jr. For this case it is easy to verify that (59) takes the form (note that now the relevant elements ofpand of 9+1 are real-valued) r)(ti,),(,-l)/,.\\ ^ = 2(n + l)p,,^^i,^,. (65) Since u\"1'-0''\"1'^;) 7' 0 [cf. (64)] this condition is equivalent to the condition pn.ifln+i.f, = 0- Note that the two coefficients involved in this condition are real-valued. Consider now that {uUn-1} is a complex conju- gate pair: M, = a, + } and M;+ i = a, - j^^, ^ 0, ; 6 7c- For 0 = otj or 0 = /?,, and taking in considera- tion (64), it is easy to verify that there are only two non-zero elements of F191, viz., y^ and 'r'i+i./.+i' ^ich are complex conjugates of each other. It is possible to verify that for these two cases, (59) becomes [n(9),(f,-i)/u.) \"I {\"4(1)R.A,-^^',.4 Q = a, or 0 = ߄ (66) since pn,i,+i = pi, and gi,/.+i =<?;!'+1,/, (note that /.+1 = /, + 1 and./;-+i =/,+!).

Applying (69) and (66) it turns out that the conditions S,^ = ^') 0 are equivalent to the condition pn,i,qn+i.f, 0- Note that the two coefficients involved in this condition are complex- valued. With the results of the previous two paragraphs the proof of the following theorem is trivial (and so it will be omitted). Theorem 5.2. Assume that the poles of G(z} are real and/or form complex conjugate pairs, and that they are independent of each other (keeping in mind that the second pole of a complex conjugate pair is con- strained by the other). Assume also that the input and desired signals of the GO BF filter are real, and that /r(z) is given by (29). Then the conditions Pn.i,<ln+i,f, =0, icicle, (71) are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a sta- tionary point of^n w.r.t. the poles ofG(z). In particu- lar, they are satisfied in the global minimum o/^ It is no coincidence that Theorem 5.2 is so similar to Theorem 5.1. In fact, the results of [3] (see also [48]) can be used to obtain Theorem 5.2 from Theorem 5.1. The observations made in Re- mark 5.1 remain valid for Theorem 5.2. The word- ing of Remark 5.2, however, will need a small change, to account for the block structure of ma- trices and vectors. More specifically, this forces the i used in (62) not to be the index of the first of a complex conjugate pair of poles. Two special cases of Theorem 5.2 are worth of mention: m, = 1 and m^ = 0, and m, = 0 and We = 1. These are the only two cases for which we may write the stationarity conditions in the simpler form </0 and/or rfi=0, m,+m^=l. (72) In all other cases the stationarity conditions are more complex. These two cases correspond, respec- tively, to the Laguerre (lattice) filter [39,40] and to the 'two-parameter' Kautz (lattice) filter. 5.3. Some additional remarks Remark 5.3. For each given set ofw poles there are many possible GOBFs of the forms given in Sec- tions 3.1 and 3.2, one for each valid permutation of T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 247 the poles. Since these permutations do not change the linear space spanned by the GOBFs when they (the GOBFs) are taken m at a time, these permuta- tions leave ^invariant. The stationarity conditions presented in Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 have the same form. Furthermore, in both cases the ;th condition is the stationarity condition of ^w.r.t. the para- meter(s) that specify the ith pole. Suppose that all conditions of Theorem 5.1 (or of Theorem 5.2) are satisfied. In that case let the (possibly empty) set J be the set of indices i for which pi = 0. From our previous considerations it is easy to conclude that for at least one of the possible permutations of the poles the set /is of the form {i + 1, ... ,m l,m} for some 0 ^ i < m. That is, if the poles are distinct then there is always at least one permutation of the poles of the GOBFs for which condition (62) given in Remark 5.2 holds. Remark 5.4. The results of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 can also be translated to a set of conditions that involve the optimal weights of the transversal ver- sion of the GOBF filter. The key to this translation is the simple relation that exists between rfand Vn.n, VIZ., ..H _ JH/ =rf\"C n ^n (73) [cf. (47)]. Using this relation it is easy to verify that the vectors / and q+1 are also given by /=FHM'n.and q^ = F^r^+iH^+i.n+i. (74) Note that in order to compute q^+i it is necessary to compute F^+i and the optimal weights of a transversal GOBF filter of order n + 1. Note also that due to (73), (72) can be rewritten in the form w0 and/or H'i,i=0, m, + m^ = 1, (75) which is in accord with the results presented in [38] (m, = 1) and in [41] (We =1). Remark 5.5. For n = 0 the GOBF filter becomes an ARMA(w, m 1) filter (embedded in an all-pass filter). The problem of approximating a given im- pulse response by the impulse response of this ARMA filter is clearly equivalent to the problem of approximating a given function by a linear combi- nation of exponentials and, if the ARMA filter has multiple poles, exponentials multiplied by poly- nomials of appropriate degrees. (In terms of the approximation problem addressed in this paper this corresponds exactly to the case in which the input signal is white noise with unit variance). The stationarity conditions of the error surface for this specific approximation problem can be found in [1] (see also [22]) for the CT case, and in [35] for the DT case. The conditions given in those papers are in accord with Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, although they do not cover all possible stationary points of the error surface (they assume that all exponentials are present in the approximation; this assumption leaves out many saddle points of the error surface). These special CT results were also presented in a form much closer to the one used in this paper in the interesting article of McDonough and Huggins [29] (see also [30]). In that article it is argued that the global minimum of the error surface (for n = 0, an arbitrary m, distinct poles, and for a white noise input) satisfies the condition di = 0. The restriction that the input signal is white noise can be removed easily. If the unit pulse re- sponse of the system is not the sum of less than m exponentials, and if the last signal ofxo(f) is not used in the approximation then the approximation is necessarily suboptimal, since according to the parameterizations of Section 3 the last pole () is only used in that last signal. Therefore, in the global minimum of Co we must have di. ^ 0 for all pos- sible permutations of the poles of G(z). According to Remark 5.2, that forces di = 0. Unfortunately, the same argument does not hold if n > 0. 6. An example In this section we will study the approximation of a system with transfer function H(z) = ^ k=l z-Pk (76) by some GOBF filters. The five poles of H(z) and their residues are presented in Table 1. With this example we pretend to illustrate the stationarity conditions of the error surface of GOBF filters 248 T.

To simplify (and speed up) consider- ably the numerical experiments we have opted to use a real white noise process with unit variance as our input signal. In this case the lattice structure is not needed because the signals x;(t) are already orthonormal. Furthermore, using Parseval's theorem and the residue theorem, the optimal weights of the filter can be computed easily with the formula d] = <^(z),;c,(z)> = ^ r,G'(l/p,)vl(l/p,). (77) k=l Finally, the MSE of a GOBF filter with n all-pass sections is given by ^ = <H(z), H[z}) - ^ d]d, : T. i,J=l 1 - - Z dJd,. PiPj i=0 (78) The parameterization used for the GOBFs was the one described in Section 3.2, and S,n was minimized using the Fletcher-Powell variable metric method [43] with random initial poles. The number of real poles was set randomly before starting each mini- mization attempt and was not allowed to change. For this reason the algorithm sometimes stopped in a saddle point of ^instead of in a (local or global) minimum. Those situations occurred when a pair of nearly coincident real poles should have been transformed into a pair of complex conjugate poles with small imaginary parts, or vice versa, for <^n to decrease further. Therefore, in all the saddle points we detected at least two real poles were equal. In all forthcoming tables we will present results concerning some minima, and occasionally saddle points, of i^n. In all cases 1000 minimization at- tempts were performed. In those tables ^n will be replaced by J which is the normalized MSE and is defined by J= ^<H(z), H(z)>. We will also pres- ent the weights of the last section of the filter (i.e., dn,i} and the weights of the next section (i.e., rfi,;). Keeping in mind Remark 5.3, we will reorder the poles of each stationary point we have found in such a way that the conditions described in Re- mark 5.2, which involve directly the weights dn,i and ^1,1, are satisfied. Note that if there are repeated poles then not all the conditions are neces- sary (in those cases F1^ is defective). The necessary conditions will be represented by letters after the two sets of weights. The product of two weights with the same letter must be zero. Weights without a letter are unconstrained. We begin with a Laguerre filter (m = 1) and one section (n = 1). As mentioned before, for a Laguerre filter with n sections the stationarity conditions are simply </= 0 and/or rf+1 = 0. It is usually the case that at local minima of <^it is the second one of these two conditions that is satisfied. This example illustrates one case in which it is the first condition that is satisfied, not only on a local minimum of i^ but on the global minimum of^ (This is very rare.) The relevant data for this example is presented in Table 2. Only one minimum was found in the 1000 minimization attempts. We continue with a GOBF filter with two poles (m = 2) and three all-pass sections (n = 3). The rel- evant data for this example is presented in Table 3 (other uninteresting stationary points were found in the search). The first entry shows that repeated poles may produce a (local) minimum; usually, they produce saddle points.

The rel- evant data for this example is presented in Table 4 (other uninteresting stationary points were found in the search). The first entry shows that repeated poles may produce a saddle point.

Note that for this case in the global minimum of ^i not all ele- ments of d-t are zero. 7. Conclusions In this paper we have introduced the GOBF filters to the signal processing community, and we have determined, for a general input signal, the stationary conditions of its error surface w.r.t. the poles of the filter. Since a GOBF filter with zero all-pass sections, i.e., with n = 0, is actually an ARMA(m, m 1) filler, those stationarity condi- tions can be specialized to that kind of filters (cf. Remark 5.5). Among all GOBF filters, only two have very simple stationarity conditions: the GOBF filters with one pole (the Laguerre filters), and the GOBF filters with two complex conjugate poles (the 'two- parameter' Kautz filters). For these two kinds of GOBF filters the stationarity conditions, which were already known, are simply </= 0 and/or dn+i =0 [see also (75)]. Another interesting case occurs for n = 0 (the ARMA filter case). For that case the stationary conditions are simply rfi = 0. This was already known for the special case of a white noise input signal. These special cases are interesting, because their stationarity conditions are very easy to check in practice. The example of Section 6 clearly shows that </+1 =0 may not hold in the global minimum of ^(although it usually does). This has the unfortunate consequence that we cannot always use that appealing condition to search for the global minimum of n- A final point worth of mention is related to the parameterizations of the poles described in Sec- tions 3.1 and 3.2. Those parameterizations are not unique, in the sense that any other permutation of the poles gives a GOBF filter with the same MSE. Also, the number of real poles must be explicitly given, which is cumbersome. There is another para- meterization of the poles, based on the Schur- Cohn stability test, that does not have these prob- lems. More specifically, the normalized ladder structure of Gray and Markel [15] can be used to realize one stage of the GOBF filter, since it is a balanced realization of an all-pass filter. This structure will have stable poles if and only if all its so-called 'reflection coefficients' are smaller than one in modulus. The reason why we have not used this parameterization is that for it the stationarity conditions are more complex. 250 r. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 Acknowledgements I take this opportunity to thank Dr. Ir. A. C. den Brinker for an interesting exchange of correspond- ence concerning the stationarity conditions of the error surface of 'two-parameter' Kautz series. That exchange of correspondence, which included [9], helped considerably to lay the path that led to the results reported in this paper. The properties of the cascade of balanced all- pass sections, reported in Section 3, were brought to my attention by Prof. Bo Wahlberg and by Per Bodin. Appendix A Before presenting the deferred proofs of the lem- mas stated in the main text, we present and prove one additional lemma, which is the fundamental result that lies behind the results of Section 5. Lem- mas A.I and 5.2 where obtained independently by Den Brinker [8] for the special case of a white noise (or impulsive) input signal. Lemma A.1. The partial derivative of r,(t) w.r.t. a real parameter 0 is given by the three-term formula B;.9)(t)=tt()].-l(t)+(\\.(t) (A.I) where both Pm and Q\\ are mxm complex matrices, and where Q\\ is also a skew-Hermitian matrix. Proof. Each element of i>,(z) is a stable strictly proper rational fraction. Hence so will be its partial derivative w.r.t. 0. Then its inverse z-transform will have a finite ^(N) norm, with the result that we can express vf^z) in the form ^(z) = E t^(z). (A.2) -1=0 where U^} = (vf\\z), (z)>. Applying this formula to simplify the result of the differentiation of <i(z), r/z)) = <5,,J/ w.r.t. 0 gives the useful result This implies that t/S8,1 is a skew-Hermitian matrix. On the other hand, we also have ^{z) = iGi-l(z)GW(z)v,(z) + GW^z), which leads to the conclusion that ^i(z) - G{z)vw(z) = G'(z)G<'\"(z)i>o(z) (A.4) (A.5) for ; ^ 0. Using an argument similar to the one used in the previous paragraph we have G^(z)v,{z) = i ^,(z), (A.6) J=0 with V1? = <G(e)(^)l>o(z), r/z Using (A.2) and (A.6) in (A.5) it is easy to verify that [recall that B,+i(z)=G(z)u.(z)] T. t^,^)- I: t/-iz)= E ^/z). J=0 J=l j=i (A.7) This in turn leads to the conclusion that JJW _ JJW , yl . > n ^i+l,; ^i.j-l + '-i' l,J^-'J, provided rl U1^ = vr =0, k < 0. (A.8) (A.9) Replacing i by ; l in (A.8) and applying the re- sulting equation recursively n times, 0 ^ n < i, yields r[9) m ^^=^-,-+\"^1, 0<>i<t. (A.10) Note that we have also replaced j by ; + k. From this equation, (A.3), and (A.9), it is a simple exercise to verify that = iV^ for j = , - 1, (^'o+iT rj=i, -(i+l)^'-\" for j =;!, 0 otherwise, (A. 11) (A.3) which proves the lemma by setting Pw = Vy and by noting that Q^ = U10,} = t/^'o + iV^ is a skew-Hermitian matrix. D Proof of Lemma 5.1. We know that x?(t) = C, E 5.,,-,c,(g)x(t). (A.12) ]=0 T. Oliveira e Silva 1 Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 251 Differentiating this equation w.r.t. 6 (keeping in mind that by assumption x(t) does not depend on 0) and using the results of Lemma A.I it is possible to show that xrw\\t)=''^Tmxo,(t}, (A.13) j=o with (the next formula will be used elsewhere) T^, = - (i + l)^6''\"^1!. (A.14) [The exact values of the other T'^'s are much more complicated. Fortunately, we will not need them. What is really important here is that x^'^^t} is a linear combination of the signals x{t},... ,x?+i(t).] With the definition T^. = 0 for j > i + 1 the upper limit of the summation in (A. 13) can be extended from ; + 1 to oo. An argument similar to the one used in Lemma A.I, but now applied to ^(t^x^t)^ = 0, yields Tm+TmiIi=0, i,j^0. (A. 15) This implies that T^ = 0 for j < i - 1 and the proof is complete. D Proof of Lemma 5.2. Applying Lemma 5.1 to the partial derivative of d, = (x^(t), y(t)') w.r.t. 0 we obtain df^T^^d.^+T^+T^^,, (A.16) where it is tacitly understood that the term involv- ing rf_ i that appears in this formula in the special case i = 0 is to be ignored (T'S8,1-1 = 0).

D Proof of Lemma 5.3. We start by noting that the differentiation of ^-^ w.r.t. 0 is given by (A. 18) r^) =^| D-N^ZWtz) + NiW)^) - (i + {}N(z)Dm(z)f(z) (A.19) and also by (using Lemma A.I) vw)[z} = ^LiP^DW^ + o^zWz).^) -(i+ l}PmN2{^)f{z)~\\. (A.20) Therefore, the two polynomial expressions inside square brackets must be identical. But then we must have N(z) (A.21) where g(z) is a vector with polynomial entries of degree at most 2m 1. (The exact form og(z) is easy to obtain but is irrelevant to the present argu- ment.) Substituting z by u,, i= l,...,m, in the above equation and noting that D{Ui} = 0 and N(Ui) ^ 0 we obtain (A.22) which clearly identifies U^^M^/Nfu,) as an eigen- value of p161-11 and /(M|) as one of its associated eigenvectors. However, if the u.'s are not distinct then we end up with an insufficient number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to fully characterize pie],n '[^s problem may be solved by computing as many derivatives as necessary of (A.21) w.r.t. z and evaluating them at the positions of the mul- tiple poles. For each pole u, of G(z) with multiplicity IAI this method yields ^; equations, of the form nw-Win.} ^'\",) = 7-\"/(\".)' k = 0, ...,/.,- l. N(u, (A.23) This is a consequence of the fact that the first ^1 1 derivatives ofz) w.r.t. z will vanish for z = u,, and 252 T. Oliveira e Silva / Signal Processing 56 (1997) 233-253 that the first ^, 2 derivatives ofD'^z) w.r.t. z will also vanish for z = . The other terms of the deriv- atives of (A.21) w.r.t. z are therefore guaranteed to vanish [(A.23) itself will also vanish if k < /i, 1]. Note that (A.23) includes (A.22) as a particular case (k = 0). Using the definitions of.F and F181 given in the statement of the lemma and of/(z) [cf. (28)], and giving proper attention to the bookkeeping details, it is possible to verify that (A.24) Then the proof will be complete as soon as we show that F is a regular matrix. Since the elements of f(z) are polynomials of degree smaller that m this vector can be expressed by the product/(z) = Lm(z) where the element of the rth line and ;th column of the m x m matrix L is the coefficient ofz7\"1 of the rth element off(z), and where m(z) = [1 (A.25) Note that L must be non-singular. Otherwise at least one of the elements of (z) would be a linear combination of the others, which is impossible since they are orthonormal to each other. Using this representation for/(z) gives F = LM with m (\"m)]. (A.26) Note that At is a (possibly confluent) Vandermonde matrix. This kind of matrices appear frequently in Hermite polynomial interpolation theory and it is well know that they are non-singular [7]. Since the product of two non-singular matrices is again a non-singular matrix the proof of the lemma is complete. D References [1] P.R. Aigrain and E.M.

Paper Stationarity conditions for the L 2 error surface of the generalized orthonormal basis functions lattice filter Tomas Oliveira e^Silva ∗ Departamento de Electronica e Telecomunicações/ INESC-Aveiro, Universidade de Aveiro, 3810 Aveiro, Portugal ∗ Fax: +351 34370545. Recently, a novel model to perform system identification, based on the so-called generalized orthonormal basis functions, appeared in the automatic control literature. This model generalizes the Laguerre and “two-parameter” Kautz models (which are IIR models with a restricted structure), and has some remarkable properties. Among them is the fact that under ideal conditions the correlation matrix of its internal signals has a block Toeplitz structure. In this paper we explore this property of the correlation matrix, with the result that a lattice version of the aforementioned model is uncovered. This lattice model is then used to determine under which conditions the model's mean-squared-error has a stationary point with respect to the position of its poles, assuming that there is no external feedback between the model's output and input. The results of this study generalize known similar results for Laguerre and “two-parameter” Kautz filters. As a by-product of this study the Stationarity conditions for the error surface of ARMA(m, m − 1) filters with respect to their pole positions, in an output error configuration and for an arbitrary input signal, are obtained. Zusammenfassung Kürzlich ist in der regelungstechnischen Literatur ein neuartiges Modell zur Durchführung der Systemidentifikation erschienen. Es beruht auf den sogenannten verallgemeinerten orthonormalen Basisfunktionen. Dieses Modell verallgemeinert die Laguerre- und “Zwei-Parameter”-Kautzmodelle (d.h. rekursive Modelle mit eingeschränkter Struktur) und besitzt einige bemerkenswerte Eigenschaften. Dazu gehört die Tatsache, daβ die Korrelationsmatrix der zugehörigen internen Signale unter idealen Bedingungen eine Block-Toeplitz-Struktur aufweist. In diesem Beitrag nutzen wir diese Eigenschaft der Korrelationsmatrix aus mit dem Ergebnis, daβ eine Latticeversion des erwahnten Modells gefunden wird. Dieses Latticemodell wird dann dazu verwendet, festzustellen, unter welchen Bedingungen der mittlere quadratische Modellfehler einen Fixpunkt bezüglich der Pollagen hat; dabei wird angenommen, daβ keine externe Rückkopplung vom Modellausgang zum Eingang besteht. Die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchung verallgemeinern bekannte, ähnliche Resultate für Laguerre- und “Zwei-Parameter”-Kautzfilter. Als Nebenprodukte der Studie erhält man die Stationaritätsbedingungen für die Fehleroberfläche von ARMA-(m, m − 1)-Filtern bezüglich ihrer Pollagen bei einer bestimmten Ausgangsfehleranordnung und für ein beliebiges Eingangssignal. Résumé Récemment, un nouveau modele d'identification de systèmes, basé sur les fonctions de base orthonormales généralisées, est apparu dans la littérature sur le contrôle automatique. Ce modèle généralise les modèles de Laguerre et de Kautz “à deux paramètres” (qui sent des modèles RII de structure restreinte), et possède des propriétés remarquables. Parmi elles le fait que, moyennant des conditions idéales, la matrice de corrélation de ses signaux internes a une structure Toepliz par blocs. Dans cet article, nous explorons cette propriété de la matrice de corrélation, découvrant par là une version en treillis du modèle décrit plus haul. Ce modèle en treillis est ensuite utilisé pour déterminer les conditions dans lesquelles 1'erreur aux moindres carrés du modéle a un point stationnaire par rapport à la position de ses pôles, en supposant qu'il n'y a pas de feedback exterieur entre la sortie et 1'entrée du modèle. Les résultats de cette étude généralisent des résultats similaires connus pour les filtres de Laguerre et de Kautz à deux paramètres. Accessoirement, on obtient les conditions de stationarité pour la surface d'erreur des filtres ARMA (m, m − 1) par rapport à la position de leurs pôles, dans une configuration d'erreur de sortie et pour un signal d'entrée arbitraire.

The new structure is, like the gamma filter, an IIR filter with restricted feedback whose stability is trivial to check. While the gamma filter decouples the memory depth from the filter order for low pass signals the proposed structure decouples the memory depth and the central frequency from the filter order for band pass signals. The learning equations of the model parameters are presented and shown to introduce an additive 0(p) complexity to the backpropagation algorithm, where p is the filter order. The error surface for a linear filter is investigated on a system identification context and the presence of local minima is confirmed. The performance of the proposed model was found to be better than that of the time-delay neural net [2] on a nonlinear system identification context.",

The only input required to build the model is a segment of sleep stage II signal. The model is then excited by Gaussian white noise to produce the simulated signal. Some comparisons between a real signal and a simulated signal are presented that show that a good matching can be achieved with a low order model.",
