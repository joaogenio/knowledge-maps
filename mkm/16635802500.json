        "doc_abstract": "© 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.Aphasia and other communication disorders affect a person’s daily life, leading to isolation and lack of self-confidence, affecting independence, and hindering the ability to express themselves easily, including asking for help. Even though assistive technology for these disorders already exists, solutions rely mostly on a graphical output and touch, gaze, or brain-activated input modalities, which do not provide all the necessary features to cover all periods of the day (e.g., night-time). In the scope of the AAL APH-ALARM project, we aim at providing communication support to users with speech difficulties (mainly aphasics), while lying in bed. Towards this end, we propose a system based on gesture recognition using a radar deployed, for example, in a wall of the bedroom. A first prototype was implemented and used to evaluate gesture recognition, relying on radar data and transfer learning. The initial results are encouraging, indicating that using a radar can be a viable option to enhance the communication of people with speech difficulties, in the in-bed scenario.",

In the scope of the AAL APH-ALARM project, our main aim is to extend communication support for users with speech and language difficulties (mainly aphasics) in the bedroom environment. We propose a system for supporting communication based on gesture recognition using non-invasive compact sensors worn by the user or deployed in the environment (e.g., bed).

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Smoke inhalation poses a serious health threat to firefighters (FFs), with potential effects including respiratory and cardiac disorders. In this work, environmental and physiological data were collected from FFs, during experimental fires performed in 2015 and 2019. Extending a previous work, which allowed us to conclude that changes in heart rate (HR) were associated with alterations in the inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO), we performed a HR analysis according to different levels of CO exposure during firefighting based on data collected from three FFs. Based on HR collected and on CO occupational exposure standards (OES), we propose a classifier to identify CO exposure levels through the HR measured values. An ensemble of 100 bagged classification trees was used and the classification of CO levels obtained an overall accuracy of 91.9%. The classification can be performed in real-time and can be embedded in a decision fire-fighting support system. This classification of FF’ exposure to critical CO levels, through minimally-invasive monitored HR, opens the possibility to identify hazardous situations, preventing and avoiding possible severe problems in FF’ health due to inhaled pollutants. The obtained results also show the importance of future studies on the relevance and influence of the exposure and inhalation of pollutants on the FF’ health, especially in what refers to hazardous levels of toxic air pollutants.",

In this context, we investigated the possibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a model(s) that can be used to support the detection of the Val30Met mutation (possibility of developing the disease), as well as symptom onset detection for the disease, given the gait characteristics of a person. These characteristics correspond to 24 gait parameters computed from 3-D body data, provided by a Kinect v2 camera, acquired from a person while walking towards the camera. To build the model(s), different ML algorithms were explored: k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and multilayer perceptron. For a dataset corresponding to 66 subjects (25 healthy controls, 14 asymptomatic mutation carriers, and 27 patients) and several gait cycles per subject, we were able to obtain a model that distinguishes between controls and vATTR-V30M mutation carriers (with or without symptoms) with a mean accuracy of 92% (SVM). We also obtained a model that distinguishes between asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers with a mean accuracy of 98% (SVM). These results are very relevant, since this is the first study that proposes a ML approach to support vATTR-V30M patient assessment based on gait, being a promising foundation for the development of a computer-aided diagnosis tool to help clinicians in the identification and follow-up of this disease. Furthermore, the proposed method may also be used for other neuropathies.",

Introduction and objectives In recent years, the World has witnessed a rapid population growth and, consequently, the emergence of large urban centres that changed the paradigm of mobility an transportation. In 2017, the demand of this sector was responsible for 31% of the European Community countries' energy final consumption (Eurostat, 2018), where passengers' private cars hold 83,3% of the total share (Eur stat, 2019). The high a d increasing request of the transportation' sector had * Corresponding author.

More recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent measures of social distancing, this global reality has witnessed an unprecedented alteration through reductions of traffic volume and congestion, road accidents and air pollution (De Vos, 2020). Although it is not expected an increase of the kilometres travelled by car when compared to the pre-pandemic period, the public transportation share will significantly drop since people feel fear of infection and will choose private transportation, if possible (De Vos, 2020). Therefore, one of the possible measures to counteract, simultaneously, the transportation sector trend and the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on human health â€“ especially in urban centres â€“ is to promote active modes that are more efficient, cheaper, less noisy and, as a result, more sustainable than the day-to-day car commute. This is the case of the bicycle. Lately, with the improvement of technology and, hence, the possibility of providing data on new variables related to bikeability â€“ such as available routes, existing infrastructures and associated safety issues â€“, intelligent cycling information systems started to emerge. These tools revealed to be ultimately essential to enhance the use of bicycles, either through its ability to assist a cyclist in the route choice process effectively, support systems at the policy level or improve attractive bike-sharing systems (Cruz et al., 2020). In this context, the main objective of this paper is to develop a specific information system for cycling navigation, based on a geographic information system (GIS) and using seven different indicators: travel time, energy expenditure, effort distribution, infrastructure performance, safety, comfort and emission hotspots. The case study was the Portuguese city of Aveiro. 2. Literature review The route choice for private car drivers is conventionally modelled having in view the minimization of time and operation costs of the vehicle. However, in the case of the cyclist, the scenario is different since time is not necessarily the cyclist's main priority (Ehrgott et al., 2012). In this context, the term bikeability appears to describe the friendliness of a given road environment towards the cycling, often with the underlying objective of collecting reference values from certain areas for later comparisons and extracting conclusions. Tendentially, bikeability is materialized through an index that allows a mathematical weighting between physical, personal, psychological and social factors to make different cycling routes and paths comparable (Krenn et al., 2015). Therefore, although travel time is the most important factor for commuting cyclists, it is possible to find other equally relevant cycling indicators in the literature: energy expenditure, for instance, measured indirectly from the road gradient (Ehrgott et al., 2012) or directly through human heart rate (Cruz et al., 2020); safety and comfort, whether by accident reports involving cyclists (Singleton & Lewis, 2011), passing distances in car overtaking maneuvers (Bahmankhah et al., 2020) or road surface resistance (HÃ¶lzel et al., 2012); cycling infrastructure properties, through a set of metrics termed bicycle level of service (BLOS) (Pritchard et al., 2019) or pollution concentrations (Minet et al., 2018). Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of the functionalities of some of the most relevant bicycle route planners available on the market. As can be seen, despite all the scientific progress made in expanding the knowledge about cycling indicators, the same has not yet been sufficiently applied in the development of collaborative platforms to simultaneously support cycling navigation and the planning and management of cycling networks (Cruz et al., 2020). Furthermore, these routing tools appear to be more concentrated in cities where there is already a substantial diffusion of the bicycle culture (Paul et al., 2016). Thus, cities that still seek to strengthen this active mode have only access to the most generic tools available â€“ e.g. Google Maps or ViaMichelin, more focused on road traffic and, therefore, with their cycling features appearing as a kind of extension to the original platform. Besides, the modelling process of the cycling data based' route planners is rarely mentioned in the literature (Cruz et al., 2020). Therefore, this paper presents a starting design for a cycling navigation service by developing an open information system focused on a multi-dimensional data structure analysis, capable of supporting cyclists in the route decision process and local authorities in simultaneously understanding and improving their cycling networks, and based on seven cycling indicators established over a set of methodologies found in the literature. The urban area of the Portuguese city of Aveiro serves as the baseline scenario for the implementation of this tool. From a scientific point of view, the emission hotspot indicator presents itself as a novelty in the field, enabling the system with an environmental factor capable of attracting potential new users.

Comparative analysis of some of the most relevant bicycle route planners available on the market. 3. Methodology Figure 1 summarizes the four main stages of the paper methodology. Foremost, it was necessary to choose the study area for the application of the information system and select the final attributes and respective methodologies of each defined indicator. Thus, a data collection process was carried out through empirical monitoring and on historical data assessment. Then, a map data analysis was performed on a GIS platform. Finally, routes were optimized in several case studies according to multicriteria analysis (based on different attributes). 3.1. Experimental design The study area chosen to implement this methodology was the city of Aveiro, Portugal. The final map used captures a heterogeneous portion of the local cycling network, both at road types â€“ including multiple cycle paths, residential, collector and arterial roads â€“ and points of interest â€“ the central station, an hospital, two leisure grounds, two high schools and several shopping centres. Lastly, these changes were attached to ArcGIS, resulting in a 449-link graph. Figure 1. Methodology overview. 110 Francisco LÃ© de Matos et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 52 (2021) 107â€“114 4 LÃ© de Matos et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2020) 000â€“000 The final indicators' attributes and its formulations were defined in terms of required inputs and data processing according to the information contained in table 2. Overall, the attributes of the travel time, safety and comfort indicators were obtained more directly, while those of energy expenditure, effort distribution, infrastructure performance and emission hotspots were calculated indirectly through more detailed mathematical methods. Indeed, concerning the group of energy indicators, the energy expenditure seeks to quantify the number of calories required by each link, using, for this purpose, the function developed by Mendes et al. (2014) that relates the energy expenditure with the instantaneous human heart rate (HR) variation. The effort distribution pursues to assist less experienced cyclists and avoid steep slopes, even if the resulting route implies a longer travel time. For this purpose, the Bicycle Specific Power methodology is used, a concept also developed by Mendes et al. (2014) for quantifying instant specific energy of the bicycle-cyclist system through speed, acceleration and road slope angle, grouping it in 10 different modes that cover the full range of the bicycle operation. In the context of route optimization, where the aim is to minimize costs, the selected attribute was the number of high BSP modes (>4), which allows to identify the links whose specific power and consequent effort required is high. Regarding the infrastructure performance indicator, which intends to select routes composed of the best available cycling facilities, the segment BLOS methodology proposed in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, 2010) was chosen. Through variables related to the traffic, space and pavement conditions of the road, it is possible to classify each link with a BLOS qualitative score that goes, in descending order of quality, from A to E. For a route based on the best infrastructure, the link length is a relevant variable. E.g., a long link with a better score may not be preferable to a shorter link with a slightly worse score. Thus, converting, in the same order, the qualitive score into numbers from 1 to 5, the final attribute of this indicator was defined as the product of the BLOS numeric score by the link length. Lastly, the emission hotspots indicator seeks to quantify NOx emissions in each link, a pollutant with harmful effects on human health. The selected methodology is detailed in Macedo et al. (2020) and estimates the NOx emissions per kilometre of representative diesel and gasoline vehicle according to driving speed. By using the input data presented on table 2, the final attribute of this indicator was established as the total emissions of each link (for an equally divided scenario of diesel and gasoline vehicles, according to the current statistics of the Portuguese car fleet (Emisia SA, 2019)). Table 2. Summary table of the chosen indicators and respective attributes, methodologies and input data. Francisco LÃ© de Matos et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 52 (2021) 107â€“114 111 LÃ© de Matos et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2020) 000â€“000 5 3.2. Data collection To carry out the data collection process, a conventional aluminum bicycle (with a mass of 18 kg) was instrumented with three different devices: a GNSS data logger (Qstarz BT-Q1000XT), in order to record the dynamic profile (time, geographic coordinates, altitude and speed) of the campaign trips; a Bluetooth wireless device named Vital-JacketÂ®, able to continuously register high quality clinical ECG from which is possible to remove the cyclist's HR during each instant of travel (Cunha et al., 2012); and a video camera (Braun 4K Champion Action Cam), selected to enroll the overtaking maneuvers and parked vehicles in each link. All the devices, of negligible weight, were synchronized and recorded data with a resolution of 1 Hz. Due to the need to cover all the map segments during the experimental campaigns, and given that the system has to be able to trace a route between any OD pair on the map, each link was classified according to its importance in the network in order to define a minimum number of samples: for each direction of the segment, a primary link was traversed at least three times, a secondary link twice and tertiary link only once. Hence, seven experimental campaigns were carried out by a single cyclist, in weekdays, during the afternoon peak hours (5:30 pm to 7:30 pm) and under similar dry weather and temperature conditions. Altogether, about 120 km were covered, resulting in 94,226 useful data points on second by second dynamic profile and HR, as well as about 8 hours of video. In addition to the empirical monitoring, previous data was assessed to complement the gathered data and, thus, achieve the final attributes: previous detailed information about traffic volumes and average car speeds were clustered (Sampaio et al., 2019) and a 5-year (2012 to 2017) history of crashes involving cyclists (ANSR, 2018) was analyzed to reach the safety indicator' final attributes. Concerning the chosen BLOS methodology for the infrastructure performance indicator, a plant of the city was examined to assemble the network roads' widths and parking lengths and the local city bus schedules were consulted to determine the heavy vehicle volume percentages (based on the valid simplified consideration that the heavy traffic of the chosen sub-area is mainly composed by public transportation). 3.3. Data analysis, map-matching and route optimization Once the empirical process was completed, the gathered data was analyzed to reach the final attributes. Video camera analysis allowed the determination of the average number of car overtakes and part of the input data that, along with the data collected by consulting the municipal plant and the city bus schedules, provided the length- weighted infrastructure BLOS. With the aid of GPS Visualizer online tool, the GNSS and Vital-JacketÂ® recorded data was processed to reach the average values of travel time, energy expenditure and BSP modal distribution per link.This last procedure also allowed the acquisition and localization of the number of registered collisions and, together with the previously calculated travel time, the emissions of NOx per link. Subsequently, the obtained attributes were manually matched to their respective links in the ArcGIS graph. The seven final attributes fields and link lengths were individually defined as a user-specified cost attribute, resulting in eight different impedances that can be used as optimal route selection criteria. This process was carried out using the Network Analyst and the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any OD pair. Thus, for a given OD pair, the information system can determine eight different routes: the shortest, the fastest, the most efficient, the softer, the safest, the most comfortable, with the best infrastructure and with fewer emissions. 3.4. Case studies After having achieved a functional information system for cycling navigation, the next phase focused on assessing the performance of the platform through three case studies: as shown in figure 2, the first considers the South-North extent of the map, the second evaluates the longitudinal extent and the third has three locations instead of only two. For each case, the applied procedure was based on the creation of an optimal route, registration of its eight accumulated attributes and repetition of the same steps for each impedance. Subsequently, to access the individual behaviour of the established indicators, a relative comparison was made between the accumulated attributes of each 112 Francisco LÃ© de Matos et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 52 (2021) 107â€“114 6 LÃ© de Matos et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2020) 000â€“000 route and the best (i.e. the lowest) accumulated attributes obtained for each indicator. 4. Results Figure 2. Locations of the three considered case studies. Table 3. Table of relative relationships between each indicator and each type of route for all three case studies. Figure 3. Spider charts of tradeoffs illustration between routes and indicators for all three case studies. Francisco LÃ© de Matos et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 52 (2021) 107â€“114 113 LÃ© de Matos et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2020) 000â€“000 7 Two analysis tools were built: a table of relative relationships (table 3) showing, for each optimization indicator (columns), how the remaining factors (rows) are negatively affected concerning their individual best performance, and three spider charts (figure 3), which allow the visualization of the previous table's tradeoffs by scoring the indicators on a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 corresponds to the best accumulated attribute recorded. The first aspect that stands out is the similarities between the routes drawn by the impedances of the distance, travel time and energy expenditure (calories) indicators. The shortest and the fastest route are the same in two case studies but diverge in one, which demonstrates the relevance of an indicator exclusively dedicated to travel time as it does not linearly accompany the increase in length. This effect is related to circulation phenomena such as waiting times at traffic lights, intersections and queues, thus achieving a more realistic characterization of the network. The energy expenditure is dependent on travel time rather than effort distribution. Thus, since it does not have exclusive behaviour, it makes more sense to use the final attributes of this indicator in an informative context for any route drawn by the system than to use it as an optimization criterion. All the other indicators suggest individually relevant and appropriate routes, except for safety: when trying to avoid the links with the lowest number of registered accidents, the traced path ends up presenting the worst results in the remaining indicators. This phenomenon is a contradiction of what the indicator seeks to preserve, as it subjects the cyclist to disproportionately greater potential risk by travelling over a longer period and greater distances. Regarding the type of privileged routes, three groups of indicators with different behaviours were identified: distance, travel time and energy expenditure optimum routes tend to select mostly collector and arterial roads, comfort and emissions optimized routes are mainly composed of residential streets and, finally, routes with the lowest effort distribution, best infrastructure and safety performance tend to make a balanced use of the three types. This distribution is caused by the motorized traffic volume that defines each link and it demonstrates the studied data sample, although limited, is sufficient to make a realistic characterization of the system's cycling network. This phenomenon opens the door to the possibility of developing a cycling navigation service based on the created system, but improved through a larger data sample, carried out by a more heterogeneous group of volunteer cyclists. Effectively, from the built and validated impedances, this service can directly assist the bicycle user through a customizable interface, where, like the studied route planners, a user preference system, capable of selecting the most appropriate route from certain input data, is integrated. Also, the combination of the users' route history with the already identified tradeoffs between indicators (e.g., as illustrated in the spider charts in figure 4), allows infrastructure planners to identify critical aspects in the city network and act to promote the bicycle between heterogeneous cyclist profiles. 5. Conclusions The central focus of this paper was the creation and development of an information system for cycling navigation, based on urban area, built on a GIS and using seven different bike ability indicators: travel time, energy expenditure, effort distribution, infrastructure performance, safety, comfort and emission hotspots. Once the objective was completed through the aid of a conventional instrumented bicycle and available data from local reports, the result was evaluated using three different case studies, from which the following major conclusions were drawn: â€¢ Although often coincident, the fastest route was 2% longer than the shortest route in case study 3, demonstrating the inclusion that time travel indicator makes of waiting times, intrinsic to the road network. In its turn, energy expenditure was always equal to travel time, thus proving to be more useful as additional information of the traced routes by the system rather than an impedance. â€¢ Except for safety, all indicators gave origin to unique and balanced routes. In fact, compared to the best values, the safest route was, at least, 50% longer and more time consuming, with several overtaking maneuvers (400% higher) and a 350% worse BLOS score. Therefore, the attribute of this indicator must be improved or changed. â€¢ The achieved attributes conveniently characterize the studied road network, adapting to the links according to their traffic volume: more time preserving indicators will make priority use of arterial and collector roads, while comfort-related indicators will mainly choose residential streets. Overall, this work represents a successful first step in the development of a cycle navigation service, which is expected to have a larger and heterogeneous dataset in order to improve the cyclist decision-making process, the urban planning and, consequently, the modal share of the bicycle in urban environments. Thus, with this future goal in mind, 114 Francisco LÃ© de Matos et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 52 (2021) 107â€“1148 LÃ© de Matos et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2020) 000â€“000 all the collected data and ArcGIS graph of this research is available online, in the open access repertoire Zenodo (LÃ© de Matos et al., 2020).

This condition entails a definitive and progressive motor impairment that compromises walking ability from near onset. The detection of the latter is key for the disease's diagnosis. The aim of this work is to perform quantitative 3-D gait analysis in ATTRv V30M patients, at different disease stages, and explore the potential of the obtained gait information for supporting early diagnosis and/or stage distinction during follow-up. Sixty-six subjects (25 healthy controls, 14 asymptomatic ATTRv V30M carriers, and 27 symptomatic patients) were included in this case-control study. All subjects were asked to walk back and forth for 2 min, in front of a Kinect v2 camera prepared for body motion tracking. We then used our own software to extract gait-related parameters from the camera's 3-D body data. For each parameter, the main subject groups and symptomatic patient subgroups were statistically compared. Most of the explored gait parameters can potentially be used to distinguish between the considered group pairs. Despite of statistically significant differences being found, most of them were undetected to the naked eye. Our Kinect camera-based system is easy to use in clinical settings and provides quantitative gait information that can be useful for supporting clinical assessment during ATTRv V30M onset detection and follow-up, as well as developing more objective and fine-grained rating scales to further support the clinical decisions.",

Introduction The transportation sector faces increasingly demanding energy consumption and emissions standards representing 33,2% of the final energy consumption, with the road transportation sector being responsible in 2017 for 82% of that energy consumption (EIA, 2017). An alternative to reduce the impact of the transportation sector, especially regarding urban environment, is to reduce the demand for energy intensive modes of transportation and to promote alternatives that provide a less noisy, cheaper and more sustainable alternative than a day-to-day car commute. New information technologies and providing information on new variables related with road cycling can be an important tool for enhancing the use of bicycles, either through support systems at the policy level, or through the improvement and creation of bicycle sharing systems that effectively are attractive to citizens. 2. Literature review â€“ current cycling navigation platforms It is commonly acknowledged that cyclists select their route differently to drivers of private vehicles. Commuter cyclists have multiple criteria when choosing their route: the travel time and the suitability of a route including safety, traffic volumes, traffic speeds, presence of bicycle lanes, whether the terrain is flat or hilly (Ehrgott, Wang, Raith, & Van Houtte, 2012). Thus, bicycle route planners have emerged as a kind of extension of route planners for cars, although not always presenting the best solutions. In fact, the most interesting results obtained though bike route planners are based on more specific algorithms for the bicycle, but they are only incorporated in some cities where the use of this mode of transportation is more frequent. Although there are a number of bicycle route planning tools available, the modelling and way in which bicycle users choose their routes is rarely mentioned in the literature. Table 1.

In fact, route generators for bicycle users differ widely from the conventional route planners, since they integrate other variables when calculating tips costs for cyclists. Table 1 shows a comparative analysis of some the most important existing bike route planners. Although cycling navigation tools address a broad set of criteria, the authors did not identify collaborative tools focused on a multi-dimensional data structure analysis to support the decision making of cyclists and management authorities. Regarding the decision making process, Pritchard (2018) has identified seven families of methods for studying Bicycle Route Choiceâ€”Such methods include GPS devices, smartphone applications, crowdsourcing, participant- recalled routes, accompanied journeys, egocentric cameras and virtual reality. Other works have focused on estimating the cyclist real physiological impacts (Duarte, Mendes, & Baptista, 2014) and developing a methodology to assess real-world operation patterns based on bicycle power (driving power distribution), Mendes, Duarte, & Baptista, 2015). Detailed information on route characteristics is not only useful to support cyclists in the route decision process, it also provides very relevant information for the level of planning and promote this transport mode. Demand is influenced by distinct sets of factors: the conventional bike share choice is most sensitive to measures of effort and comfort while the e-bike share choice is more sensitive to user heterogeneities (Campbell, Cherry, Ryerson, & Yang, 2016). While most of the studies focused on an analysis route choice behavior using different methods, to date the authors are not aware of applied research in the development of a collaborative platform to support cycling navigation based on important criteria (comfort, effort physical, travel time) and simultaneously constituting a tool to support the management and planning of cycling infrastructure. 3. Concept and Methodology The main concept of the proposed approach can be seen in figure 1. The main purpose of this work is to assess in which extent the information generated in this study (Bicycle specific power, Energy expenditure, Safety and comfort and Travel time) may be relevant and effective for further integration into a collaborative sensing platform to be used both from and individual and management point of view. The methodology used to monitor the impact of the route choice was based on four main steps. i) empirical monitoring, ii) data analysis, iii) analysis of results and, iv) systemization of information for final users. 3.1. Empirical monitoring 3.1.1. Prototype description A conventional equipped aluminum bicycle (18 kg) was used to record three data sets: a video camera to record the traffic density and car overtakingâ€™s , an equipment for recording cyclistâ€™s heart rate called â€œVital jacketâ€� (Cunha et al., 2010) and a GNSS data logger data to record the dynamic profile of the trip (including location, altitude and speed). The Vital Jacket is intended to be a \"heart wave monitor\". This equipment can send clinical quality ECG and heart rate data through Bluetooth wireless connection. At the same time, all data is collected into an SD memory card that can be used for offline analysis (Cunha et al., 2010). Fig. 1. Concept of the proposed approach to provide information to managing authorities and cyclists 78 Ricardo Cruz et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 47 (2020) 75â€“824 Cruz et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2019) 000â€“000 A video camera (Denver ACT-1015 MSD) was used to register and describe the traffic density on selected routes. All equipment have been synchronized and recorded data with 1 Hz resolution. The weight associated to the equipment is negligible and can be easily carried by a cyclist, as shown in Figure 2. Road experiments were performed during weekdays in similar periods of the day under dry weather conditions and temperature ranging between 18 and 22 CÂº. 3.1.2. Study routes 12 routes connecting 6 origin-destination pairs were covered. In total 176 km of road experiments have allowed to gather about 13 hours of video equivalent to 48,240 data points on second by second heart rate (HR), bike position speed, acceleration, and road grade (see table 2). 3.2. Data processing 3.2.1. Specific Power and Energy expenditure Bicycle Specific Power methodology, a concept developed by Mendes, Duarte, & Baptiste, 2015 was employed to estimate energy consumption rates based on real world on-road data, according to eq.(1) 31[ (1 ) ( ) ] 2 ï�¥ ï�± ï�²ï‚´ ï‚´ ï‚´ ï‚´ ï‚´ ï‚´ ï‚´ ï‚´ï€½ ï€« ï€« ï€« ï€«i R a DBSP v a g sen C A m g C v (1) Fig. 2.

An important step was to analyze the human energy expenditure (EE) associated to each BSP mode. i.e. the energy spent by the cyclist to drive the bicycle during each second. HR can be a useful explanatory variable to generate an accurate approximation of the energy consumed by human body during physical activity. Mendes et al (2014) developed an average equation based on three different models relating HR and Energy Expenditure (EE). This equation was used for the purpose of this study. For the purpose of demonstrating the methodology, the data of all cyclists were integrated into a single data set. However, further data from different demographic groups should be considered for achieving representative sample of the population. Empirical row data were filtered to remove outliers and errors from HR and GNSS data (e.g acceleration higher than 1m/s2). 6 2(9 10 ) 0.006 0.0449ï€­ï€½ ï‚´ ï‚´ ï€« ï‚´ ï€­EE HR HR (3) 3.2.2. Safety and comfort data To further support the decision-making process, other variables such as the traffic density (e.g. number of overtaking maneuvers by cars) were also considered. After the field work, the number of cars passed in the same direction along each route was estimated by video analysis in the laboratory. A low-cost distance sensor for counting and determine overtaking distance is being improved to automate this process. Fig. 3.

All road accidents involving cyclists that results any level of injury (light and severe injuries) or fatalities were taken into consideration. However, the reported results revealed that all the crashes occurred in the analyzed routes refer to light injuries. 4. Results In a first phase, the results of the empirical monitoring of the routes are demonstrated. Subsequently, it is discussed how information can be disseminated to cyclists and used by management authorities. 4.1. Energy expenditure and BSP mode Figure 3 demonstrates cumulative energy expenditure per BSP mode for the whole route and also normalized by distance. Despite all routes in the hilly City of Porto are shorter than in Aveiro, the average total energy expenditure per trip is considerable higher (170%). One may also see that the contribution of higher BSP modes for total energy expenditure is considerably higher in the hilly city routes. In terms of route comparison for the same OD pairs, figure 3a shows that is possible to save approximately 30% energy by choosing an appropriate route in the city of Aveiro and in the city of Porto. Figure 4 exemplifies the relevance of altitude change in terms of relative speed reduction and HR increase by crossing or a 180 meter ascending section. Table 4 summarizes a set of important indicators for cyclists which were estimated based on the monitoring prototype and historical data. In addition to energy expenditure previously described, the 5-year accident history (ANSR 2018), the number of car overtakingâ€™s (from video sensors), the number of seconds spent on the higher VSP modes (3, 4, 5) (corresponding to situations of intense physical effort), travel time and distance are provided. Due to limited space, results are presented only for AB (flat) and CD (hilly) OD pairs. The number of registered accidents with cyclists in both OD pairs is relatively low in both cities. A plausible explanation is the very low bicycling modal share in both cities Aveiro (2.7% (Way2go, 2012)) and Oporto (0,4% (INE, 2017)). Even considering the limited range of data, we can observe that the number of overtaking maneuvers by cars is not directly related to the number of accidents. Table 4. Route data features gathered from road monitoring and historical accident data (2013-2017).

Relative variation of HR and Speed over time during an ascending section with 180 m length. Ricardo Cruz et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 47 (2020) 75â€“82 81 Cruz et al./ Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 Therefore, we will consider this variable (overtaking) as a comfort indicator bearing in mind that drivers and cyclists perceive the road-sharing experience as life-threatening and experience anxiety, anger, and fear (Kaplan & Prato, 2016). A higher number of overtaking maneuvers can be also seen as an indicator of traffic volume and consequent pollution (Bahmankhah & Coelho, 2017). From table 4, one can observe the routes that have a greater energy expenditure (approximately 28% higher) in both cities compared to the routes where there is lower energy consumption), are also those routes where a smaller number of car bicycle overtaking is observed. 4.2. Exploiting information to support route choice and infrastructure planning In a traditional 4 step transport model, after the modal split the travelers decide which route is the one that minimize their cost. For a cyclist, the most relevant information may not be an absolute value as a single criterion (e.g. travel time in table 4), but rather the relative relation among multiple criteria associated to a set of alternatives available routes. Based on this assumption, figure 5 demonstrates how this information can be disseminated in a simple spider chart in which the best performing route for a specific criteria receives a score of 10 (shortest, fastest, lowest ration of high BSP modes, lowest energy expenditure, and car overtaking). The data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point relative to the maximum magnitude of the variable across all data points. As can be seen in figure 5 there is a common pattern regarding the route ranking in the different cities. R2 (Aveiro) and R4 Porto present the best indicators in terms of energy expenditure, distance and travel time, however they have a worse result in terms of comfort. These results are important to support the decision-making process of the route choice, but also to the level of urban planning and design of new infrastructures. From the point of view of the infrastructures manager who wants to promote the use of the bicycle, it is important to minimize these trade-offs, that is, to ensure that the best routes perform optimally on all the indicators to attract a heterogenic profile of cyclists i.e. those who value the travel time, and physical effort, as well as those that privilege safety and comfort. Figure 6 shows schematically how the decision maker can contribute to minimizing these trade-offs. Dedicated infrastructure such as cycle lanes and dedicated traffic signals can be implemented to improve safety, confront and travel time. In hilly cities e-bikes can be assigned to those routes with higher levels of physical effort demand or in longer routes. Fig. 5.

Conclusions In this work, routes in different cities were empirically monitored using an instrumented bicycle. The objectives were to: determine the relative relationship between several important factors considered by cyclists to select a route and assess in what extent they can be applied in a collaborative sensing cycling platform. The major conclusions are: ï‚· For all the criteria there is a significant variability for the 3 routes connecting the same OD pair (greater than 20% for travel time, distance, safety history and comfort). ï‚· In terms of energy expenditure and comfort indices, there is a significant difference (higher < 1.7) between the flat and hilly city (justifying the modal distribution rates of the bicycles in the two study areas 2.7% vs. 0, 4%) ï‚· In terms of technical feasibility, GNSS information can be used to estimate traditional variables (travel distance, altitude profile) as the energy expenditure/physical effort result due to its strong relationship with heart rate and human energy expenditure. Current traffic information based on video processing should be replaced by low-cost distance sensors. ï‚· The identified tradeoffs and magnitude variation suggest the information provided would be useful for both cyclists with heterogeneous profiles and managing authorities to maximize attractiveness of specific routes. Other relevant data such as the number of intersections and the historical location of accidents and online traffic information (e.g., Google Maps) will be considered in the development of a navigation algorithm. In this study the data of different cyclists were aggregated into a single database. As the database is being fed by new users it will be possible to provide new indicators disaggregated by users with different profiles (age, gender, physical condition).

For this study, cyclists ride a conventional bicycle equipped with a GNSS and the energy required is quantified with Bicycle Specific Power Methodology (BSP). Cyclists also wore an equipment to record the heart rate called Vital Jacket and a video camera to record road conflicts between cyclists and cars. The aforementioned methodology was applied to three different routes chosen in the Portuguese cities of Aveiro (flat terrain) and Porto (hilly). For the flat city, the average energy expenditure was 44, 5 Wh/km while for the hilly area the energy expenditure was 96,05 Wh/km. For each origin-destination pair by choosing an appropriate route it is possible to save about 28% energy in Aveiro and 35% in Porto. Regarding route comfort, the average number of car overtaking maneuvers to the bicycle was used as indicator, while road safety was based on historical data. The tradeoffs identified and variation magnitude of variables analyzed suggest the information provided would be useful for cyclists with heterogeneous profiles as well as to support management authorities in order to maximize the attractiveness of the various routes.

In this contribution, we investigated the possibility of carrying out subject identification based on a predictive model built using machine learning techniques, and features extracted from 3-D body joint data provided by a single low-cost RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect v2). We obtained a dataset including 400 gait cycles from 20 healthy subjects, and 25 anthropometric measures and gait parameters per gait cycle. Different machine learning algorithms were explored: k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and multilayer perceptron ensemble. The algorithm that led to the model with best trade-off between the considered evaluation metrics was the random forest: overall accuracy of 99%, class accuracy of 100Â±Â0%, and F1 score of 99Â±Â2%. These results show the potential of using a RGB-D camera for subject identification based on quantitative gait analysis.",

Nevertheless, the validity of RGB-D cameras for motor function assessment in some diseases affecting gait, such as Transthyretin Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP), is yet to be investigated. In this study, the agreement between the Kinect v2 and a reference system for obtaining spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters was evaluated in the context of TTR-FAP. 3-D body joint data provided by both systems were acquired from ten TTR-FAP symptomatic patients, while performing ten gait trials. For each gait cycle, we computed several spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters. We then determined, for each parameter, the Bland Altman’s bias and 95% limits of agreement, as well as the Pearson’s and concordance correlation coefficients, between systems. The obtained results show that an affordable, portable and non-invasive system based on an RGB-D camera can accurately obtain most of the studied gait parameters (excellent or good agreement for eleven spatiotemporal and one kinematic). This system can bring more objectivity to motor function assessment of polyneuropathy patients, potentially contributing to an improvement of TTR-FAP treatment and understanding, with great benefits to the patients’ quality of life.",

One of the disease's characteristics that mostly affects patients' quality of life is its influence on locomotion, with a variable evolution timing. Quantitative motion analysis is useful for assessing motor function, including gait, in diseases affecting movement. However, it is still an evolving field, especially in TTR-FAP, with only a few available studies. A single markerless RGB-D camera provides 3-D body joint data in a less expensive, more portable and less intrusive way than reference multi-camera marker-based systems for motion capture. In this contribution, we investigate if a gait analysis system based on a RGB-D camera can be used to detect gait changes over time for a given TTR-FAP patient. 3-D data provided by that system and a reference system were acquired from six TTR-FAP patients, while performing a simple gait task, once and then a year and a half later. For each gait cycle and system, several gait parameters were computed. For each patient, we investigated if the RBG-D camera system is able to detect the existence or not of statistically significant differences between the two different acquisitions (separated by 1.5 years of disease evolution), in a similar way to the reference system. The obtained results show the potential of using a single RGB-D camera to detect relevant changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters (e.g., stride duration and stride length), during TTR-FAP patient follow-up.",

During experimental field burns, environmental and heart rate data from firefighters were collected and it was possible to observe that changes in heart rate were related with variations in pollutants inhalation. Therefore, detecting changes in heart rate may provide a good indicator to identify hazardous situations for firefighters. An automated method, based on the detection of changes in the heart rate, is proposed to prevent and to avoid serious undesirable side-effects in the health of firefighters due to pollutants inhalation. Within the experiments performed, a precision and a recall of 91.5 and 78.2%, respectively, were obtained. Furthermore, this approach can be part of a real-time decision support system for routine use in firefighting practice. Our results show the potential to provide effective support in real operational scenarios and that further research on the impact of environmental conditions in the well-being of firefighters is of utmost importance.",

In this contribution, we evaluate the validity of both Microsoft Kinect versions (v1 and v2) for motion analysis against a Qualisys system in a simultaneous protocol. Two different walking directions in relation to the Kinect (towards – WT, and away – WA) were explored. For each gait trial, measures related with all body parts were computed: velocity of all joints, distance between symmetrical joints, and angle at some joints. For each measure, we compared each Kinect version and Qualisys by obtaining the mean true error and mean absolute error, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and optical-to-depth ratio. Although both Kinect v1 and v2 and/or WT and WA data present similar accuracy for some measures, better results were achieved, overall, when using WT data provided by the Kinect v2, especially for velocity measures. Moreover, the velocity and distance presented better results than angle measures. Our results show that both Kinect versions can be an alternative to more expensive systems such as Qualisys, for obtaining distance and velocity measures as well as some angles metrics (namely the knee angles). This conclusion is important towards the off-lab non-intrusive assessment of motor function in different areas, including sports and healthcare.",

Clark et al., 2013 Gait assessment v1 n.d. 21 healthy Walking (comfortable pace) Spatiotemporal gait parameters Bland-Altman bias and 95% LoA, percentage error, r, and concordance correlation coefficient (r c) Gait speed, step length and stride length present excellent relative and overall agreement. For the remaining variables, agreement varies between poor and excellent. Galna et al., 2014 Movement measurement in Parkinson's disease patients v1 1 Kinect w/ 1 m height, tilt angle of 0°; subjects at 3 m from Kinect 9 w/ Parkinson’s disease + 10 healthy Clinically relevant tasks (including walking) Temporal and spatial measures Bland-Altman bias and 95% LoA, r, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) The Kinect accurately measures timing for all movements, and spatial characteristics for gross movements.

SMSW average walking speed was a valid parameter asdemonstrated by retest reliability results and the strongcorrelation with established clinical scores. Xu & McGorry, 2015 Kinect's joint tracking algorithm evaluation v1 and v2 n.d. 20 + 20 healthy Standing and sitting postures Joint position (time series) Distance between joint position provided by Kinect and ground truth system Accuracy is better for standing than sitting, and for upper than lower limb joints. The average error for all joints is slightly higher for Kinect v2 comparing with v1 (difference of 1 cm). Clark et al., 2015 Standing balance and postural control assessment v2 Subjects at 2.5 m from Kinect 30 healthy Standing and dynamic balance tasks Trunk angle range; sternum and pelvis range and path length Bland-Altman plots with 95% LoA, and r Relative agreement was excellent for trunk angle (dynamic tasks), as well as for anterior-posterior range and path length (static tasks). For the medial–lateral range an path length, the agreement varied between poor and modest for all static tasks expect one. Xu et al., 2015 Gait assessment during treadmill walking v1 1 Kinect in front of treadmill 20 healthy Treadmill walking (three different speeds) Spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters Bland-Altman bias, r and r c (spatiotemporal parameters); Bland-Altman bias (kinematic parameters and associated timing); root mean square error (angle at knee and hip, joint time series) Accuracy varies across the gait parameters. The Kinect is able to follow the trend of the knee and hip joint trajectories, despite substantial error in magnitudes. Mentiplay et al., 2015 Gait assessment v2 n.d. 30 healthy Walking (comfortable and fast pace) Spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters Bland-Altman plots, r, and r c Most spatiotemporal parameters presented excellent agreement, while agreement was poor to modest for kinematic parameters .

Capecci et al., 2016 Low-back pain rehabilitation v2 n.d. 12 healthy Low-back pain physiotherapy exercises Joint angle, distance, and position Absolute and relative error for maximum and minimum value (angle and position); offset and root mean square error (distance); absolute error for time-peak distance (angle and position) Temporal accuracy: Kinect v2 can accurately measure timing characteristics of physical exercises. Spatial accuracy: Better for tasks involving upper limbs comparing with lower limbs. Otte et al., 2016 Clinical measurement of motor function v2 1 Kinect w/ 1.4 m height, tilt angle of − 8° 19 healthy Sitting, standing and walking tasks Joint position (21 out of 25 joints); spatiotemporal and kinematic measures Distance, r, and signal to noise ratio (SNR) for joint position provided by Kinect and ground truth system; Bland-Altman bias and 95% LoA, r, and ICC, for the spatiotemporal and kinematic measures Accuracy of Kinect v2 joint estimation is moderate to excellent, w/ larger noise for ankles and feet. Agreement is good to excellent for most spatiotemporal and kinematic measures. Behrens et al., 2016 Visual perceptive computing (VPC) for static posturography v1 1 Kinect w/ 1.4 m height, mean distance of 2.3 m 90 w/ Multiple Sclerosis + 59 healthy Static stance tests in three conditions with eyes open and closed. Body’s centre of mass displacement Clinical scores and intra-class correlation coefficients at retest Closed stance test showed best applicability and reliability.

Better accuracy for two-sided than one-sided setup, mainly due to better lower body joint tracking. Excellent agreement for all gait parameters for two-sided setup. Temporal synchronization between Kinects is essential. Napoli et al., 2017 Dynamic posture assessment v2 2 Kinects placed at 2 m and 4 m in front of the subject 4 healthy Several dynamic postures Joint displacement (time series) Cross correlation coefficients (CCR), root mean squared error (RMSE), and a new summary metric combining the two first metrics High levels of agreement when tracking joint displacements, but lower agreement levels were achieved when tracking joint angles.

RGB-D cameras provide 3-D body joint data in a low-cost, portable and non-intrusive way, when compared with reference motion capture systems used in laboratory settings. In this contribution, we evaluate the validity of both Microsoft Kinect versions (v1 and v2) for motion analysis against a Qualisys system in a simultaneous protocol. Two different walking directions in relation to the Kinect (towards – WT, and away – WA) were explored. For each gait trial, measures related with all body parts were computed: velocity of all joints, distance between symmetrical joints, and angle at some joints. For each measure, we compared each Kinect version and Qualisys by obtaining the mean true error and mean absolute error, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and optical-to-depth ratio. Although both Kinect v1 and v2 and/or WT and WA data present similar accuracy for some measures, better results were achieved, overall, when using WT data provided by the Kinect v2, especially for velocity measures. Moreover, the velocity and distance presented better results than angle measures. Our results show that both Kinect versions can be an alternative to more expensive systems such as Qualisys, for obtaining distance and velocity measures as well as some angles metrics (namely the knee angles). This conclusion is important towards the off-lab non-intrusive assessment of motor function in different areas, including sports and healthcare. Keywords RGB-D camera Kinect Qualisys System validity 3-D motion analysis Gait 1 Introduction A single RGB-D camera, such as the Microsoft Kinect, is able to track the 3-D position of several body joints, without interfering with the scene or requiring calibration. Currently, there are two versions of this sensor: Kinect v1 (Kv1, released in 2010), and Kinect v2 (Kv2, released in 2014). Data provided by the Kinect includes RGB images, depth information, and 3-D position of twenty and twenty-five body joints for Kv1 and Kv2, respectively. The Kv2 further provides infrared images. These sensors are low-cost and portable, when compared with reference systems (e.g., Vicon or Qualisys) typically only available in specialized laboratories and requiring complex and time-consuming setups. To ensure that the information provided by RGB-D cameras is trustworthy for the intended application, it is important to evaluate its accuracy for a specific goal against a reference system. An overview of the state-of-the-art using the Kinect for motion assessment is presented in Table 1 , including studies related with posture and balance (Behrens et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2012; Clark et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015), gait (Behrens et al., 2014; Pfister et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2013; Mentiplay et al., 2015; Muller et al., 2017), movement-related diseases (Chen et al., 2017; Galna et al., 2014; Grobelny et al., 2017), rehabilitation (Capecci et al., 2016) and joint position estimation (Otte et al., 2016; Xu and McGorry, 2015; Xu et al., 2015, Napoli et al., 2017). To our knowledge, no contribution compared both Kinects simultaneously in the context of gait. When conducting gait analysis, researchers usually rely only on data acquired while participants walk towards the sensor (Clark et al., 2012; Galna et al., 2014; Geerse et al., 2015; Muller et al., 2017; Otte et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2015). This requires the subject to perform multiple repetitions to acquire sufficient data. If walking away from the sensor and towards it present comparable quality and usefulness, the former data could also be used, bringing benefits (reduced entropy and time) to gait-related applications. In this contribution, we evaluate the validity of both Kv1 and Kv2 for 3-D gait analysis when compared with a reference multi-camera marker-based system (Qualisys). We aim to study the compromise in terms of accuracy when using a single RGB-D camera, mimicking a possible clinical scenario. We acquired 3-D body joint data from twenty healthy subjects during ten trials consisting of walking towards (WT) and away (WA) from the Kinects. For each trial, we compared each Kinect version with Qualisys by obtaining the mean true and mean absolute errors, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and optical-to-depth ratio, for several measures associated with all body parts (velocity, distance and angle). 2 Methods 2.1 Subjects and experimental setup Our experiment was conducted at LABIOMEP (Porto Biomechanics Laboratory), with the participation of twenty healthy individuals (10 male and 10 female, age: 30.5 ± 8.07 [22–51] years, height: 1.71 ± 10.9 [1.50–1.94] m, body mass index: 23.1 ± 3.2 [17–31] kg/m2). Results presented below are only applicable to cohorts of the same age range. None of the participants had any history of movement impairment or physical limitation. This study was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of Santo António University Hospital (Portugal). All participants signed an informed consent form. The experimental setup comprised three systems: Qualisys system (Qualisys AB, Sweden), Kv1 and Kv2 (Microsoft Corporation, USA). The Qualisys system included 12 Oqus infrared cameras, and thirty-six retroreflective markers placed on the subject’s body according to the marker setup used in (Rocha et al., 2018). The Kinects were placed in front of the subject, at a height of 1 m, with a tilt angle of −10°/−5° (Kv1/Kv2), as shown in (Rocha et al., 2018). The angle was chosen to maximize the practical depth range: 1.84 m (WT) and 2.06 m (WA) for Kv1; 2.71 m (WT) and 2.66 m (WA) for Kv2. 2.2 Experimental protocol and data acquisition For each participant, the experiment consisted of performing ten gait trials (20 subjects, 200 trials). Each trial included walking towards (WT) the RGB-D cameras and walking away (WA) from them, for 14 m, at a self-selected comfortable pace. Data provided by the Kinects were acquired simultaneously at 30 Hz, using our KinecTracker (KiT) software application that enables online visualization and acquisition of the data provided by a Kinect (Cunha et al., 2016). At the same time, the 3-D position of the Qualisys markers were acquired at 200 Hz. The body joints tracked by both versions of the Kinect are shown in (Rocha et al., 2015). The joint nomenclature used in this contribution follows the Kv2 labelling (Microsoft, 2018). Body joints tracked exclusively by Kv2 were not considered. 2.3 Data processing Qualisys data were processed using a zero-lag low-pass fourth order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 15 Hz (values chosen based on the signals’ frequency content). For both Kinects, joint data were filtered using a similar filter but with a cut-off frequency of 4 Hz. Furthermore, Kinect data were resampled to 200 Hz so that data from all systems have an identical fixed sampling rate. The synchronization of the three systems was possible using a specific temporal event visible to all of them: dropping an extra marker at the beginning of each trial. The following measures were computed for each frame: velocity of all 20 joints; distance between symmetrical joints; angle at specific joints (Rocha et al., 2014). Trials with outliers for Qualisys data were not taken into account. Data corresponding to WT and WA trials were automatically selected based on data provided by the Kinects. Further information on data processing is presented in Supplementary Data. 2.4 System validation For each trial and measure, we computed the mean true error and mean absolute error, Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and optical-to-depth ratio (ODR), between the time series obtained from each Kinect version and Qualisys. The mean true error is the mean value for the difference between the Kinect and Qualisys values for all frames. The mean absolute error is similar, but the absolute difference value is considered. The correlation coefficient r shows the strength and direction of the relationship between two signals. The following thresholds were set for r, according to the guidelines given by Portney and Watkins (Portney and Watkins, 2015): poor (<0.5), moderate (≥0.5 and <0.75), good (≥0.75 and <0.9) and excellent (≥0.9). ODR quantifies the noise behavior of the Kinect when compared with Qualisys. ODR was computed based on signal-to-noise ratio definition using (1), where var(Qualisys) is the variance of the measure extracted from Qualisys data and var(Kinect − Qualisys) is the variance of the true error of the Kinect comparing with Qualisys (Otte et al., 2016). Large negative values (< −10 dB) indicate that the Kinect data has considerably more noise than Qualisys data. An ODR value higher than 10 dB indicates that the difference between the two systems’ signals is negligible (the variance of the Qualisys signal is 10 times larger than the noise variance). (1) ODR = 10 log 10 var ( Q u a l i s y s ) var ( K i n e c t - Q u a l i s y s ) d B To verify if there are statistically significant differences between the four considered cases (Kv1 + WT, Kv1 + WA, Kv2 + WT, Kv2 + WA), we performed a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), for each measure and evaluation metric. If a significant difference was detected (p-value ≤ 0.05), a post-hoc Tukey test was then carried out to find which cases are significantly different. All data processing and statistical analysis described in this section were performed in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc.), except for the ANOVA and Tukey tests which were performed in the R environment (version 3.5.1) (R Core Team, 2015). 3 Results Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation values for the mean true error and mean absolute error, Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and ODR, for each measure, body segment/joint, Kinect version and walking trial (WT or WA). Complete results obtained for each individual joint are available on Supplementary Tables S8–S16. The results consider the following body segments: trunk (head, neck, spine base, spine middle), upper limbs (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands), upper-lower limbs (upper-LL: hips and knees) and lower-LL (ankles and feet). Fig. 1 illustrates the correlation coefficient results for the different measures, body segments/joints, Kinect versions and WT/WA trials. 4 Discussion Comparing the two Kinect versions, the obtained mean errors were overall lower for Kv2, which may be due to the improvements made to the tracking algorithm over Kv1. Although Wang et al. evaluated other measures and activities (Wang et al., 2015), our findings are in accordance with their results. Furthermore, the mean error for velocity and distance measures was lower for upper than lower limbs (LL) – in agreement with (Capecci et al., 2016; Xu and McGorry, 2015). This error tends to be higher for joints closer to the ground, which was expected due to the greater movement of the limbs’ extremities during gait and possible interferences from infrared reflections on the floor. On the other hand, for the velocity, trunk and upper-LL have the lowest ODR values. For WT trials, correlation is excellent (upper limbs and lower-LL) or good. Analyzing the opposite direction (WA), correlation is excellent and good for the lower-LL (Kv1 and Kv2, respectively), moderate for trunk and upper-LL, and good for other segments. Velocity measures extracted from Kinects data are noisier than Qualisys data, which is reflected in lower ODR values. As for the distance, the mean estimation errors are between 1 and 11 cm, which is in line with the literature (Clark et al., 2015; Galna et al., 2014) and may be acceptable for some applications. However, caution should be taken when preparing or interpreting fine movements' studies. Nevertheless, correlation is excellent or good for all considered body segments, Kinect versions and walking directions. Additionally, the mean ODR values are higher for distances than for the other measures. When analyzing angle measures, correlation ranges from moderate (hips and upper limbs) to poor, and mean ODR values are low (except for the knees, which may be due to the higher range of motion). For WA, the trunk and ankle angles have the worst mean r and ODR values. To the best of our knowledge, no other study analyzed upper body angles during gait. The poor results for most joint angles, when compared with other measures, can be due to the angle computation involving three joints. Thus, less accurate joint position estimations have a larger negative effect. Moreover, the physical configuration of the RGB-D sensors may not be the most adequate for measuring angles. Further studies are necessary to verify if angle measurement can be improved. Although for some cases there are no statistically significant differences between Kv1 and Kv2 and/or between WT and WA, significant differences were found between two or more of the four considered conditions (Kv1 + WT, Kv1 + WA, Kv2 + WT, Kv2 + WA) for most measures/metrics. For the velocity measures, the best results are achieved when using the Kv2 and WT data, overall. However, for the distance and angle measures, this depends on the considered joint. Although further investigation is needed, from the present study, it seems that WA data may be used in some cases. In conclusion, our results show that both Kinect versions can be an alternative to more expensive and intrusive reference systems, such as Qualisys, for obtaining distance and velocity measures as well as some angle measures (namely the knee angles). However, as the practical depth range is larger for Kv2, using it allows acquiring more data for the same number of trials. Regarding the comparison between WT and WA, although for some joints both data can be used with similar accuracy, better results were achieved, overall, for the traditional approach of using WT (especially for velocity measures). 5 Data availability The dataset used is available with the corresponding author.

The objective is to deploy general-purpose, proven monitoring frameworks to enhance the analytical capabilities of teams monitoring, not only for tracking the position of individuals, but also to monitor their physiology and detect alarming conditions. The proposed system, PhisioStream, leverages on streams processing tools, especially the Apache Kafka suite, and Grafana for advanced visualization. The mission command is able to gather both current and historical physiology of each member in a rich dashboard. Advanced users can reconfigure the dashboard, for different views of the missions' data, without the need for coding new features.",

Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Previous studies have successfully used augmented reality (AR) as an aid to exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have measured the physiological correlates of the fear response, relying solely on self-reports and behavioral avoidance tests. Methods: As the physiological defensive reactivity pattern impacts on the treatment effectiveness, we tested the feasibility of an AR system integrated in a mobile and wearable device for assessing the psychophysiological mechanisms (heart rate) involved in fear responses in real-life contexts. Specific phobia was used as a model given its prototypical defensive hyperreactivity toward the feared stimulus (spiders to spider phobics, in the current study). Results: The results showed that the stimuli presented using AR were able to induce physiological alterations in the participants, which were specific depending on the stimulus type (fear or neutral) and on the participants’ level of spider fear (phobic and control group). These physiological correlates of the fear response were reflected both in the intensity of heart rate (in relation to the baseline) and in the time needed to react and recover after the stimulus exposure. Finally, we tested a theoretical model that showed that the physiological responses of phobic individuals when facing their phobic stimulus only explained its own data. Conclusions: We argue in favor of the system's feasibility at capturing and quantifying the physiological dimension of fear-related responses, which may be of great value for diagnostic and treatment purposes in anxiety disorders, namely specific phobia.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Human gait analysis provides valuable information regarding the way of walking of a given subject. Low-cost RGB-D cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, are able to estimate the 3-D position of several body joints without requiring the use of markers. This 3-D information can be used to perform objective gait analysis in an affordable, portable, and non-intrusive way. In this contribution, we present a system for fully automatic gait analysis using a single RGB-D camera, namely the second version of the Kinect. Our system does not require any manual intervention (except for starting/stopping the data acquisition), since it firstly recognizes whether the subject is walking or not, and identifies the different gait cycles only when walking is detected. For each gait cycle, it then computes several gait parameters, which can provide useful information in various contexts, such as sports, healthcare, and biometric identification. The activity recognition is performed by a predictive model that distinguishes between three activities (walking, standing and marching), and between two postures of the subject (facing the sensor, and facing away from it). The model was built using a multilayer perceptron algorithm and several measures extracted from 3-D joint data, achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 98%. For gait cycle detection, we implemented an algorithm that estimates the instants corresponding to left and right heel strikes, relying on the distance between ankles, and the velocity of left and right ankles. The algorithm achieved errors for heel strike instant and stride duration estimation of 15 ± 25 ms and 1 ± 29 ms (walking towards the sensor), and 12 ± 23 ms and 2 ± 24 ms (walking away from the sensor). Our gait cycle detection solution can be used with any other RGB-D camera that provides the 3-D position of the main body joints.",

All rights reservedNowadays, some drone Flight Controllers (FCs) support basic automation (e.g., GPS waypoint, return-to-home, path flight, take-off/landing), although it requires direct drone connectivity (e.g., radio, base station/Ground Control Station (GCS)) and an extensive knowledge over technical details (e.g., assembly, configuration, battery maintenance, flight, etc.). This paper proposes a novel platform that offers an abstraction layer between the end-user and the drone itself, automating most of the drone flight requirements. The platform allows to perform high-level drones control (e.g., up, down, left, right, GPS go-to and stream follow, return to base, etc.) through end-user communications, contributing with a highly modular event-driven control platform, enabling development of more complex integrations between drones and other technologies. The obtained results show that the proposed automated flying drones’ platform is able to properly abstract and decouple the direct control, handling up to 32 drones with no significant impact on the performance. The platform is also capable of displaying and correlating sensor metrics obtained in real-time during flight.",

Our system provides a full stack integration of the information into a city dashboard that displays and correlates the data generated from buses and fixed sensors, allowing different visualizations over the traffic and environment in the city, and decisions over the current status of the city.

Several attempts at quantifying seizure movements have been performed in the past using 2D marker-based approaches, which have several drawbacks for the clinical routine (e.g. occlusions, lack of precision, and discomfort for the patient). These drawbacks are overcome with a 3D markerless approach. Recently, we published the development of a single-bed 3Dvideo-EEG system using a single RGB-D camera (Kinect v1). In this contribution, we describe how we expanded the previous single-bed system to a multi-bed departmental one that has been managing 6.61 Terabytes per day since March 2016. Our unique dataset collected so far includes 2.13 Terabytes of multimedia data, corresponding to 278 3Dvideo-EEG seizures from 111 patients. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this system is unique and has the potential of being spread to multiple EMUs around the world for the benefit of a greater number of patients.",

In this work, we propose the Intrinsic Page Hinkley Test (iPHT), which enhances the Page Hinkley Test (PHT) eliminating the user-defined parameter (the allowed magnitude of change of the data that are not considered real distribution change of the data stream) by using the second order intrinsic mode function (IMF) which is a data dependent value reflecting the intrinsic data variation. In such way, the PHT change detection method is expected to be more robust and require less tunes. Furthermore, we extend the proposed iPHT to a blockwise approach. Computing the IMF over sliding windows, which is shown to be more responsive to changes and suitable for online settings. The iPHT is evaluated using artificial and real data, outperforming the PHT.",

Human motion analysis is regarded as fundamental towards an early diagnosis and enhanced follow-up in this type of diseases. In this contribution, we present NeuroKinect, a novel system designed for motion analysis in neurological diseases. This system includes an RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) and two integrated software applications, KiT (KinecTracker) and KiMA (Kinect Motion Analyzer). The applications enable the preview, acquisition, review and management of data provided by the sensor, which are then used for motion analysis of relevant events. NeuroKinect is a portable, low-cost and markerless solution that is suitable for use in the clinical environment. Furthermore, it is able to provide quantitative support to the clinical assessment of different neurological diseases with movement impairments, as demonstrated by its usage in two different clinical routine scenarios: gait analysis in Parkinson's disease and seizure semiology analysis in epilepsy.",

This study main goal is to estimate firefighters' pollutants inhalation when in operational scenarios by combining environmental and physiological information. Both exposures to CO (carbon monoxide) and physiological data, such as ECG (electrocardiogram), HR (Heart Rate) and body temperature, were monitored during firefighters' activities in experimental forest fire. From the QRS complex of ECG the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) was estimated and convoluted with pollutants concentration to estimate individual smoke inhalation. The analysis of smoke inhalations allowed to detect extensive exposures and to identify critical situations namely risk of faint due to smoke intoxication. Our results support the usefulness of continuous monitoring of both physiological and environmental information to prevent and detect hazardous situations while firefighters are in operational scenario like forest fires. The results encourage the development of a decision support system to be applied in real-Time during firefighting scenarios.",

However, that is not always possible. Given that phobias are rather context-specific, their study is the ideal candidate to assess the feasibility of using a mobile and wearable device for obtaining physiological and behavioral data. In this article, we propose BeMonitored, a smartphone-based solution to support more ecologically valid monitoring of psychological experiments. BeMonitored delivers customizable, specific context-dependent audiovisual stimuli and uses external resources connected via Bluetooth or a smartphone’s own resources, while capturing the participant’s behavior, physiology, and environment. We used BeMonitored in a spider phobia case study and showed that spider phobics differed from control participants in face motion, captured by the smartphone camera. Moreover, our results also revealed heart rate differences between spider and neutral stimuli in phobic participants. The presented results emphasize the usefulness of smartphones for phobia monitoring. Considering their intrinsic characteristics, smartphones may constitute the natural evolution from the lab to more realistic contexts.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder which affects 0.5-1% of the world population. Its diagnosis relies both on Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings and characteristic seizure induced body movements called seizure semiology. Thus, synchronous EEG and (2D)video recording systems (known as VideoEEG) are the most accurate tools for epilepsy diagnosis. Despite the establishment of several quantitative methods for EEG analysis, seizure semiology is still analyzed by visual inspection, based on epileptologists' subjective interpretation of the movements of interest (MOIs) that occur during recorded seizures. In this contribution, we present NeuroKinect, a low-cost, easy to setup and operate solution for a novel 3Dvideo-EEG system. It is based on a RGB-D sensor (Microsoft Kinect camera) and performs 24/7 monitoring of an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) bed. It does not require the attachment of any reflectors or sensors to the patient's body and has a very low maintenance load. To evaluate its performance and usability, we mounted a state-ofthe-Art 6-camera motion-capture system and our low-cost solution over the same EMU bed. A comparative study of seizure-simulated MOIs showed an average correlation of the resulting 3D motion trajectories of 84.2%. Then, we used our system on the routine of an EMU and collected 9 different seizures where we could perform 3D kinematic analysis of 42 MOIs arising from the temporal (TLE) (n = 19) and extratemporal (ETE) brain regions (n = 23). The obtained results showed that movement displacement and movement extent discriminated both seizure MOI groups with statistically significant levels (mean = 0.15 m vs. 0.44 m, p0.001; mean = 0.068 m3 vs. 0.14 m3, p0.05, respectively). Furthermore, TLE MOIs were significantly shorter than ETE (mean = 23 seconds vs 35 seconds, p0.01) and presented higher jerking levels (mean = 345 ms3 vs 172 ms3, p0.05). Our newly implemented 3D approach is faster by 87.5% in extracting body motion trajectories when compared to a 2D frame by frame tracking procedure. We conclude that this new approach provides a more comfortable (both for patients and clinical professionals), simpler, faster and lower-cost procedure than previous approaches, therefore providing a reliable tool to quantitatively analyze MOI patterns of epileptic seizures in the routine of EMUs around the world. We hope this study encourages other EMUs to adopt similar approaches so that more quantitative information is used to improve epilepsy diagnosis.",

To accomplish this purpose, AWARE delivers context dependent audio-visual stimuli, embedded into the subject's real-world perception, via marker/vision-based augmented reality (AR) technology. In addition, it employs external measuring resources connected via Bluetooth, as well as the smartphone's integrated resources. It synchronously acquires the experiment's video (camera input with AR overlay), physiologic responses (with a dedicated ECG measuring device) and behavior (through movement and location, with accelerometer/gyroscope and GPS, respectively). Psychological assessment is heavily based on laboratory procedures, even though it is known that these settings disturb the subjects' natural reactions and condition. The major idea of this application is to evaluate the participant condition, mimicking his/her real life conditions. Given that phobias are rather context specific, they represent the ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of a mobile system application. AWARE allowed presenting AR stimuli (e.g., 3D spiders) and quantifying the subjects' reactions non-intrusively (e.g., heart rate variation) - more emphatic in the phobic volunteer when presented with spider vs non phobic stimulus. Although still a proof of concept, AWARE proved to be flexible, and straightforward to setup, with the potential to support ecologically valid monitoring experiments.",

In this study, 3-D body joint data were acquired from both normal subjects, and PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Then, several gait parameters were extracted from the gathered data. The obtained results show that 96% of the considered parameters are appropriate for distinguishing between non-PD subjects, PD patients with DBS stimulator switched on, and PD patients with stimulator switched off (p-value < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). These results are markedly better than the ones obtained using Kinect v1, where only 73% of the parameters are considered appropriate (p-value < 0.001).",

To cope with different setups, different sensors and computing devices, found in the evolution of the VitalResponder project, we adopted a message brokering pattern to isolate the data aggregation logic from the changing hardware and networking configurations. Sensors publish data to local message brokers (body-area level), that, in turn, publish to higher level messages queues (site-wide level). The brokers use adapters to relay messages over alternative transport protocols, currently available as adapters for messaging standards over TCP (AMQP, MQTT), over UDP (CoAP), and basic sockets (TCP and UDP). The abstraction of messages brokering facilitates the portability to different platforms, and the system has been tested in Android, Raspberry Pi and standard Linux devices, to support a distributed sensor network for firefighter's missions monitoring.",

Human motion analysis techniques can be very useful to support clinical assessment of this type of diseases. In this contribution, we present a RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) system and its evaluation for PD assessment. Based on skeleton data extracted from the gait of three PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation and three control subjects, several gait parameters were computed and analyzed, with the aim of discriminating between non-PD and PD subjects, as well as between two PD states (stimulator ON and OFF). We verified that among the several quantitative gait parameters, the variance of the center shoulder velocity presented the highest discriminative power to distinguish between non-PD, PD ON and PD OFF states (p = 0.004). Furthermore, we have shown that our low-cost portable system can be easily mounted in any hospital environment for evaluating patients' gait. These results demonstrate the potential of using a RGB-D camera as a PD assessment tool.",

In the present study, we determined the duration of both the movement execution and pauses of monkeys performing a synchronization-continuation task (SCT), using the speed profile of their tapping behavior. We found a linear increase in the variance of pause-duration as a function of interval, while the variance of the motor implementation was relatively constant across intervals. In fact, 96% of the variability of the duration of a complete tapping cycle (pause + movement) was due to the variability of the pause duration. In addition, we performed a Bayesian model selection to determine the effect of interval duration (450 -1,000 ms), serial-order (1-6 produced intervals), task phase (sensory cued or internally driven), and marker modality (auditory or visual) on the duration of the movement-pause and tapping movement. The results showed that the most important parameter used to successfully perform the SCT was the control of the pause duration. We also found that the kinematics of the tapping movements was concordant with a stereotyped ballistic control of the hand pressing the push-button. The present findings support the idea that monkeys used an explicit timing strategy to perform the SCT, where a dedicated timing mechanism controlled the duration of the pauses of movement, while also triggered the execution of fixed movements across each interval of the rhythmic sequence. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.",

However, an issue that frequently hampers such composition is data-mismatches between computational entities. Although, many composition frameworks today provide support for data mismatch resolution through special-purpose data converters, end users still have to put significant effort in dealing with data mismatches, e.g., identifying the available converters and determining which of them meet their QoS expectations. In this paper we present an approach that eliminates this effort by automating the detection and resolution of data mismatches. Specifically, it uses architectural abstractions to automatically detect different types of data mismatches, model-generation techniques to fix those mismatches, and utility theory to decide the best fix based on QoS constraints. We illustrate our approach in the neuroscience domain where data-mismatches can be fixed in an efficient manner on the order of few seconds. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

        "doc_abstract": "We quantitatively evaluated the localizing and lateralizing characteristics of ictal upper limb automatisms (ULAs) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; n. = 38) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE; n. = 20). Movement speed, extent, length, and duration of ULAs were quantitatively analyzed with motion capturing techniques. Upper limb automatisms had a larger extent (p. <. 0.001), covered more distance (p. <. 0.05), and were faster (p. <. 0.001) in FLE than in TLE. In TLE, the maximum speed of ULAs was higher ipsilaterally than contralaterally (173 vs. 84. pixels/s; p. = 0.02), with no significant difference in FLE (511 vs. 428). The duration of ictal automatisms in relation to the total seizure duration was shorter in TLE than in FLE (median 36% vs. 63%; p. <. 0.001), with no difference in the absolute duration (26. s vs. 27. s). These results demonstrate that quantitative movement analysis of ULAs differentiates FLE from TLE, which may aid in the localization of the epileptogenic zone. Seizure semiology is used in presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. Upper limb automatisms (ULAs) in FLE and TLE are clinically hard to distinguish. Quantitative methods show significant differences of ULAs in FLE and TLE. ULAs in FLE are faster and cover longer distances with larger extent than in TLE. These results may aid presurgical diagnosis of the seizure onset zone. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Fax: +49 89 70 95 3677. 1 Both authors contributed equally. We quantitatively evaluated the localizing and lateralizing characteristics of ictal upper limb automatisms (ULAs) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; n=38) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE; n=20). Movement speed, extent, length, and duration of ULAs were quantitatively analyzed with motion capturing techniques. Upper limb automatisms had a larger extent (p<0.001), covered more distance (p<0.05), and were faster (p<0.001) in FLE than in TLE. In TLE, the maximum speed of ULAs was higher ipsilaterally than contralaterally (173 vs. 84pixels/s; p=0.02), with no significant difference in FLE (511 vs. 428). The duration of ictal automatisms in relation to the total seizure duration was shorter in TLE than in FLE (median 36% vs. 63%; p<0.001), with no difference in the absolute duration (26s vs. 27s). These results demonstrate that quantitative movement analysis of ULAs differentiates FLE from TLE, which may aid in the localization of the epileptogenic zone. Keywords Temporal lobe epilepsy Frontal lobe epilepsy Epileptic automatism Lateralization Quantitative movement analysis 1 Introduction The analysis of seizure semiology is well established in the evaluation of patients with epilepsy, especially when considering epilepsy surgery [1]. Semiology may lateralize as demonstrated in unilateral ictal motor activity (for example hand dystonia [2] or head version [3,4]) or in postictal paresis [5], which all suggest a contralateral seizure origin. Semiology may even localize – for example, the evolution from abdominal aura to seizures characterized by manual and oral automatisms (automotor seizure [6]) suggests temporal lobe epilepsy [7]. Despite yielding very helpful information, the qualitative visual analysis of these phenomena is prone to interobserver bias and associated with poor interobserver reliability, reducing their clinical significance [8]. We developed a technical answer to overcome this problem, based on a computerized method to quantify and analyze patient movements [9–12]. This setup enabled us, for example, to resolve the controversy on the lateralizing significance of head version by demonstrating that contralateral head version lasts longer and consistently follows ipsilateral head turning [4]. This quantitative movement analysis also allowed differentiation of head version in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [3]. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate whether ictal upper limb automatisms (ULAs) may distinguish TLE from FLE. 2 Methods 2.1 Patient and seizure selection We searched the digital video archive of the University of Munich Epilepsy Monitoring Unit using the terms “temporal lobe epilepsy” and “frontal lobe epilepsy” in combination with “automatisms” [6,13]. Ictal automatisms are repetitive movements, where the single motion may seem intentional and directed like grasping the blanket but where the repetition renders the movement sequence unintentional and inadequate [6,13]. Due to the restrictions of a two-dimensional analysis of movements, we only analyzed video recordings of seizures where the patients' coronal plane remained perpendicularly to the camera according to a previously defined geometric model for two-dimensional video analysis [4,10]. Movements of trunk and both upper limbs had to be continuously visible throughout the course of the automatisms on the video recordings, and the main movements had to be in the plane of the video in order to include the seizure video for further analysis. Thus, many seizures could not be included in the analysis due to the restrictions of the two-dimensional analysis. To avoid selection bias, only one habitual seizure per patient was included. Two experienced epileptologists independently analyzed the seizure semiology. Both investigators were blinded to the clinical information and outcome data of the patients. The patients' syndrome diagnoses were based on the results of the EEG-video epilepsy monitoring and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET], and ictal and interictal single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) and neuropsychological testing. Continuous noninvasive EEG-video-monitoring lasting at least three days was performed in all patients. Electroencephalography with 10–10 system surface electrodes was performed using 40–128 channel EEG machines (XLTEK, London, Ontario/Canada and Vanguard, Cleveland, OH/USA). Ictal and interictal EEG data were assessed according to a published EEG classification [14]. The epilepsy syndrome diagnosis was defined in a patient management meeting attended by epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, and neuropsychologists based on the localizing results of all available investigations [1]. Lateralization was defined for each seizure based on the ictal EEG discharges at seizure onset. Patients gave informed consent to the use of their data. 2.2 Seizure duration We measured the duration of seizures (in seconds [s]) based on EEG onset and EEG end. Clinical onset was used instead of EEG onset if it preceded the EEG seizure onset (14 of 38 seizures in TLE and 11 of 20 seizures in FLE). The duration of ictal automatisms in relation to the total seizure duration was calculated. 2.3 Movement quantification Infrared reflective markers were attached to different points of the patient's body. Details of the movement analysis methodology have been published previously [4,9–11]. Selected markers were tracked by analyzing all 25 video frames per second during the entire seizure with custom in-house programs developed over the MATLAB 7.4 platform (MathWorks Inc., USA, www.mathworks.com) and the MaxTraq 2.1 software (Innovision Systems, Inc., Michigan, USA, www.innovision-systems.com). Using this approach, we tracked the 2D coordinates (x, y) of 3 points of the patient's body: both wrists and a reference on the trunk. For selected patients (n=12), with ictal finger movements that were not obstructed by objects and could be analyzed, we tracked the finger using a point on the wrist of the same hand as the reference point. This procedure resulted in 2D movement trajectories such as the example depicted in Fig. 1 . Examples of this procedure are demonstrated in the Supplementary material. Length of movement (displacement traveled by a marker during the total time of automotor movement, in pixel), movement extent of wrists/fingers (area of the 2D extremities of the trajectories, in pixel2), and maximum and average speed (in pixel/s) were analyzed [9–11]. All movements were compared as ipsilateral and contralateral upper limb automatisms with regard to the side of the ictal EEG seizure pattern. 2.4 Statistical analysis We chose 20 FLE seizures based on a sample size calculation dependent on the movement parameter results from a previous study [15]. We assumed a 50% difference for the results of movement speed with similar standard deviations and demanded a power of 80%, choosing an alpha error level of <0.05. Median and average as well as standard deviations (SD) were calculated for the quantitative movement parameters. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the symmetry of upper limb automatisms and to compare quantitative parameters between patients with TLE and patients with FLE for ipsilateral and contralateral upper limb automatisms. Categorical data were compared with Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was considered when p<0.05. Multiple testing was accounted for by a Bonferroni Holm review, but no statistically significant result had to be rejected. 3 Results 3.1 Patients We included 38 seizures of 38 patients with TLE and 20 seizures of 20 patients with FLE in the study. The demographic data and seizure semiologies are listed in Supplementary material Tables 1 and 2 . Epilepsy surgery was performed on 20 of the 38 patients with TLE and 7 of the 20 patients with FLE. The outcome was only classified as either free of any seizure type or not seizure-free due to different lengths of follow-up. Seizure freedom of at least one year after surgery was achieved in 5 of the 7 operated patients with FLE and 14 of the 20 operated patients with TLE (not statistically different). 3.2 Quantitative movement analysis Upper limb automatisms of patients with FLE presented a larger extent (p<0.001), covered more distance (p<0.05), were faster (p<0.02), and had faster maxima (p<0.001; Fig. 2 ) than those of patients with TLE, both ipsilaterally and contralaterally (Table 1). The maximum speed of ULAs was much higher ipsilaterally than contralaterally to the seizure onset side in TLE (median ipsilateral 173 vs. contralateral 84pixels/s; p=0.02), whereas in FLE, no significant difference was found (median ipsilateral 511 vs. contralateral 428pixels/s). There was a trend towards a longer distance covered by contralateral than ipsilateral ULAs in TLE (median 411 vs. 186pixels; p=0.07), which was not the case in FLE (median 1025 vs. 948pixels). 3.3 Seizure duration The median total seizure duration was longer in TLE (82±38s) compared with FLE (40±33s) (p<0.001). However, the median duration of ictal upper limb automatisms was similar in TLE (26±17s) and FLE (27±14s). Thus, the proportion of time spent with upper limb automatisms compared with the total seizure duration was significantly smaller in TLE than in FLE (36% vs. 63% of the total seizure duration, p<0.001, Table 1). 3.4 Results of the subgroup of seizure-free patients In order to overcome possible ambiguity regarding the exact localization of the epileptogenic zone in our study population, a subgroup analysis was performed on the seizure-free patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery. For the seizure-free subgroup, similar results (with higher levels of significance) were obtained (Fig. 3 , Table 2). 4 Discussion This study shows that quantitative movement analysis provides objective data that differentiate TLE from FLE through their ictal upper limb automatisms (ULAs). Upper limb automatisms in FLE are faster and cover longer distances with larger extent than in TLE. The results of the seizure-free subgroup, which constitute the gold standard of correct localization in epilepsy surgery, corroborate the overall group results with even higher levels of statistical significance. 4.1 Differentiating automatisms by movement analysis Automatisms of the upper limbs have not been previously compared quantitatively between FLE and TLE. Automatisms are sequences of unintentional, repetitive behavioral movements, where the isolated single movement may seem intentional but where the repetition is inadequate and abnormal. They differ from primary motor phenomena by typically being more complex [6,13]. Most likely because of their complexity, they are more difficult to evaluate by inspection only. Based on seizure description by eye witnesses (n=176) and a smaller group of patients who underwent EEG-video monitoring (n=76), only few seizures could be localized reliably on clinical grounds [16]. There was no significant difference between FLE and TLE for “simple” automatisms, but oral automatisms were more common in TLE than in FLE [16]. Oral and manual automatisms were more frequent in TLE, whereas bicycling automatisms were more common in FLE [17]. An earlier study of our group corroborated these findings by showing that the semiological differences between automotor and hyperkinetic seizures [18] are reflected in quantitative movement parameters [12]. We believe that these comparisons of clinical judgment and automated analysis should be used in future studies to allow putting the automated results into clinical context. 4.2 Relation of automatisms to total seizure duration Seizure duration is one of the few quantitative parameters addressed by former studies showing longer total seizure duration in TLE than in FLE as was the case in our study [8,19]. However, this could not be shown when based mostly on seizure description [16]. A more detailed analysis of seizure duration in our data shows that the percentage of seizure time spent with ULAs was significantly shorter in TLE than in FLE (Table 1). This may reflect the observation that seizures arising from the temporal lobe are frequently characterized by motionless staring at seizure onset, and automatisms occur later in the course of the seizure [20,21]. 4.3 Asymmetry of automatisms in TLE Quantitative analysis demonstrates significant asymmetry of the automatisms: within the group of seizures of patients with TLE, ipsilateral ULAs are faster and tend to cover more distance than the contralateral ULAs (Table 1, Supplementary video 1). In contrast, this was not the case in patients with FLE (Supplementary video 2). There are several studies on the asymmetry of ictal automatisms during epileptic seizures. However, their lateralizing significance has been controversial. While early publications [22] could not find any reliable lateralizing value in ipsilateral automatisms, some studies reported that unilateral hand automatisms lateralize significantly to an ipsilateral seizure onset temporal lobe [23–25]. Furthermore, contralateral dystonic hand/arm posturing has a better lateralizing value than ipsilateral automatisms alone resulting in a positive predictive value of up to 92% [2,26,27]. The combination of ipsilateral hand automatisms and contralateral dystonic posturing was found only in mesial TLE and not in neocortical TLE [27]. These previous studies relied on qualitative observer visual analysis. However, qualitative analysis of seizure semiology is subject to poor interobserver reliability [8]. Evaluation of tonic hand posturing, head version, and immobile limb in temporal and extratemporal epilepsies demonstrated that only contralateral hand dystonia in TLE had a good interobserver reliability [8]. We previously demonstrated in a quantitative movement analysis of patients with TLE that the duration of ipsilateral automatisms was longer than that of the contralateral automatisms with regard to the total seizure duration [15]. The movement extent and speed, however, were not different in this small patient group [15]. The results of the present study, showing a significantly reduced movement extent of ULAs on the contralateral side in patients with TLE, may be related to a combination of tonic or dystonic hand posturing and what has been labeled “immobile limb” in its extreme clinical expression [28]. It is known that ictal ULAs frequently begin bilaterally, and in the course of the seizures, automatisms persist ipsilaterally, while contralaterally, dystonic or tonic posturing develops or that limb just stays immobile [2,25,27]. In our seizure-free subgroup, the asymmetry differences were not significant, most likely because of the smaller sample size. Quantitative analysis demonstrates significant asymmetry of the automatisms: within the group of seizures of patients with TLE, ipsilateral ULAs are faster and tend to cover more distance than the contralateral ULAs (Table 1, Supplementary video 1). In contrast, this was not the case in patients with FLE (Supplementary video 2). There are several studies on the asymmetry of ictal automatisms during epileptic seizures.

In our seizure-free subgroup, the asymmetry differences were not significant, most likely because of the smaller sample size. 4.4 Limitations of 2D movement analysis and future perspectives The technical setup used in this study can be used in any epilepsy monitoring unit because it can be applied to standard 2D video recordings. We have used infrared reflectors mounted on the patient, which allow a higher level of automation [10]. Nevertheless, the two-dimensional analysis and limited video resolution of our study have technical limitations. We could, for example, not evaluate oral and digital movements, which are common in TLE [21,29,30] and may provide even more localizing value. Despite this limitation, we could find significant differences in the ULAs at the level of the wrist between FLE and TLE. This also reflects the clinical observation that limb movements in FLE are typically faster and wider involving the proximal joints (hyperkinetic) [17,19]. The motion analysis as used in this study requires, in part, manual marking and manual analysis, making the application in routine presurgical work-up too labor intensive. We are currently developing marker-free 3D movement analysis systems that acquire and analyze movements without manual marking or patient-attached reflectors [31]. These systems will use the parameters and cut off levels from this study and will enable their use in everyday practice. The 3D analysis will also allow even more detailed analysis, with less restriction in, for example, the acquisition plane as described in the Methods section. Future developments of quantitative movement analysis may also allow seizure detection when, for example, the repetitive movement parameters of seizures characterized by automatisms are used to calibrate ambulatory motion analysis devices. This principle of application has been demonstrated for the detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures [32]. That quantitative approach of movement analysis should be expanded to other seizure types, which will require more detailed analysis of the ictal movements such as manual and oral automatisms. Additionally, though, the results from these technical analyses should be compared with clinical judgment or be compared in well-defined syndromes to avoid statistically significant results that lack clinical relevance. 5 Conclusion Our study of ULAs shows that quantitative movement analysis provides clinically relevant objective localizing and lateralizing information in patients with TLE and FLE that is useful in the presurgical evaluation of patients considered for resective epilepsy surgery. Further studies should use a three-dimensional approach to overcome the limitations of the two-dimensional method. The following are the supplementary data related to this article. Supplementary video 1 Video of ULAs quantification of a TLE patient. 2D trajectories are displayed with a 1sec delay to better visualize the movement. Note the repetitive left wrist trajectory and the immobile right limb which characterize many TLE ULAs. Supplementary video 2 Video of ULAs quantification of a FLE patient. 2D trajectories are displayed with a 1sec delay to better visualize the movement. The seizure was recorded during the night using an infrared light sensitive camera. The visible bright spots are infra-red reflective markers which were used to better track the patient's body movements. Some reference markers, located on the bedsides are also visible. Note the proximal limb movements which lack rhythmicity and characterize many FLE ULAs. Supplementary material Table 1 Data of patients with TLE.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a widely used mechanism that can support such forms of compositions as it allows heterogeneous systems to be wrapped as services that can then be combined with each other. However, current SOA orchestration languages require writing scripts that are typically too low-level for end users to write, being targeted at professional programmers and business analysts. To address this problem, this paper proposes a composition approach based on an end user specification style called SCORE. SCORE is an architectural style that uses high-level constructs that can be tailored for different domains and automatically translated into executable constructs by tool support. We demonstrate the use of SCORE in two domains - dynamic network analysis and neuroscience, where users are intelligence analysts and neuroscientists respectively, who use the architectural style based vocabulary in SCORE as a basis of their domain-specific compositions that can be formally analyzed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

DroidJacket is based on Android mobile devices and provides data aggregation, processing, visualization and optionally relaying services. The DroidJacket design is plugin oriented, integrating analysis modules, namely an online ECG plugin for both real time pulse and arrhythmia detection. © 2011 IEEE.",

Our solution relies on in-bore video setup with 2 cameras mounted in a 90 degrees angle that allows tracking movments while acquiring fMRI sequences. In this study we show that using 3D motion quantification of a simple finger opposition paradigm we were able to map two different finger positions to two different BOLD response patterns in a typical block design protocol. The motion information was also used to adjust the block design to the actual motion start and stop improving the time accuracy of the analysis. These results reinforce the role of video based motion quantification in fMRI analysis as an independent regressor that allows new findings not discernable when using traditional block designs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

However many different parameters are actually used to analyze the CT perfusion results, trying to integrate the temporal information it contains. Some of these parameters are Blood Volume, Blood Flow or Transit Time for example.

However, because of its limited time resolution (about one volume every 3 seconds), integration with a high temporal resolution method (Electroencephalography (EEG)) has shown to be promising. Two main artifacts rise on the EEG in this setup: The imaging artifact and the Ballistocardiogram artifact (BCG). The focus of this paper is to present a new approach for BCG removal. The most common method for its removal is based on average wave shape subtraction. This method assumes a deterministic approach to the BCG, which, as every analog biomedical signal, is not a good assumption. In this paper we present and evaluate, for the first time, a Ballistocardiogram removal adaptive algorithm based on dynamic time warping (DTW)[1]. Although for stable pulse this method can slightly distort the wave shape, we believe it can be reliable to deal with greater BCG time variations, like in the presence of arrhythmia, or during emotion stimulation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",

The use of a similar approach in fMRI, now adapted for 3D time series, is both appealing and new. Such time series analysis imposes challenging requirements regarding computational power and medical image management. In this paper we propose a grid architecture framework to support the typical analysis protocol of association analysis applied to fMRI.

        "doc_abstract": "Recent investigations suggest that there are differences between the characteristics of EEG and MEG epileptiform spikes. The authors performed an objective characterization of the morphology of epileptiform spikes recorded simultaneously in both EEG and MEG to determine whether they present the same morphologic characteristics. Based on a stepwise approach, the authors performed a computer analysis of EEG and MEG of a set of coincident epileptiform transients selected by a senior clinical neurophysiologist in recordings of three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A computer-based algorithm was applied to extract parameters that could be used to describe quantitatively the morphology of the transients, followed by a statistical comparison over the extracted metrics of the EEG and MEG waveforms. EEG and MEG coincident events were statistically different with respect to several morphologic characteristics, such as duration, sharpness, and shape. The differences found appear to be a consequence of MEG signals not being influenced by volume propagation through the tissues with different conductivities that surround the brain, compared with EEG, and of the different orientation of the underlying dipolar sources. The results indicate that visual inspection of MEG spikes and automatic spike-detector algorithms should use criteria adapted to the specific characteristics of the MEG, and not simply those used on conventional EEG.",

        "doc_abstract": "In Epilepsy, seizure semiology analysis is routinely used for diagnostic purpose. The behavior of the patient during seizures is usually evaluated by expert qualitative observation where several signs are identified. In the clinical literature, several ictal phenomena are described but still involved in controversy. In this paper, we present our effort to establish a quantified movement analysis method to be widely used as an additional tool to clarify this controversy.",
