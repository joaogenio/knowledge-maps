Agriculture is one of the oldest activities, but its evolution has not kept up with human needs. In order to increase production and ensure its sustainability, it is necessary to move towards precision agriculture. This work will explore some of the latest developments in the area of network and sensor information and was motivated by the interests shown by a consortium that includes Globaltronic, Quinta do Crasto and Altice Labs in improving the existing weather stations to assist the irrigation process since this demands the precise knowledge of the amount of water that is to be supplied to the plants. To achieve this, we need to use reliable measuring systems for water but also for the number of chemical agents, like fertilizers, that contribute to the growth of the plants, but impacts also to the pollution of rivers and water supplies.",

Equipment failures can be very costly and have catastrophic consequences. In its basic concept, Predictive maintenance allows minimizing equipment faults or service disruptions, presenting promising cost savings. This paper presents a data-driven approach, based on multiple-instance learning, to predict malfunctions in End-of-Line Testing Systems through the extraction of operational logs, which, while not designed to predict failures, contains valid information regarding their operational mode over time. For the case study performed, a real-life dataset was used containing thousands of log messages, collected in a real automotive industry environment. The insights gained from mining this type of data will be shared in this paper, highlighting the main challenges and benefits, as well as good recommendations, and best practices for the appropriate usage of machine learning techniques and analytics tools that can be implemented in similar industrial environments.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Intelligent agriculture in general, but especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous, requires a large number of sensors in order to obtain an effective control and thus increase productivity. This need becomes more evident in vineyards on the farms of the demarcated Douro region due to the specificities of the territory and the vineyards themselves. Thus, it is necessary to have low cost sensors which are, essentially, easy to install and maintain. In the present work, a node with these characteristics was developed, which, in addition, is low consumption and communicates wirelessly through a Long Rang Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) network. To obtain an easy installation, a library of clusters was created for the LoRaWAN network and dedicated to sensors used in agriculture, especially those using an asynchronous serial protocol for intelligent sensors. Three nodes were developed and tested with sensors used in agriculture to measure several environmental parameters (soil and air temperature; wind speed, gust and direction; soil water content, water tension and electrical conductivity; solar radiation; precipitation; atmospheric and vapor pressure; relative humidity; and lightning strikes count). The three nodes send data to a server through an existing gateway on the farm. The data are decoded and sent to an Internet-of-Things analytics platform where it is aggregated, viewed and analyzed. Samples of the data collected are presented. The developed nodes are of small dimensions (85 × 65 × 35 mm), thus making them easy to handle and install. Energy consumption depends on the distance to the gateway, and the number and type of sensors connected to each node. In the implemented cases, the maximum consumption was ≈400 µA. The development of a cluster based library makes the node plug-and-play. The developed nodes will be a great step forward for the use of wireless sensors in smart agriculture in Douro vineyards.",

At this point, we have collected data regarding the level of dependency of the elderly, and the risk of development of pressure ulcers, so that we can adapt the sensors according to their need. For example, sensors installed in a bed can warn the caregiver that it is time to change the position of the elderly patient.

This paper proposes a method of classifying breathing sounds using CNN, where it is trained and tested. To do this, a visual representation of each audio sample was made that allows identifying resources for classification, using the same techniques used to classify images with high precision.For this we used the technique known as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). For each audio file in the dataset, we extracted resources with MFCC which means we have an image representation for each audio sample. The method proposed in this article obtained results above 74%, in the classification of respiratory sounds used in the four classes available in the database used (Normal, crackles, wheezes, Both).",

All rights reserved.Accessibility and inclusiveness of people with disabilities is a recurring theme that is already perceived as an issue in the field of human rights. Ramps, elevators, among other devices aim at the inclusion of these individuals with limited mobility. Various types of motor limitations, specially partial limitations, are linked to corresponding physical-motor rehabilitation process, with the purpose of reducing or eliminating the patient’s dependence on a caregiver or devices for adaptation. Patients with motor disabilities must practice physiotherapeutical exercises along a physician in order to perform body and muscle analysis to ensure the patient’s well-being. To reach a more accurate analysis, physiotherapists use a range of devices to acquire patient data, such as the spirometer, to acquire the patient’s breath intensity and lung capacity. Similarly, there are other technologies capable of acquiring motion data and quantifying them. This work aims to develop a system that, paired together with an exercise game project (exergame), can acquire and transmit the motion data acquired in-game for an easier and faster analysis of the patient’s growth, relying on graphs, tables, and other visual indicators to improve the evaluation of physiotherapeutic treatments. The usage together with an exergame also has benefits such as increased patient compliance with the treatment and improvements in well-being.",

While there are treatments to reduce the impact of the impairment on the patient's life, they can be either very costly or be alternative methods that are not directly aimed at rehabilitation purposes, such as the usage of Kinect Adventures to make the patient perform favorable poses and stretching limbs to help the undergoing treatment. Even though a low-cost device, the Kinect can acquire valuable data and make the patient perform exercises. However, a more direct and targeted approach might achieve better results with a game aimed for them. To attend to the many forms and variations of motor impairments, a starting point may be necessary for the development of exergames that fulfill the needs of each patient and impairment. The result is a low-cost base project that can be easily used, created using only online free tools while giving the developer creative freedom and a properly aimed solution to the patients.",

Longevity often leads to increased dependence and the need for continued care, whichis often left to informal caregivers given the inability of the elderly care network to provide. The informal care provided to the dependent elderly occurs either at the caregiver’s or the elderly person’s home. Technology application in healthcare has been attracting the attention of engineers for a long time, especially in providing support for health recovery and maintaining therapy practices. Due to major advances in technology, particularly in movement capture optic systems and information extraction through digital image analysis, support systems are being created to monitorhow therapeutic plans are carried out, as well as to evaluate people’s physical recovery or to assist healthcare professionals and informal caregiver to provide care for dependent elders. This paper reports on the accomplishments of a project with the general objective of using information and communication technologies to develop a prototype for a system focused on monitoring and assisting the execution of a therapeutic plan integrating physical mobilization and medication.",

This is due to the fact, among several other reasons, the increase of the volume of images coming from several sources. Digital images have been used for a variety of purposes, from the storage of souvenirs to accurate medical exams. However, Images may be corrupted due to several factors. The challenge of suppression or noise attenuation has led to the search for improved techniques in order to preserve important characteristics of the image, but, on the other hand, there is no solution available to completely solve the problem, boosting the production of the work proposed here. In this paper proposes a method for noise attenuation in computed tomography images using a hybrid genetic algorithm, the proposed method seeks to optimize the results in the space of solutions composed by a series of techniques of noise filtering. At the end the proposed method is compared statistically with two other competing methods and after the resulting filtered images are shown.",

This chapter addresses this type of problem by presenting recent advances in error concealment methods, expanding conventional techniques used for 2D video to multiview (MVC) and multiview video-plus-depth (MVD) coded formats. The methods described in the chapter exploit the specific characteristics of multiview formats to achieve highly efficient error concealment performance and, consequently, to improve the perceptual quality delivered to end users, in the presence of transmission losses. In the case of MVC, besides spatial and inter-frame, inter-view correlations are also exploited, while in MVD, the most efficient methods use both the texture (view) and depth information to improve the error concealment performance. The most relevant contributions in this field are described in detail, where the performance of these advanced solutions is discussed along with comparisons between different methods and benchmarking.",

Either high or low priority is assigned to each packet according to the relevance of its payload (voice segment) for the voice intelligibility. Then, in case of constrained networking conditions, by discarding first the voice packets of lower importance, the network always delivers those segments that most contribute to the perceptual quality. The proposed method is based on a dynamic programming optimisation algorithm that finds the optimal subset of m high priority voice segments in each utterance of size n > m. Such optimal subset minimizes the reconstruction distortion over all possible subsets with the same size m (i.e., the distortion incurred by a utterance reconstructed from only m segments). The simulation results show that the proposed method consistently achieves higher mean opinion scores (MOS) in comparison with non-selective packet drop under the same random network loss conditions, yielding better quality of experience (QoE) for the same packet loss rates (PLR). The priority classification algorithm is independent from error concealment methods and distortion metrics used in the optimisation process, which allows generalisation for diverse communication networks and applications.",

The study of the kinematics of the human body involves several methods that resort to the analysis of several parameters that come from the movement. Important parameters to take into account are the acceleration, velocity and position (linear or angular) of the various articulations of the human body, which can be measured by sensors or through the analysis of repeated images obtained by camera. In this paper will be presented a suit that acquire the different position of human joints that will be useful in rehabilitation, FatoXtract.

Ltd.The Portuguese Micromouse Contest®* is an innovated robotic contest in Portugal that address the need to enhance student interest and performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, while fostering skills that are important prerequisites for IT careers. To facilitate the access to younger students a robot kit and an Arduino library was developed and made available on GitHub. Some of the library examples include the common algorithms used to solve mazes, like the Flood Fill, Right or Left Wall Following to name a few. Recursive Backtracking algorithm is often used to solve mazes especially if there is a lot of computer power. This is not the case of the Arduino platform that only has 2.5 KB of SRAM and a clock speed of 16 MHz, so implementing Recursive Backtracking becomes quite difficult. In this work we show how to implement Recursive Backtracking to find if there are better solutions for solving the maze. We also show the memory measurements for three Arduino common platforms the Leonardo, the UNO and the DUE.",

A contribution to an efficient solution for voice packet prioritization is proposed in this paper, using an Arduino platform to implement a dynamic programming algorithm that is capable of finding the most important voice segments to convey in the payload of high-priority VoIP packets. Despite the fairly high complexity of the algorithm versus the limited computational resources of Arduino, the efficient implementation developed in this work demonstrates that the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of voice signals is consistently improved when losses are primarily affecting the least important segments. The paper also discusses technological aspects relate to the choice of the Arduino DUE platform rather than UNO, MEGA, ZERO or 101 boards.",

Thus efficient methods to recover corrupted depth data are critical functions for accurate view rendering. This paper proposes an error concealment method for intra-coded depth maps, based on spatial intra and inter-view methods, which exploit neighbouring data of depth and colour images received error-free. A novel three-stage processing algorithm is devised to reconstruct sharp depth transitions (i.e. lost depth contours), using a disparity map and geometric interpolation based on parametric Bézier curves. The simulation results obtained from different views of various MVD sequences, for different packetisation modes and a wide range of packet loss rates (PLR), show that the proposed method consistently leads to quality improvement of synthesised images in comparison with reference methods.",

The novel aspects of the proposed method rely on the use of geometric transforms and warping vectors, capable of capturing complex motion and view-dependent deformations, which are not efficiently handled by traditional motion and/or disparity compensation methods. By exploiting the geometric nature of depth information, a region matching approach combined with depth contour reconstruction is devised to achieve accurate interpolation of arbitrary shapes within lost regions of depth maps. The simulation results show that, for different packet loss rates, up to 20%, the depth maps recovered by the proposed method produce virtual views with better quality than existing methods based on motion information and spatial interpolation. An average PSNR gain of 1.48 dB is obtained in virtual views synthesised from depth maps using the proposed method.",

Instituto de Telecomunicações Campus 2 IPLeiria/ESTG 2401-911 Leiria Portugal This paper addresses depth data recovery in multiview video-plus-depth communications affected by transmission errors and/or packet loss. The novel aspects of the proposed method rely on the use of geometric transforms and warping vectors, capable of capturing complex motion and view-dependent deformations, which are not efficiently handled by traditional motion and/or disparity compensation methods. By exploiting the geometric nature of depth information, a region matching approach combined with depth contour reconstruction is devised to achieve accurate interpolation of arbitrary shapes within lost regions of depth maps. The simulation results show that, for different packet loss rates, up to 20%, the depth maps recovered by the proposed method produce virtual views with better quality than existing methods based on motion information and spatial interpolation. An average PSNR gain of 1.48dB is obtained in virtual views synthesised from depth maps using the proposed method. Keywords Multiview video-plus-depth Depth map reconstruction Depth loss Error concealment Geometric transforms 1 Introduction Visual communications services and applications are expected to expand in different fields of the consumer market and also in different professional areas. In this context of rapid evolution, the use of flexible visual representation formats, such as the multiview video-plus-depth, is undoubtedly an important driving factor behind the progress of multimedia technology. Besides entertainment, several other application fields are benefiting from 3D images and video, such as medical, engineering, training and education. As a consequence of this evolution, compressed 3D and multiview visual content is expected to be a major contributor to the overall multimedia traffic delivered through future media networks. Nowadays, there are two main types of coded representations of 3D and multiview image and video content: multiview video coding (MVC) and multiview video-plus-depth (MVD) [1,2]. In MVC, several different views of the same scene are encoded together. In MVD, each texture image is associated with a corresponding depth map, which is used to synthesise intermediate virtual views for multiview rendering or stereo rendering. In regard to communications, it is known that the impact of transmission errors or data loss is greater in 3D image and video communications than in traditional 2D communications, because the perceived quality of experience (QoE) is highly sensitive to a wider variety of quality factors [3,4]. Therefore, careful design of error concealment algorithms for 3D image and video decoders is essential to minimise the strong effects of data loss in the perceived quality of 3D video. This is particularly true in the case of MVD format, where the integrity of depth maps plays a crucial role in the accuracy of view-synthesis, with great impact on the perceived quality of the resulting virtual views. Hence, the efficiency of error concealment algorithms specifically tailored for depth maps is a critical performance factor in 3D video communications [5,6]. It is known that depth discontinuities (i.e., edges in depth maps) convey important perceptual information that must be preserved regardless the type of processing involved. This is also taken into account in synthesis of high resolution images from lower resolutions [7]. In the case of 3D video, edges of depth map correspond to the boundaries of visual objects located at different distances from the viewer. Therefore, preserving sharp edges in depth maps is an important requirement when these are affected by distortion, such as coding distortion, transmission errors or data loss. However, it is worthwhile to note that a depth map with lower distortion does not necessarily leads to higher quality synthesised images. For instance, in [8] several depth maps were compressed with different encoders and the authors concluded that coding depth maps with higher PSNR does not guarantee that the corresponding synthesised views present better subjective quality than those obtained using lower quality depth maps. The authors used H.264/AVC Intra coding and Platelet-based coding for depth maps and concluded that H.264/AVC Intra achieves significantly higher RD performance than Platelet-based coding. However, synthesised images using Platelet-based coded depth maps present better quality than those obtained from H.264/AVC Intra-coded depth maps. The reason for such results is the better capability of Platelet coding to preserve the quality of edges in comparison to H.264/AVC. In this paper we propose a method to reconstruct lost depth data in multiview video communications, where transmission errors or packet loss may occur. The novelty of the proposed method relies on exploiting both inter-view and inter-frame correlation, using a region matching algorithm based on geometric transforms and temporal information to efficiently reconstruct lost regions in depth maps. Furthermore, spatial error concealment is also used as a complementary technique to recover regions where accurate region matching is not achieved. In this case, the geometric features of the depth map (i.e., edges) are first recovered followed by a weighted spatial interpolation. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the related work and Section 3 describes the region matching with geometric transforms technique used in the proposed method. Section 4 describes the proposed depth reconstruction method and Section 5 presents the simulation results. Finally Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related work In the recent past, error concealment for 3D and multiview video has been a research topic of interest for both academia and related industry. Different approaches have been proposed for different representation formats, either stereo, video-plus-depth or multiview video, with or without associated depth (i.e., MVC, MVD). As mentioned before, this paper deals with MVC and MVD. In the case of MVC, some solutions proposed in the past are based the MVC prediction structure of the hybrid H.264/AVC, which includes known error resilient tools like Flexible Macroblock Ordering(FMO) and motion compensation techniques [9,10]. Other methods presented in [11,12], basically rely on temporal information to recover lost data. In [13–15], besides using temporal information, interview correlation is also used for the same purpose. In general, these type of algorithms are able to achieve good results in multiview video, but they do not consider depth information, thus their application to MVD is very limited. In [16–18] some methods are also proposed for error concealment of stereo and multiview, but without using any specific algorithm for depth maps. Early work dealing with loss of depth data was presented in [19,20], where temporal and spatial correlations were used to recover lost depth, in both the texture images and depth maps. In [21,22], error concealment methods for video-plus-depth are proposed, also relying on temporal information, but without considering errors in intra-coded frames. In these works depth contours are not preserved and some blocking artefacts are noticeable in reconstructed depth maps, which leads to inaccurate synthesis and quality degradation of virtual views. In [23] the authors assume that in presence of depth map errors, the corresponding texture image region is free of errors, then it can be used for the depth map recovery. A different approach was followed more recently in [24], where the authors use a fuzzy algorithm. Although good objective results are reported in most of these works, the impact of depth map reconstruction on the quality of the synthesised views is not evaluated, which does not allow a direct comparison with the proposed method. Most of the referenced methods mainly rely on translational motion or linear object displacement in different views, which is not always true. Besides these cases, the proposed method is capable of handling objects’ shape deformations, in both the temporal and inter-view dimensions. The geometric transforms expand current methods to efficiently recover lost regions in depth maps under complex motion (e.g. rotations) and non-trivial camera arrangements (e.g., circular). 3 Region Matching with Geometric Transforms (RMGT) The method proposed to recover lost regions in depth maps relies on the structural similarities between the texture views and the depth maps. The novel characteristic of this method is the ability to find additional common features, between regions of different frames or views, to be incorporated in the loss concealment method. To this extent, a region matching algorithm is devised to model complex motion between two images or to calculate geometric transformations between views acquired by non-linear camera arrangements. Such geometric transformations are used to match regions from different frames, which would not be possible using a straightforward block matching procedure, allowing to recover the lost depth areas more efficiently. This type of warping techniques are also for different kinds of applications, such as the case presented in [25], where geometric transforms are used to characterise human facial expression. Regarding motion characterisation techniques, typical block matching is represented by a simple translation of a rectangular block, in region matching with geometric transforms (RMGT) an image block is warped to achieve the best possible representation of a complex motion or disparity, by means of a geometric mapping (see Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 represents an example of a quadrilateral that is warped from one view to another (forward mapping). The parameters of the geometric transformation are computed by solving a system of equations that relates the block corners (vertex points) P 0 , P 1 , P 2 , P 3 from one quadrilateral to another. Each point of the quadrilateral P 0 … P 3 is moved within a search window to minimise the distortion between values of the reference quadrilateral in View N and the warped quadrilateral in View N - 1 . Considering Fig. 1, where a N × N square block ( u , v plane) is mapped onto an arbitrary quadrilateral ( x , y plane), the corners are defined by the set of Eq. (1): (1) ( u , v ) = ( x , y ) ( 0 , 0 ) = ( x 0 , y 0 ) ( N , 0 ) = ( x 1 , y 1 ) ( N , N ) = ( x 2 , y 2 ) ( 0 , N ) = ( x 3 , y 3 ) Among the perspective transforms that may represent this type of geometric transformation, the Bilinear transformation has been chosen, not only due to its computational simplicity, but also by its ability to represent non-translational motion, such as rotations [26]. A Bilinear mapping is represented by Eq. (2): (2) [ x , y ] = [ uv , v , u , 1 ] a 3 b 3 a 2 b 2 a 1 b 1 a 0 b 0 Eqs. (3) and (4) are used in order to determine the coordinates X and Y of a certain mapped values with bilinear interpolation: (3) X ( u , v ) = a 0 + a 1 u + a 2 v + a 3 uv (4) Y ( u , v ) = b 0 + b 1 u + b 2 v + b 3 uv Solving the previous equations (Eqs. (1), (3) and (4)) in regard to coefficients a k , k ∊ [ 0 , 3 ] , the following set of Eq. (5) is determined, for a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 : (5) a 0 = x 0 a 1 = x 1 - x 0 N a 2 = x 3 - x 0 N a 3 = x 2 - x 3 - x 1 + x 0 N 2 Replacing the coefficients a k in Eqs. (3) and (4), the coordinates X and Y of the mapped values are represented respectively by Eqs. (6) and (7): (6) X ( u ′ , v ′ ) = x 0 + x 1 - x 0 N u ′ + x 3 - x 0 N v ′ + x 1 - x 3 - x 1 + x 0 N 2 u ′ v ′ (7) Y ( u ′ , v ′ ) = y 0 + y 1 - y 0 N u ′ + y 3 - y 0 N v ′ + y 1 - y 3 - y 1 + y 0 N 2 u ′ v ′ Since the coordinates X and Y are not integer values, it is not possible do obtain directly the mapped pixel or depth value, onto an equispaced pixel grid, thus, it is necessary to interpolate the mapped values. This is computed through bilinear interpolation, using the intensity of the four nearest neighbour values. Fig. 2 shows an example where a mapped value P ( u ′ , v ′ ) is interpolated using the four nearest values P a , P b , P c and P d values. p x and p y are, respectively, the horizontal and vertical distance between P and P a , where values p x and p y belong the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . The point P at location ( u ′ , v ′ ) is defined by Eq. (8): (8) P = ( P b - P a ) p x + ( P d - P a ) p y + ( P c - P d - P b + P a ) p x p y + P a After computing all values of the mapped quadrilateral, the distortion between the mapped quadrilateral and the reference block is evaluated using the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) as given by Eq. (9). (9) SAD = ∑ y = 0 N - 1 ∑ x = 0 N - 1 ( | p M ( x , y ) - p r ( x , y ) | ) where N is the block size, p M is the mapped quadrilateral and p r is the reference block. 3.1 Fast search with RMGT In practical multiview video the disparity between two views is not higher than a certain maximum value w (e.g. w = 64 pixel), then the motion vectors norm are in general limited by such upper bound. For an object displacement between two images of w pixels, the maximum number of search points (mappings) m for each corner of the quadrilateral is given by Eq. (10): (10) m = ( 2 w + 1 ) 2 Since the four vertices of the quadrilateral are displaced to all possible positions within the maximum range defined by w, the total number of search points (M →mappings) is given by Eq. (11). (11) M = m 4 = ( 2 w + 1 ) 8 For instance, if w = 64 , then full search with RMGT may perform up to 7.67 × 10 16 quadrilateral mappings. For each mapping it is required to compute the SAD between the mapped values and the reference block (see Eq. (9)). Therefore, finding the best match for each combination using full search with RMGT is computationally complex and not practical. To achieve reduced computational complexity, a fast search algorithm was devised, comprising two steps. Firstly, typical block matching with full search is used, where a square block of pixels is compared to another block of the same size. This initial search is done inside the limits of a search window, allowing to find the translational motion component. The second step is a refinement process, where the corners of the quadrilateral are displaced after the initial block matching, but not performing full search. The search method is based on the Diamond search, similar to the one proposed in [27]. In each corner of the quadrilateral, a diamond with nine points is positioned (see Fig. 3 ), and each corner of the quadrilateral is displaced to the diamond positions. In the first iteration (see Fig. 3a), the nine point diamond allows to 9 4 mappings, covering a search window of six pixels. In the second iteration, the diamond grid is centred on the best position of the previous iteration (see Fig. 3b). The search process stops when ever a search window boundary is reached (SD), or due to an early termination condition. This condition takes effect when the SAD of a mapped quadrilateral is not lower than the previous iteration. 4 Error concealment method for depth maps in MVD The concealment method proposed in this paper is specifically tailored for depth maps in MVD, where at least two views exist along with the associated depth maps. This work deals with the case where depth maps associated with one view are possibly affected by transmission errors, assuming that the corresponding losses are not synchronised with the corresponding regions of their counterparts. This method is structured in four stages, as shown in Fig. 4 . Firstly, the contours of the depth map recovered by inter-view RMGT are extracted to be used in the intensity compensation process described in Section 4.2. Secondly, the coding type used for the depth map under concealment is determined by inference from the GOP structure. In case of Inter coding, motion compensation is performed in Stage 1 using motion information from the corresponding texture image, and the associated residue to validate motion accuracy. Then if the depth map is not fully recovered after Stage 1, the concealment process proceeds to Stage 2, where the remaining lost depth values are reconstructed using Inter-view and Inter-frame geometric transformations, based on RGMT. For each missing value, two candidates are determined, i.e., one from Inter-view and another from Intra-view, and then the best one is selected based on a boundary matching analysis. If the lost region of the depth map is still not fully recovered, a Spatial Depth reconstruction method is further performed in Stage 4. In case of Intra coded depth maps, the concealment process begins at Stage 3, where only Inter-view techniques are used, since motion information is not available in Intra-coded depth maps. After Stage 3, if the depth map is not fully recovered, the remaining depth values are processed at Stage 4. This algorithm is able to recover both isolated lost regions (e.g. slices) in depth maps and full frame depth losses. When a full depth maps is lost, Spatial Depth recovery cannot be performed and Concealment using residual and motion from texture (Section 4.1), Inter-view (Section 4.2) and Inter-frame (Section 4.3) techniques are used. 4.1 Concealment using motion from texture As shown in the algorithmic structure o Fig. 4, when the depth map to be recovered is inter-coded, its reconstruction is done at Stage 1 by using motion information from the corresponding texture image. For example, in [28] the authors use a similar method for macroblock classification, based on residual information. This approach is based on the evidence that texture motion information is highly correlated with that of the depth maps [19]. Thus, such information is used to perform motion compensation in corrupted depth maps to reconstruct the missing regions. However, not all motion information available in the texture is useful for such purpose, because some motion vectors (MV) may not be accurate enough. Thus, a MV selection criterion is used, based on the texture residual information, where only texture MVs associated with null residue are selected. A MV v k associated with a texture block p k ( n , m ) is considered accurate enough if the residue coefficients r k ( n , m ) are zero, i.e., R k = ∑ n , m | r n , m | = 0 . This approach only uses MVs with high accuracy to reconstruct lost depth in order to minimise the error propagation, which does not occur when all MVs are used, regardless the existence of residual information. The remaining lost depth areas, that are not reconstructed due to the lack of accurate MVs, are reconstructed in the following stages, as shown in Fig. 4. 4.2 Inter-view concealment with RMGT Inter-view reconstruction with RMGT is used in Stage 2 and Stage 4, comprising the following three steps: Step 1: The co-located region of the lost depth area (see Fig. 5 ) in the associated texture image ( View N ) is used as starting search point and used as a reference block for RMGT, to search for the best match in the corresponding quadrilateral of the texture image View N - 1 . The RMGT search is performed using the fast method described in Section 3.1. For the translational block matching, the search window is defined by SW, whilst for the RMGT this is defined by SD. Both SW and SD are predefined parameters, which can be changed according to the estimated disparity in the content. Step 2: This step is responsible for refining the result of the previous one, taking the best match found in the texture image View N - 1 to recover the lost area from View N using depth values from View N - 1 . This is accomplished by warping the quadrilateral area until finding the best possible match for the lost region, using the method described in Section 3.1. The mapped depth values are the candidates to fill the missing area in the lost region. The best match is validated after evaluating the distortion between some depth values: the mapped candidate block (in View N - 1 ) and non-corrupted depth values in the neighbourhood of the lost area (in View N ). Three rows (top and bottom neighbour values) and three columns (left and right neighbour values) of depth values are used to measure such matching distortion between the candidate block and the surrounding area of the region to be recovered. In case of error bursts only top and bottom neighbour values are used, as the left and right neighbours are unavailable. The distortion is measured as the SAD and a pre-defined threshold (th), defined as th = kp ∗ N pel , is used to decide whether the mapped values from View N - 1 are suitable to recover the lost region of View N . N pel is the number of depth neighbour values used to compute SAD and the constant kp may be empirically obtained. If the computed distortion (i.e., SAD) corresponding to the best quadrilateral used to recover the lost depth region is larger than th, then the block is discarded and RMGT is not used to recover the lost region. Step 3: After depth reconstruction in Step 2, an intensity compensation of these depth values is performed. Due to the displacement between both cameras, the intensity of the depth map values used to recover the lost area from one view to another may be different, which may also cause some blurry effect. The intensity compensation process, not only compensates the intensity of depth map values but also has the ability of homogenising the reconstructed region. Depth intensity compensation is done by taking into account the contour information within the recovered region. Fig. 6 shows an example of how the intensity correction is performed on the Recovered Block of View N . The intensity correction is done by adding Δ to the depth value P ( n , m ) being compensated. The Δ value is a weighted average of the differences between the four nearest neighbour depth values in the recovered depth map ( View N ) and the corresponding values in the reference depth map ( View N - 1 in this case), as shown in Eq. (12). This method also considers the region edges by using only neighbour depth values belonging to the same side of an edge crossing the region. (12) P ( n , m ) = P ( n , m ) + Δ where Δ is defined by Eq. (13): (13) Δ = ∑ i = 1 4 ( D i - C i ) · d i ∑ i = 1 4 d i The coordinates of P ( n , m ) are n and m , d i are the distances between the value P ( n , m ) and neighbour depth values D i of the lost region ( ViewN ). C i are the neighbour depth values of the candidate region in View N - 1 . In the example illustrated in Fig. 6, the interpolated value P ( n , m ) belongs to a region (Depth Contour) and the outside neighbour values above the contour cannot be considered in this case. Thus, the differences between D 1 , C 1 and D 4 , C 4 are not used, then weight d 1 = 0 and d 4 = 0 . If C i and D i are not available to compute Δ , because all depth values are located outside the region delimited by the extracted contour, then intensity compensation is not performed. This procedure avoids blurry effects because the depth values located on one side of the contour do not contribute for the reconstruction of those from the other side. 4.3 Inter-frame concealment with RMGT The proposed Inter-frame concealment method uses a similar technique to the one described in Section 4.2. The main difference relies on the depth information used to recover the lost regions. In this case, such information is retrieved from a previously decoded depth map of the same view. The motion information is gathered not only from uncorrupted neighbouring regions of a temporally close depth map, but also from the texture image of the same view. Depending on the type of coded region to be recovered, either from a P or B-frame, there are MVs pointing to past or future frames, previously decoded and stored in the decoder reference lists. The MVs obtained from the texture and depth are then selected as follows: • Using MVs from texture regions co-located with the depth lost area, three different MVs are computed ( MV T ( i ) ), as defined by Eq. (14), where V x T ( i ) and V y T ( i ) are the horizontal and vertical components of MV T ( i ) , respectively. (14) MV T ( i ) = V x T ( i ) , V y T ( i ) , i ∈ { min , max , mean } The index i identifies MV i T according to its magnitude, either the minimum, maximum or average of the MVs in region co-located with the lost area in the texture image. • If the MVs of the neighbouring regions of the missing depth are available, then they are also taken into account to compute twelve different MVs ( MV D ( i , j ) ), as defined by Eq. (15). V x D ( i , j ) and V y D ( i , j ) are the horizontal and vertical components of MV D ( i , j ) . i ∈ { min , max , mean } correspond to the minimum, maximum and average magnitude, respectively, of the MVs located at the top, bottom, left and right of the missing depth region, defined by j ∈ { Top , Bot , Left , Right } . (15) MV ( i , j ) D = ( V x D ( i , j ) , V y D ( i , j ) ) , i ∈ { min , max , mean } , j ∈ { Top , Bot , Left , Right } ; Each of these 15 MVs (three computed from texture image and twelve from depth map) are used to define the start searching point of the quadrilateral for RMGT, which is similar to the second step described in Section 4.2. Each MV will lead to a candidate block of depth values Dc k , where Dc k has the same size of the missing block to be reconstructed ( k ∈ { 1 , 2 … , 15 } ). After computing and storing all Dc k in their respective buffers, the best Dc k to reconstruct the lost region is chosen by minimising the respective SAD at the boundaries between the candidate block and the location of the region to be recovered. The minimum SAD value defines the best candidate D ∗ c k , but if the SAD is greater than a threshold (th), then the Dcand k block is discarded and RMGT is not used to recover the lost region. In the presence of large missing depth areas, due to error bursts or full frame losses, the neighbouring depth information is not considered reliable for refining the matching region. When more than 50% of the recovered neighbouring region is also lost, the inter-frame error concealment described in this subsection is not performed. In such cases, only inter-view error concealment is performed, as described at the beginning of this section. 4.4 Spatial depth recovery The remaining depth areas that were not concealed in Stage 2 and Stage 3, are processed using a Spatial Error Concealment method at Stage 4. In this method lost depth values are interpolated using the non-corrupted neighbour values and others recovered in the previous stages. The depth contours are reconstructed based on the edge information of the texture image. Details of this spatial depth interpolation can be found in previous work [29] of the authors. 5 Simulation results and discussion 5.1 Experimental setup The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a diverse dataset of MVD video sequences, with two views and corresponding depth maps. Five sequences with different characteristics, namely spatial resolution and different types of objects in the 3D scene were used: Ballet, Book Arrival, Break Dancers and Champagne are composed by natural scenes and only sequence Dancer and Shark are digitally created (see Table 1 ). The application scenario of these simulations corresponds to multiview video-plus-depth delivery over hybrid broadcast networks, where the texture views are transmitted over the broadcast infrastructure, whilst the depth stream is transmitted over an IP network [30]. Whilst the texture over the broadcast network is transmitted with high error protection and not likely to suffer losses due to transmission errors or other type of problems such as congestion, jitter and excessive delay, the depth stream is delivered through a shared network with lower error protection, where packet loss is likely to occur. To simulate this scenario, the texture images and the corresponding depth maps used in the simulations were encoded independently with H.264/AVC at fixed QP=28, using the reference software JM17 [31]. The IDR period was set to 12 frames and the Group Of Pictures (GOP) structure is IBPBP using 2 reference frames. The reference software View Synthesis Reference Software (VSRS 3.5) [32] from the MPEG Group was used to synthesise the virtual views using the various depth maps under evaluation. The contours of colour images and depth map that are necessary for the proposed method were obtained with the Canny algorithm using the OpenCV 2.1 implementation [33]. The low ( th low ) and high ( th high ) thresholds for the Canny algorithm were computed based on the mean luminance of either the processed texture frame or depth map, th low = 0.5 ∗ mean and th high = 1.5 ∗ mean , respectively. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm a packet loss simulated environment was defined. Three packetization modes were used, which result in different error patterns when a packet is lost. For Packetization Mode 1 (PM-1), FMO explicit mode was used with eight slices per depth map defining a dispersed chess pattern with square blocks of 64pixel. In Packetization Mode 2 (PM-2), slice mode was used and each depth map was divided into slices with height of 64pixel and the same width as the texture images. In Packetization Mode 3 (PM-3), each depth frame corresponds to a single packet, resulting in full frame losses whenever any packet is lost. Depending on the size of each coded slice, each packet may contain several slices with an upper limit of 1200bytes per packet. In order to increase resiliency and reduce long error bursts, interleaved packetization was used in order to disperse the packet losses throughout the entire GOP. Packet loss in the depth sequences was simulated using the Gilbert-Elliot model for different average packet loss ratios (PLR) and burst sizes [34]. Four packet loss rates were tested: 2%, 5%, 10% and 20%. Since the packet loss patterns are random, for each sequence ten runs were performed. Three error concealment methods were used to reconstruct the lost depth based on previous works, which are used as references to compare and validate the performance of the proposed method: Ref. 1 This is a spatial concealment method. Based on bilinear interpolation without taking into account any edges in depth maps. In the case of entire frame loss, spatial concealment cannot be used. Ref. 2 In this method, the texture motion vectors are used to conceal the depth maps through motion compensation, similarly to the method implemented in [19]. Ref. 3 In this reference method, the lost depth maps regions or entire depth maps are concealed using “Frame copy” method, as in H.264/AVC reference decoder JM17 [31]. 5.2 Results and discussion The objective quality (average PSNR for each sequence) is compared between the synthesised virtual views, using depth maps reconstructed with the reference methods (Ref. 1, Ref. 2 and Ref. 3), and the proposed one, as shown in Table 2 . The difference between the PSNR obtained from the synthesised view using the error-free depth map (i.e. column 0%) and that obtained from those synthesised from reconstructed depth maps is also shown for all methods: Δ Ref1, Δ Ref2, Δ Ref3 and the proposed method ( Δ Prop). The lower this difference, the better the quality. Using the PSNR differences, an objective comparison between the proposed method and the reference ones is also shown in columns: Δ Prop_Ref1, Δ Prop_Ref2, Δ Prop_Ref3. The higher this difference, the better is the proposed method, when compared with the reference ones. When large depth regions are lost, the reference methods tend to not perform efficiently, often resulting in poor error concealment. Depending on the spatial location of the errors, the negative effects of inaccurate concealed depth regions can propagate throughout the GOP. These simulation results show that the proposed method is able to outperform the reference methods, especially in sequences where the depth maps contain many objects and large movements. This is because lost regions are recovered with better accuracy, preserving the depth discontinuities, which are of major importance to achieve high quality in the synthesised images. In smooth areas, Ref. 1 is able to recover the lost areas with good accuracy, as can be seen in the good results achieved for sequences Dancer and Break Dancers. Since Ref. 2 uses MVs from the corresponding texture image, its performance is highly dependent on MV accuracy, because texture motion is not always perfectly correlated with depth motion. Both Ref. 2 and Ref. 3 show good performance in low motion sequences because previously decoded frames provide perfect motion vector candidates for depth maps. For example, sequence Champagne presents low motion activity between frames, therefore all methods not based on spatial concealment perform quite well. Ref. 2 is also particularly efficient for sequence Dancer, where the depth maps are mainly composed of smooth areas with a single moving object in the scene, i.e. the dancer. In most frames of the sequence, this dancer does not present a very complex motion, therefore the MV extracted from texture are quite accurate, which is an advantage for both Ref. 2 and for the proposed method. This good performance is represented by small PSNR differences, not achieved for other sequences. In the most-case scenarios, for packetization 2 with 20% PLR the quality of the synthesised views obtained by the proposed method is higher than that achieved by the best reference method, up to 1.48dB (Breakdancers). This performance is consistent for different types of sequences and different reference methods. Under certain circumstances, some reference methods are also able to recover the depth maps with good accuracy. But, when the characteristics of the image change (homogeneity of the depth, motion, etc.) the quality of the recovered depth maps tends to decrease. In such conditions the proposed method is still consistently better than its counterparts. When comparing digitally created depth maps, with others that were created from natural scenes, the latter are more prone to noise and imperfections. Depth maps computed for synthetic content, usually have shapes that are represented more accurately, which implies that their contours are also more accurate, resulting in a superior error concealment performance of the proposed method. This can be observed in the Shark sequence, which was digitally created and has a diverse and large number of well defined shapes along the sequence. These objective results can be subjectively confirmed in Figs. 8 and 9 , where some synthesised images and their associated depth maps are shown. The example of Fig. 8 shows a region detail of the original depth map (Fig. 8a), the corrupted depth map with a 10% PLR (Fig. 8b), depth map recovered with the reference methods (Fig. 8c–e), and a depth map recovered with the proposed method (Fig. 8f). The bottom images of Fig. 8 show the corresponding synthesised views using the original depth map (Fig. 8g), the depth maps concealed with the reference methods (Fig. 8h–j), and the synthesised views using the proposed method (Fig. 8k). These details clearly show the type of artifacts in synthesised views caused by an inaccurate recovered depth. In Fig. 8 one can observe the importance of recovering depth maps with high accuracy. The detailed regions show that in presence of large depth variations, the proposed method is able to reconstruct the lost regions with very good quality. In the presence of thin objects in the image, like in the case of the legs of the ballerina, the proposed method also achieves good performance because it is able to efficiently match the boundaries of the candidate block with the undamaged neighbours. When observing the results obtained for Packetization 2, the proposed method again achieves good results, even in large lost areas, such as entire depth frames. Another example is presented in Fig. 9 using Packetization mode 1 with the Dance sequence. Observing the corrupted and recovered depth maps as well as the resulting synthesized images, one can confirm that the proposed method is able to consistently achieve accurate results. Fig. 7 shows a PSNR plot for Shark (Fig. 7a) and Breakdancers (Fig. 7b) sequences, where the objective quality of each synthesised view using the concealed depth maps can be seen. We can observe that the quality of the concealed frames is almost always higher then the reference methods. The quality of synthesised views can reach PSNR gains of up to 2dB in the case of Shark sequence. For some frames of Breakdancers, the equivalent gain can be as high as 3dB. 5.3 Computational complexity The complexity burden is an important issue in error concealment methods because they increase the computational resource requirements of decoders and energy consumption. The method presented in this paper was investigated to achieve the best performance in terms of reconstruction quality of the video signal, without considering computational complexity. Therefore, further work towards fast implementations of the proposed method is required, in order to reach real-time operation in practical decoders. Considering the current implementation of the proposed error concealment method, without algorithmic optimisation, the simulations take few seconds to run the error concealment procedure in the case of PLR=20%. Since the algorithmic nature of RMGT is similar to that of motion estimation in video coding, this function is considered the major contributor for the additional computational complexity in the proposed method. Therefore, a rough estimation of the overall complexity is that a robust decoder implementing the proposed method has approximately the same complexity as a standard encoder. Nevertheless, although the current implementation is not compliant with real-time requirements, it is structured in such a way that it can be readily implemented in modular processing systems, e.g., FPGA, multi-core platforms. The RMGT algorithm relies on a set of operations that are easily parallelised to achieve fast implementations in many generic multimedia-enabled platforms. As an example related to motion estimation, one may refer to the work presented in [35] where several motion estimation designs are discussed for real-time applications. 6 Conclusion This article presented an efficient error concealment algorithm for reconstruction of lost depth data in MVD, which takes into account the geometric information of both depth and texture to recover the missing regions. The proposed method shows that even when large depth areas are corrupted, i.e. full frame losses, it is possible to achieve good concealment efficiency. This is due also to the use of Inter-view and Inter-frame warping vectors from geometric transforms together with texture motion information. Additionally, depth areas can still be spatially reconstructed with high efficiency by first recovering the most significant edges in the depth map, using texture image information from the same view of the corrupted depth map. It was found that higher objective quality is obtained for all synthesised view sequences, using depth maps reconstructed with the proposed method. This method is implemented as a post-processing scheme, do not depending on any particular coding algorithm. This makes it a promising candidate for implementation in MVD video decoders connected to error-prone networks.

But can the future be crafted without the past? We believe that many past inventions crave the future, so their understanding is a bridge of knowledge that must be passed to students. According to Grand View Research website the microcontroller market will rise from the 20 billion units in 2015 to an amazing 39 billion units in 2020. Therefore, an increase on IT careers is also expected. The Morse code and the telegraph revolutionized long-distance communication in the past and laid the groundwork for the communications revolution. In fact, although developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse (1791-1872) and other inventors, only in 1844 the first telegraph message, from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland, was sent. To provide the means to students to start learning this technology we have developed four experiences that introduce them to the fundamentals of communications, including the Li-Fi technology. This new technology is based on the Morse code, and can spark again the communications revolution by using tiny, imperceptible flickering lights can provide a new way of sending data to computers and mobile devices. Therefore, we decided to revitalize the almost forgotten Morse code by implementing it with an Arduino in order to lay again the foundations to this new revolution that is coming. This paper presents the implementation model of two Morse code translators, how they work, their implementation, and some results. We also present a VLC (Visible Light Communication) system based on the same principles of the Morse code building this way the foundation for students to proceed with this course of the investigation.",

Despite the fact that MDC allows decoding of any description even when the others are lost in the multipath network, the resulting coarsely decoded depth maps produce unacceptable distortion in synthesised views. This is particularly harmful in the case of intra-coded depth slices because of subsequent error propagation. To achieve improved quality in the virtual views synthesised from MDC depth maps received with lost descriptions, a method is proposed based on the depth geometric information extracted from the received descriptions and also from texture motion. Accurate recovery of either lost or coarsely decoded depth slices from one single description, is achieved by jointly using motion information, depth map edges and spatially neighbouring depth values. Comparing with MDC decoding without enhanced reconstruction of lost descriptions, the proposed method reaches quality gains up to 2.29dB for loss rates of 10%.",

Although Arduino is generally used for small applications for the artistic and maker community, its built-in Analog to digital converter can be used for sound capturing, processing and reproduction. Equipped with a powerful AVR 8 bit RISC microcontroller, the Arduino, can achieve up to 200kHz with a 10 bit resolution according to the Atmel ATmega328P datasheet that is the AVR core that we are going to focus on this article. Realizing the hardware potential, software suppliers like Matworks or National instruments, have included the Arduino packages on the software accessories of MATLAB and LABView. This work presents some of the sound capabilities and specific limitations of the Arduino platform, enfacing its connection and installation with MATLAB software. A series of examples of the Arduino interface with MATLAB are detail and shown in order to facilitate users initiation of MATLAB and Arduino Digital Sound Processing enhancing education fostering.",

The research deals with the problem of decoding corrupted depth maps received from error-prone networks, where the quality of the reconstructed depth data is not always directly related to the quality of the virtual views synthesised by those maps. Even after error concealment such distortions are not particularly perceived as other known types, such as coding distortion. Thus, traditional quality metrics are not adequate to capture all the relevant features. In this work, the performance of two error concealment methods for depth maps is evaluated using a perceptually-aware objective metric. This metric is validated through subjective assessment of virtual views synthesised with concealed depth maps. Each subjective test is performed by comparing the relative quality between between two synthesised images using different error concealment methods. The perceptual impact of reconstruction in corrupted depth of MVD is evaluated under various loss rates, using several colour images and depth maps encoded at multiple quantisation steps. The achieved results reveal that the proposed objective quality metric is mostly inline with user preferences, in respect to the relative performance of each error concealment method.",

Despite the competition from ANT+, ZigBee, Nike+, NFC and RF4CE, in 2010 the Bluetooth SIG (special interest groups) adopted a new wireless technology named Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE coexist with Bluetooth in the same chip (called dual mode) therefore assuring this technology a rapid growth among smartphones, iOS, tablets, laptops and PCs. In fact, Bluetooth SIG also announced that it shall be hard to find a smartphone or tablet-PC that does not integrate BLE in the near future. Despite this accelerated growth, BLE shares the same band with Wi-Fi and all other low power technologies, so in order to achieve QoS, a mandatory requirement in many systems, tests for interference and coexistence must be performed. This study analysis the impact of a BLE sensor network on a crowded 2.4GHz room, with multiple Wi-Fi routers, ZigBee sensors and Bluetooth technology. We also compare the results with the ones obtained inside an anechoic chamber on similar experiences.",

Whenever a single description is lost, the remaining ones are still able to provide a coarsely decoded version of the depth map. While in multiple description video, such coarse decoding is still acceptable for display, in the case of depth maps the additional decoding distortion propagates through the corresponding view synthesis. The proposed method is capable of enhancing low quality depth maps decoded from one single description, based on geometric information available in coarsely decoded slices, combined with higher quality depth values in adjacent slices decoded from both descriptions. In comparison with existing MDC decoders, the enhancement method achieves quality gains in synthesised views up to 1.69dB for packet loss rates of 10%. © 2014 IEEE.",

Diabetes Mellitus has become the most common chronic diseases in nearly all countries, and continues to increase in numbers and significance, as economic development and urbanization lead to changing lifestyles characterized by reduced physical activity, and increased obesity. Recent advances in wireless sensor networking technology have led to the development of low cost, low power, multifunctional sensor nodes that enable environment sensing together with data processing.

Besides the consolidation of acquired theoretical knowledge, the tool allows its users to apply three error patterns geometry to the signals and test minimum dimension and maximum dimension signal reconstruction algorithms. In the specific case of minimum dimension problems it can be solved using different solvers, iterative and direct linear equations methods. The developed tool allows the problem conditioning analysis through the spectral radius of the system matrix, the condition number and others parameters available in some specific methods. This feature gives the possibility to alter the problem definitions to the desired goal before the reconstruction begins and to choose the optimal method, depending on each problem constraints The time unit that measures the algorithms performance is expressed in terms of one Fourier Transform (FFT) calculation time. In this way the data is presented not in an absolute way but in a relative measure independent from the machine's architecture. © 2013 IEEE.",

In this chapter, the authors address the most relevant methods used to evaluate the voice quality in the communications context of modern enterprises, where VoIP is used as an emerging technology with impact in their activity. Relevant factors for service providers and enterprises using VoIP technology are described, such as those related to the measurement of intelligibility and with impact on the overall voice communications quality. In addition, the most important voice quality evaluation methods recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are presented in this chapter, along with the main features that can be used to improve voice communications. Fundamental concepts behind voice quality evaluation models are highlighted, such as intrusive, non-intrusive, objective, subjective, and parametric methods. After addressing the most relevant theoretical and methodological aspects, a recent application of voice quality monitoring for VoIP communications is described as the result of a research and development project. After its successful implementation, this monitoring system is now fully operational and integrated in voice quality assessment equipment currently in the market.",

Despite the benefits of precision agriculture and precision viticulture production systems, its rate of adoption in the Portuguese Douro Demarcated Region remains low. We believe that one way to raise it is to address challenging real-world problems whose solution offers a clear benefit to the viticulturist. For example, one of the most demanding tasks in wine making is harvesting. Even for humans, the environment makes grape detection difficult, especially when the grapes and leaves have a similar color, which is generally the case for white grapes. In this paper, we propose a system for the detection and location, in the natural environment, of bunches of grapes in color images. This system is able to distinguish between white and red grapes, and at the same time, it calculates the location of the bunch stem. The system achieved 97% and 91% correct classifications for red and white grapes, respectively. Keywords Grape detection Visual inspection Precision viticulture Image processing 1 Introduction Variable management practices within the field according to site-specific conditions can be promoted through the concept of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Precision Viticulture (PV). It is based on new tools and information sources provided by modern technologies, such as yield monitoring devices, soil, plant and pest sensors and remote sensing [3]. PA and PV generally have two main objectives: to render the production more cost-effective and to reduce its environmental impact. The first objective can be achieved by reducing production costs and improving productivity. The second objective relates to the accuracy and the ability to control the application of production factors, such as chemicals, which should be done within a fair measure of the real needs of crops. The rate of adoption of these technological tools varies considerably from country to country, and from region to region [23]. In addition to environmental benefits, such as those related to better water and nutrient management, PA and PV systems can increase worker productivity, augment product throughput and improve selection reliability and uniformity. Additionally, the use of robotic systems in agriculture has seen a sharp increment in recent years. Many systems have been described for the automation of various harvesting processes, such as for fruit location, detachment and transfer, among other, [22]. They have been used in the harvesting of, for example, melons [11], cucumbers [12], tomatoes [16] and oranges [18]. For a survey of several aspects of these systems see, for example, [14] and [20]. According to the report of the US Department of Energy [1], the wine industry is interested in using autonomous robotic systems for grape harvesting, phytosanitary treatments, among other very time and human resources consuming tasks, for multiple reasons; this also happens to be true for the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) of Portugal, as explained below. Harvesting conditions, in particular, affect wine quality, and several techniques need to be used in order to produce quality wines, and including scheduling details [2], and ending up with production details [15]. Soft computing methods and techniques have been used in virtually all fields of science. They have been successfully applied to the detection of lifetime building thermal insulation failures [21], neural visualization of network traffic data for intrusion detection [8], identification of typical meteorological days [6], enhanced data visualization [7], to name only a few. Visual inspection methods can also be used to locate grapes for harvesting. Unfortunately, the location process is much easier for fruits than for vine grapes (see, for example, [19]), even if soft computing techniques like the ones listed above are used. The environment makes grape detection difficult even for humans, especially when the grapes and leafs have similar colors, as is the case for white grapes. To an automatic recognition application, the grapes can appear at different scales, they can be partially hidden by leafs, the luminance of images can vary widely due to the sun, clouds, leafs, and so on. We have tried different pattern recognition techniques in order to try to solve these problems. Many works have been devoted to the definition of object invariant descriptors for simple geometric transformations; see, for example, [13]. The Zernike moments [5] have been developed to overcome the major drawbacks of regular geometrical moments regarding noise effects and image quantization error. Zernike moments were successfully used in the detection of red grapes [4], but nothing is known about their performance in connection with white grapes. Moreover, besides the difficulties associated with the calculation of the Zernike moments, the method proposed by [4] implies two distinct phases, training and recognition, the training phase being crucial to the results of the whole system. The computation time for the learning step, for 17 images, is reported to take 5 minutes on a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4. The computation time for the recognition step (identification of each block of size 16 × 16 pixels) takes less than one second. We have tried to use Zernike moments to detect white grapes but the results were disappointing (less than 50% of correct classifications). In this paper we present a simple method for the detection and location, in natural environment, of bunches of grapes in color images, using only very simple and basic image processing techniques. The system is able to distinguish between white and red grapes, and also to work at night (with very little, or none, light/brightness variation). Additionally, the system can calculate the location of the bunch stem, which can be used to help guiding a harvesting robot. The system presented here represents part of an effort that is being made by our team to help introducing PA and PV in the farmersʼ everyday practices in the DDR [17], and is intended to be used in an autonomous harvesting robotic system. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present the DDR unique characteristics, which definitely shaped and constrained the system. Section 3 is used to present the proposed system. Its performance and efficiency are discussed in Section 4, where experimental results obtained with real images are given. Section 5 presents some conclusions and discusses future work. 2 The DDR unique characteristics and their impact on the system The DDR is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the oldest Wine Demarcated Region of the World, where Port wine is actually produced and then shipped to the city of Oporto. Due to its unique characteristics, it poses very specific challenges, mainly connected with its topographic profile, pronounced climatic variations and complex soil characteristics. It is located in northeast Portugal, and consists mostly of steep hills (slopes reaching 15%) and narrow valleys that flatten out into plateaux above 400 m. The Douro river dug deeply into the mountains to form its bed, and the dominant element of the landscape are the vineyards, planted in terraces fashioned from the steep rocky slopes and supported by hundreds of kilometers of drystone wall. Vineyards in the DDR are characterized by their small area size, and by having more than one caste per parcel and even for bard, particularly in the case of old vines. The more recent vines were projected and organized having in mind better control of the number and type of castes. Still, more than 120 (both white and red grapes) different castes are used in the region. Grape harvest and disease predictions, as well as the assessment of the grape value, are currently left to the grape-growers, without the help of decision-support mechanisms, in an environment where no significant irrigation systems exist. Traditionally, vineyards have been harvested by humans. However, harvesting is a hard work, particularly in a region with the topographic and climatic characteristics of the DDR. The manpower needs are large and it is more and more difficult to find qualified workers. Autonomous systems could not only reduce the harvesting cost and manpower needs but they could also be conceived to work during the night. There is however one important constraint: although it is not essential that the workpower of the harvesting robot surpasses that of a human, it is crucial that they satisfy quality control levels at least similar to those achieved by humans. Also, the existing machines harvest grapes by striking the vine, a process that is not recommended for some wines, such as champagne, for chemical reasons (e.g., oxidation) but also because of some deposits being collected with the grapes. These harvesting machines need, at least, one operator. They also require previous preparation of the vineyard, such as cutting the tips. By contrast, the system presented in this paper is intended to be used in an autonomous robotic system, without previous preparation of the vineyard, which helps to keep the cost of the solution down to a minimum. It is part of an effort made by our team to help introducing or spreading PA and PV in the farmersʼ everyday practices in the DDR [9,17]. We wanted a system able to work during the night, with very little, or none, light/brightness variation. We also wanted the system to distinguish red from white grapes, because in the DDR red and white grapes are commonly found in the same parcel and even the same bard, and therefore telling one from the other is essential for correct harvesting. 3 The grape recognition system We came to realize early in our work that if we could solve the problem of detecting bunches of white grapes we could also solve the problem of detecting red grapes. The reasons will become clear from the results section. Consequently, we have focused our efforts on the detection of bunches of white grapes. For the reasons explained in the previous section, we wanted the whole system to be able to work at night (i.e., in the darkness, with very little, or none, light/brightness variations), and also have the ability to distinguish between red and white grapes. To this end, the system simply makes a first pass through the original (night captured) image, counting the number of pixels that are “inside” limits of the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) components of ( 044 , 051 , 064 ), ( 033 , 041 , 054 ), ( 055 , 062 , 075 ), and ( 018 , 024 , 036 ), for red grapes, and ( 102 , 108 , 089 ), ( 095 , 104 , 085 ), ( 076 , 090 , 078 ), and ( 083 , 089 , 038 ) for white grapes. These four central values (colors) were experimentally (trial and error) determined during the development phase. The system looks for pixels within the “limits” of these central values: the default limit contains all the values within 8% of these central values for red grapes and 15% for white grapes (these were the values experimentally determined from the night captured images). The largest counts indicate the type of grape, i.e., red or white. However, if initial conditions are known, i.e., if we know that a parcel consists of a single type of grape (say white), then the system can be switched to that type of grape mode (say white mode), skipping the grape identification phase. Most vineyards in the DDR have small areas, and, as said before, they may also contain more than one type of grape (red or white and even different castes) per parcel and even per bard, particularly in the case of old vines. Once the type of grape (red or white) is established, the system follows three additional steps: color mapping, morphological dilation, black areas and stem detection. The color mapping step is done based on the conditions established during the grape identification step. At the end of this step we will have a binary image (black for the pixels in the range and white for the other pixels). Fig. 1 (a) shows the original image, containing bunches of red grapes, and Fig. 1(b) presents the resulting image of the application of color mapping step. The resulting image from this step does not generally have a uniform (continuous) black region, see Fig. 1(b), but several regions, where the concentration of black pixels is greater. The morphological dilation operation is meant to fill in the gaps between the pixels, yielding uniform black regions. We have used a square of 3 × 3 pixels as the structuring element, typically one of the most simple and used structuring elements. We should recall that the shape of this structuring element is not very far from the shape of a grape berry. Because the regions resulting from the color mapping step when applied to red grapes and white grapes are very different, with a greater sparsity when dealing with white grapes, we have typically used 60 iterations of the morphological dilation for red grapes, and 100 iterations for white grapes. Fig. 2 (a) shows the resulting image after the dilation operation, applied to the image presented in Fig. 1(b). Obviously, we have tried different sizes for the structuring element, but when its size was increased, even with a lower number of morphological dilation iterations, the number of overlapping uniform black regions tends to increase; these overlaps will correspond to incorrect overlapping bunches, leading to incorrect identifications. The final step is used to detect and numbering the black regions, and locate the bunch stem. First, the number of contiguous regions are counted and labeled (numbered) using 8-connectivity. Then, for each region, its width, height and area are calculated (in pixels) so that we can discard false detections of very small bunches or very large regions to contain only one bunch of grapes. Note that in this last case the region will be composed of two or more bunches and the system will need to capture more images (from different angles) to correctly handle these situations. Now, these parameters, and also the total number of admissible areas, are all adjustable. Next, we count the number of regions, center, area, width, height, perimeter and boundaries, for each region. For each region, and based on the pixel distribution and density around its center, it is determined the “horizontal” (width) and “vertical” (height) axes of the bunch, i.e., the bunch orientation. Then, with these axes (and orientation), and with the regionʼs limits, we locate the bunch stem. Fig. 2(b) shows the resulting image after the final step and Fig. 3 shows another example consisting of the original image and the resulting identification. 4 Results and discussion All images presented here and used to test the system were captured during the night, with a Panasonic FZ28 camera simply using its internal flash, i.e., no other lightning system was used. By capturing the images during the night we avoid any spurious reflections or bad illumination during sunny day time, like momentary presence of clouds, but also, as explained above, some important wine chemical properties (e.g., oxidation). In total, there were 190 images containing bunches of white grapes, and 35 images of red grapes (the number of images containing bunches white grapes is much higher than that of red grapes because the identification of bunches of red grapes is much simpler, as explained above). A summary of the results can be seen in Table 1 . As we can see, there were 172 correct results for bunches of white grapes; this means that all bunches present in each of these 172 images were correctly identified. We emphasize this fact, because we want that in a near future this system can be part of a harvesting robot, and we know that most of the infield images captured by this robot could contain more than one bunch per image, which clearly is not an optimal situation, but rather real. Recall that in a practical infield situation the robot can take as many images as needed to ensure that no more bunches are present for harvesting. However, we also have 18 images with incorrect or false detections. This means that the system classified some areas of the image as if they were bunches although no bunches at all were present, or missed the identification of an existing bunch. Also, if two regions were merged during the morphological dilation process they were counted as an “incorrect” result. As we have foreseen, the systemʼs performance, in percentage, is better for bunches of red grapes than for white grapes. Recall that the color of red grapes is very different (contrasting) from their surroundings (e.g., color of the leaves); however one must note the small number of red grape sample images. The system can also be used to help guiding the robot. As it can be seen in Fig. 4 , although the picture was captured very far way form the grape bunches the system manages to identify the presence of bunches of grapes. So, the system can help to tell the robot to move along that direction, adjusting (fine tuning) its position or trajectory. Usually, the presence of many bunches of grapes in one image indicates that the robot is at a considerably far distance from those bunches. Obviously, this can only be a contribution to the robotʼs trajectories or positioning. In the examples of Figs. 5 and 6 , for example, we can see that the bunch in the center of the figure is correctly identified. However, we can see that there are more bunches to be harvested. By capturing one more image after the harvesting of the central bunch the system will detect the presence of more bunches and then correct the robots trajectory, as in the previous situation. As noted before, the presence of leaves may (partially) occlude a bunch; in these cases a mechanic system like the one presented in [10], basically a blower/fan to remove leaves, can be used to help solve this problem. We have tested the system on a computer running Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, with an Intel Core Duo Processor T2300 at 1.66 GHz, Mobile Intel 945 PM Express Chipset, 3 GB DDR2 667 MHz SDRAM, and NVDIA GeForce Go 7300 External 128 MB VRAM video card. In order to reduce the identification time, we tested several image resolutions, as presented in Table 2 . With a resolution of 1.3 megapixel (MP) the system is able to produce the same results as with a 10 megapixel resolution. Note that the identification of bunches of red grapes takes less time, because it uses a lower number of iterations during the dilation operation step. 5 Conclusions and ongoing work Within the context of precision agriculture/viticulture, and because the Douro Demarcated Region has its own very particular characteristics, a vision inspection system was developed in order to identify bunches of grapes, for later inclusion in a robotic system for night conditions harvesting. The system is also able to automatically distinguish between white and red grapes, and has achieved 97% and 91% of correct classifications, for red and white grapes, respectively. Additionally, it can also calculate the location of the bunch stem, and can be used to help the robotʼs location and guiding system. Concerning the identification algorithm we are trying to make it more flexible. For example, during the morphological dilation step, the number of iterations should depend on the merging of the different regions, i.e., the iteration process should stop if the regions are already contiguous or if two distinct regions are merged. Also, the tilling and distribution of these contiguous regions should be analyzed in order to prevent incorrect identifications, like two or more staked regions, regions with much greater width than wight, among other. Obviously, a dedicated (specific) lighting system may help in producing better identification results (starting with a simple diffuser), but it would also increase the system cost and needed resources (e.g., power supply). We are also currently testing multi-spectral cameras. This solution is far more expensive, but it could bring information about grapes maturation and alcoholic level. A cheaper alternative may include infra-red cameras, but red grapes yield more thermal information than white grapes, and so, once again, the identification of red grapes seems simpler than white grapes. In addition to the tasks of detection and harvesting, the robotic system may also contribute to mitigate the environmental impact of chemical plant protection products, as its application by robotic systems would be made only at points of interest identified by the vision system, among other possible applications (pruning, trimming the vines, disease detection, etc.).

        "doc_abstract": "A low technological corn cob particleboard has been under research by this research team. It intends to be affordable and sustainable. So far, some of its assessed material properties (e.g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required for most of the above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3 cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e.g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e.g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose). The obtained results indicate that the proposed product may also have an interesting acoustic behaviour for building purposes. This conclusion is even more interesting taking into account that corn cob is a natural, organic, renewable and local raw building material. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Highlights ► Study of a new low technological corn cob particleboard. ► Sustainable building solution. ► Natural materials recycling and reuse. ► Innovative sustainable material for non-structural applications. ► Potential impact sound insulation sustainable solution. A low technological corn cob particleboard has been under research by this research team. It intends to be affordable and sustainable. So far, some of its assessed material properties (e.g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required for most of the above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e.g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e.g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose). The obtained results indicate that the proposed product may also have an interesting acoustic behaviour for building purposes. This conclusion is even more interesting taking into account that corn cob is a natural, organic, renewable and local raw building material. Keywords Corn cob Particleboard Impact sound insulation Agricultural waste materials Sustainability 1 Introduction Affordability, low rate of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and small energy and water consumptions are some parameters that have to be taken into consideration when a product is designed. Using green building materials which must be renewable, local and abundant is a solution that contributes to achieve these important goals. In this context, several authors [1–5] have already proposed using different agricultural products such as bagasse, cereal, straw, corn stalk, corn cob, cotton stalks, kenaf, rice husks, rice, straw, sunflower hulls and stalks, banana stalks, coconut coir, bamboo, durian peel, oil palm leaves among others for product processing such as particleboard, hardboard and fibre board, and focusing on their thermal insulation ability. Other authors have been studying the technical potential of using other types of residue such as newspaper [6], honeycomb [7] or polymeric wastes [8] in the processing of different building components. On the other hand, new alternative sustainable sound insulation building products have been at the centre of society’s concerns. Sound insulation products processed with natural materials (e.g. cotton, cellulose, hemp, wool, clay, jute, sisal, kenaf, feather or coco) or processed with recycled materials (e.g. wood, canvas, foam, bottle, jeans, rubber, polyester, acrylic, fibreglass, carpet or cork) are some solutions already established [9–13]. These green products or eco-products intend to be sustainable alternative to the traditional ones (e.g. glass or rock wool). The fact that natural fibres may be economic, light weight and environmentally friendly, justifies that they have been studied as an alternative to the synthetic fibres in the acoustic context [14]. Among the above identified agricultural products, corn cob has an additional advantage in terms of possible application for alternative processed products because it does not collide with the worldwide food stock and it is generally considered as agricultural waste. Recent research works [15–23] have given particular emphasis to the application of corn cob in the industry. In the Portuguese agricultural context, the recent figures [24] indicate that there is a decreasing tendency of the corn plantation intensity in the last years. However, this activity is still relevant in the Portuguese agricultural panorama. Corn is mainly cultivated in the north and centre parts of mainland Portugal. Corn and corn stalk have different uses but the corn cob itself is in general treated as agricultural waste which it is necessary to burn. Unfortunately, this option does not contribute to a better environmentally friendly world. Finding fields in which it may possible to use corn cob can help solve this problem and also stimulate small industrial activities using low technology methods which may contribute simultaneously to the social and economical development of certain interior regions of the north of Portugal. The building industry is one of those fields in which the corn cob can have an important role as an alternative sustainable building material. Furthermore, a set of ancient Portuguese buildings located in the north of Portugal were recently reported to present corn cobs in their external walls [15]. Contrasting with the Portuguese situation, the amount of corn produced per year has been increasing in countries such as USA, China and Brazil [23], which results in huge amount of corn cob. These facts have inspired us to study a corn cob particleboard that may be a sustainable and affordable alternative product which may be applied in different building applications such as a thermal insulation product, an acoustic insulation product, a light partition wall, a ceiling coating, and as indoor doors, among others. In these possible building applications, the sound insulation performance of the corn cob particleboard is relevant and therefore it is important to evaluate its acoustic ability. Therefore, the main objective of this paper consists precisely in giving the first step in this context by evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the corn cob particleboard that is still under research. This paper is structured as follows: firstly, the corn cob particleboard is briefly put into context and the corn cob particleboard sample preparation used is emphasized; secondly, some specific aspects related to the impact sound insulation tests performed in this research work are indicated, which include a detailed description of the adopted facility, the identification of the main equipments used and the description of the setup. A necessary adopted experimental procedure simplification is also indicated in this section; thirdly, the obtained experimental results are presented and discussed. The impact sound insulation gain of using the corn cob panel is numerically quantified. A comparative analysis between this panel and the most commonly applied sound insulation products in the building industry in Portugal, in terms of impact sound insulation gain, is also done in this section; finally, the main conclusions of this research work are drawn. 2 Context As it was mentioned earlier a corn cob particleboard has been under research by this team in order to assess it as a possible alternative sustainable solution for different building applications. Previously, the microstructure and the elementary chemical composition of the corn cob were identified in [15] by performing a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analysis. Its alveolar microstructure type and elementary chemical composition were found to be similar to the extruded polystyrene (XPS) or cork. These results have inspired us to think about a possible affordable and sustainable corn cob particleboard solution as an alternative to the previously reported ones [16–18]. Therefore, a simple manufacturing process consisting in binding corn cob particles with wood glue according to the ratio of 1:4 (glue: corn cob particles), in terms of weight, is proposed here. This process includes four main stages which are, respectively, and in order: the mixing up of the components (i.e. corn cob particles and wood glue), moulding, curing (which is natural) and unmoulding. The resulting corn cob particleboard has been tested and, so far, some of the obtained properties such as density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance, and its sustainability performance suggest adequacy of this product for the above identified building applications in an environmentally friendly way. For instance, in [19] a valuable thermal insulation performance of the corn cob particleboard under research was verified. Corn cob particleboard samples sized 3cm×100cm×50cm (thickness×width×height), Fig. 1 , were processed specifically for the impact sound insulation tests and according to the manufacturing process described above. The curing occurred under controlled thermo and hygrometric conditions (i.e. laboratory conditions). The samples were pressed during this stage. The corn cob particleboard samples presented an average density of 334kg/m3 (i.e. similar to cork for instance) and were completely dried during the tests. 3 Experimental aspects According to [25] the impact sound insulation test is probably the most currently applied in the context of natural and recycled sound insulation products because these products are very likely to be applied as a resilient layer of floating floors. This test was also adopted here to evaluate the sound insulation potential of the corn cob particleboard. The standards [26–29] were followed. The experimental setups are crucial stages for the success of this study which is described in detail in the following sections. Some adopted experimental simplifications are also used. 3.1 Facility, equipment and setup Two classrooms of a building located in the university of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro campus, in Vila Real city, Portugal, were adopted as emitting and receiving rooms. Both rooms are geometrically similar and have the layout shown in Fig. 2 . One room is superjacent (i.e. the emitting room which is located on the second floor) to the other (i.e. the receiving room which is located on the first floor). There is a road next to the building and, therefore, the sound resulting from the traffic had to be taken into account in this evaluation. The tests were performed in July 2011, when the semester had already ended and there were no classes. A sonometer (Fig. 3 a) and a percussion machine (Fig. 3b) were the main equipment used. Four corn cob particleboard samples were used. They were displayed on the floor of the emitting room as Fig. 2 shows and according to the recommendations of the NP EN ISO 140-7 [26]. A minimum distance of 0.5m between the samples and the border of the floor, and a 45° angle between alignments of the samples and the reinforced concrete structural elements (e.g. beams) were guaranteed. The percussion machine was positioned on the floor of the emitting room following the same position pattern. A stationary sound field (with a continuous spectrum on the one-third octave bands from 100Hz to 3.15kHz) was produced. The noise generated by the percussion machine was ensured to be sufficient to produce noise levels at least 10dB higher than the background noise on the receiving room for each frequency band. Meanwhile, the positions of the sonometer, in the emitting or receiving rooms, were defined in order to guarantee the following restraints: minimum distance between sonometer positions of 0.7m; minimum distance between the sonometer position and the border of the pavement (or any diffusion building element) of 0.5m; minimum distance between sonometer position and percussion machine of 1.0m. In this case, the adopted distances are identified in Fig. 2. Five different positions of the sonometer were used. Each measurement took at least 10s. For each position of the percussion machine the sonometer was placed in the five denoted positions, with and without the panels. To ensure that parasite noises would not affect the final result, the background noise in the receiving room was measured. The reverberation times in the receiving room were measured according to the EN ISO 3382-2 [29]. For each position of the sound source (balloon burst), three distinct positions of the sonometer were used two positions of the source were used). The sonometer was calibrated at the beginning and at the end of all the measurements to guarantee that a difference of 0.5dB from the reference value was not exceeded. In order to perform all the calculations the sonometer software dBBATI from 01dB was used because of its simplicity and effectiveness. Other research works have been successfully using this tool in similar contexts such as [30]. Alternatively, the calculations could be done analytically or numerically using Excel tools for instance. 3.2 Simplification According to the standards EN ISO 10140-3 [31] and EN ISO 10140-5 [32] the sound insulation layer is expected to be placed underneath the regularization layer of a pavement (Fig. 4 a) and similarly to the following building system (from the bottom to the top): bottom finishing (1, Fig. 4a); reinforced concrete slab (2, Fig. 4a); sound insulation layer (3, Fig. 4a); polyethylene layer (4, Fig. 4a); regularization layer (5, Fig. 4a) and top finishing layer (6, Fig. 4a). In this case, the emitting and the receiving rooms are horizontally separated by an already existing pavement which is formed by four layers and as follows (from the bottom to the top): a 0.1cm painting layer (1, Fig. 4b); a 45cm thick reinforced concrete slab (2, Fig. 4b);. a 3cm thick light weight concrete regularization layer (3, Fig. 4b) and a 0.3cm thick polymer based material top finishing (4, Fig. 4b). There is no specific sound insulation layer or polyethylene layer. Therefore, taking into account the existing and adopted facility, it was not possible to guarantee integrally the building detail scenario prescribed in the EN ISO 10140-3 [31] and the EN ISO 10140-5 [32] standards in this research work and at this stage. For simplicity’s sake, the adopted alternative building solution (Fig. 4b) consisted in placing the corn cob particleboard (i.e. the sound insulation layer, 5 in Fig. 4b) above of the top finishing layer of the pavement (4, Fig. 4b) instead of being placed underneath the regularization layer (Fig. 4a). Considering that the main goal of this research is focused on knowing if the proposed corn cob particleboard has any sound insulation relevance then we sincerely believe that this experimental simplification is acceptable at this stage. 4 Experimental results and discussion Firstly, the ambient (or background) noise of the receiving room had to be evaluated. The average value of this registered noise is presented in the graph of Fig. 5 for a wide range of frequencies. This information is complemented with the data of Table 1 . Secondly, the resulting impact noise in the receiving room from the action of the percussion machine on the original pavement of the emitting room was registered. Different positions of the percussion machine (in the emitting room) and the sonometer (in the receiving room) were adopted, as described in Section 3.1. The average values of the registered impact noise in the receiving room for the range of frequencies suggested in [26] are presented in Fig. 6 a and complemented with the data of Table 2 . Thirdly, this experimental procedure was repeated but considering the existence of the corn cob particleboard placed on the pavement of the emitting room (Fig. 4b). The respective average values of the impact noise in the receiving room are featured in Fig. 6b. Fourthly, it was also necessary to assess the reverberation time in order to quantify the impact sound insulation of the pavement (without and with the corn cob particleboard). Therefore, this measure was experimentally estimated in the receiving room and its average values are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3 . Finally, it was possible to quantify the impact sound insulation of the pavement based on the above measures. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 8 a and b for the original and for the sound insulated pavement of the receiving room, respectively. This information is complemented with the data displayed in Table 4 . These data correspond to the weightened impact sound insulation levels with the reverberation time correction ( L ′ ntw ), for the two scenarios (without and with the panel), which were calculated according to [27], and in which the contribution of each frequency band under study for the final impact sound insulation index is defined. Comparing the results presented in Fig. 8a and b, a sound insulation benefit of the pavement is clearly achieved by applying corn cob particleboard on the floor of the emitting room. The impact sound insulation gain (ΔLw ) was estimated in 30dB. This result leads to the conclusion that the proposed corn cob particleboard may have an interesting ability in terms of sound insulation. In order to complement this analysis, Table 5 , given in [9], presents the impact sound insulation gains of different natural (e.g. kenaf, coconut fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose) and traditional (e.g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) sound insulation products. All the products have a thickness of 2cm contrasting with the 3cm of thickness of the studied corn cob particleboard. Taking into account the above described experimental simplification (Section 3.2) and the fact that the tested corn cob panel is thicker than the other products, the data of Table 5 may not be directly comparable with the data obtained for the corn cob particleboard. However, it corroborates the idea that the proposed manufactured corn cob particleboard may give a contribution to the sustainable sound insulation products context because it may have an acceptable impact sound insulation capacity for building purposes. 5 Conclusions A corn cob particleboard is proposed which intends to be an alternative affordable and sustainable sound insulation product fit to be applied in the building industry. It may be an alternative to the traditional impact sound products such as glass wool and expanded polystyrene, and also an additional solution to the set of natural products that has been proposed. Cotton, cellulose, hemp, wool, clay, jute, cork, sisal, kenaf, coir, feather or coco are among those natural sound insulation products. The sound insulation capacity of the proposed product was indirectly experimentally estimated by analyzing the sound insulation improvement of a pavement acoustically reinforced with it. Therefore, impact sound insulation tests were performed following the standard NP EN ISO 140-7 [26] and the rating of impact sound insulation was calculated following the standard ISO 717-2 [27]. The ambient noise of the receiving room, the impact noise in the receiving room for the scenarios of the original pavement and of the sound insulation reinforced pavement with corn cob panel, and the reverberation time were acoustic measures which it was necessary to obtain. Based on these experimentally obtained measures the impact sound insulation of the pavement, for the two considered scenarios, was then numerically quantified. The results indicate a 30dB gain in terms of impact sound insulation capacity by applying the corn cob panel on the floor of the emitting room. After comparing this gain with the respective ones related to the most currently applied traditional insulation products in the building industry (e.g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also to other alternative natural sound insulation products (e.g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose), the acoustic potential of the proposed product is highlighted. Nevertheless, further research is required in order to evaluate the exact values of the impact and the airborne sound insulation, and the sound absorption coefficients of the proposed manufactured corn cob particleboard. In this case, laboratory test facilities with suppressed flanking transmission between rooms and a reverberant room are required. At the same time, a parametric study relating the granulometry of the corn cob particles and the thickness of the panel with the sound insulation performance is also required.

The proposed method relies on the color image for accurate reconstruction of the lost contour segments in the corresponding depth map areas. Such reconstructed depth map contours are then used as boundaries at different depth planes to recover the missing depth values through weighted interpolation. The method performance is evaluated by the objective quality (PSNR) of the synthesised views. Images decoded with the reconstructed depth maps are compared with those of the reference method. The proposed method exhibits PSNR gains up to 1.49dB higher than the reference one, and a better performance is consistently achieved for different 3D image content. © 2012 IEEE.",

Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the term that is used for wireless sensor and control networks that use batteries or energy harvesting techniques to power the device. With the availability of low cost integrated circuits to perform the sensing, signal processing, communication, and data collection functions, coupled with the versatility that wireless networks afford, we can move away from fixed, hard-wired network installations in both new construction as well as retrofits of existing installations [1]. Recent advances in wireless sensor networking technology, have led to the development of low cost, low power, multifunctional sensor nodes. Sensor nodes enable environment sensing together with data processing. Instrumented with a variety of sensors, such as temperature, humidity and volatile compound detection, allows different environments monitoring. They are able to network with other sensor systems and exchange data with external users [2]. On daily life diabetes patients should, in order to reduced complications originated by the disease, follow a tight metabolic control [3], to achieved this patients currently puncture their fingers several times during the day using glucose meters [4] based on the enzyme sensor technology developed by Clark and Lyons [5] in 1962. Patients should also perform once every 2 to 3 months a test to the percentage of glycated hemoglobin, or HbA1c, in the blood in order to control the average blood glucose. The system proposed by Martins, et al [6] not only helps patients to follow this tight control by emitting alarms at the control times but, when link together with the monitor glucose sensor like the one proposed by Leal, et al [7] can automatically take into account measurements and inform the patients about any actions to be undertaken. In fact the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the International Diabetes Federation) [8] decided that the A1c assay should be considered as the primary method for the diagnosis of diabetes [9]. HbA1c is a stable glycated hemoglobin derivative formed by the non-enzymatic reaction of glucose with the N- -chain of normal adult Hb (HbA). Since it reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding 2-3 months and is not affected by the daily fluctuation of the glucose level, the HbA1c level provides a more accurate index for diagnosis and long term control of the disease. Traditionally, clinical laboratory assays for HbA1c have been obtained by ion-exchange chromatography, immunochemical methods, electrophoresis and boronate affinity chromatography. All these methods share a common disadvantage, they need expensive equipments and trained personnel thus making the best control and diagnosis method unsuitable for point-of-care. Therefore an AAL system with a glucose monitor device can indeed create a database where, not only immediate measurements are store, but an average of the blood glucose level can be perform allowing patients and doctors to better diagnose and control the disease. 2. Battery-less wireless system The block diagram of Figure 1 illustrates the battery-less wireless system. The implementation is based on the TMS37157 (PaLFI) low-frequency device a CC2540 microcontroller plus Bluetooth on chip solution and the Balun-Low Pass Filter integrated passive component 2450BM15A0002 to enable easy antenna matching. Finally the TPS62730 is use to power supply the sensor and microcontroller. 183 SÃ©rgio Silva et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 181 â€“ 188 Figure 1 - Principle Schematic of the non-battery Wireless Sensor The input of the DC/DC converter TPS71433 or TPS62730 is connected to VCL trough diode D1. D1 prevents the resonance circuit (consisting of LR and CR) from any disturbances coming from the dc/dc converter. Capacitor CBAT stores the energy derived from the RF field [10]. Using an external dc/dc converter instead of the internal of the TMS37157 overcomes the issue of higher currents because the external dc/dc converter can provide higher output currents in comparison to the internal regulator (80 mA compared to 5 mA). The Glucose Sensor Output signal will enter the CC2540 on P0 7 as seen on Figure 1. This input will be compared with an internal reference voltage and sent to the Sigma Delta modulator. As stated by Leal, et al [7] the Vout signal from the Glucose sensor should be presented to at least 10 bits Analogical to Digital Converter (ADC). The selected chip CC2540 uses a 12 bits ADC to convert the Glucose output signal. This modulated signal will then be sent to the decimation filter where a sampling frequency of 4 MHz is be provided by the 32 MHz crystal oscillator provided by pins XOSC Q1 and XOSC Q2. The selected ADC uses a default sampling frequency of 4 MHz generated by fixed internal division. Figure 2 - Adapted ADC Block diagram [10] 184 SÃ©rgio Silva et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 181 â€“ 188 This binary data is then sent to the radio registers shown in Figure 2 via the Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller. The DMA controller operation is programmed using the M Code control signal. One of the most important features of a wireless system is his robustness in term of harsh environments. The proposed system ensures that by the use of the Low Frequency Band and also by adding redundancy to the transmission data (data is send to LF Reader and to BLE master receiver), later the protocol compares and validates the readings obtained. During LF transmissions, a FSK signal is transmitted. The resonance frequency of the trimmed antenna circuit (fL) represents a low bit and high bits, are represented by a lower frequency (fH), which is achieved by switching in a Modulation Capacitor in parallel with the antenna resonance circuit [10]. Figure 3 shows the global system where the glucose sensor receives power from the LF reader, undertakes measurements and emits Bluetooth LE signal that can be received by the wrist watch, the BLE phone or the main Ambient Assisted Living program running on the PC. 3. Power Sources- RF Energy Harvesting For an implanted system the selected power can determine the life time cycle of the system. The purpose of our model is to be auto-sufficient so in order to achieve this goal we choose a RF energy harvesting as main supply for the system. The TMS37157 from Texas Instruments is the heart of our harvesting system, capable of directly supplying up to 4 mA to an external Microcontroller and sensor. Nevertheless we add to the circuit the TPS71433 in order to ensure an higher current supply (up to 80 mA [11]). The total current consumption of our circuit can be estimated from the modules datasheet and its equal to 25 mA plus Glucose Sensor therefore our Glucose sensor can consume up to 55 mA. Figure 3 - Global Ambient Assisted Living system 185 SÃ©rgio Silva et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 181 â€“ 188 4. Bluetooth Low Energy Protocol The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol stack architecture is illustrated on Figure 4. The protocol stack consists of two sections: the controller and the host. This separation of control and host goes back to standard Bluetooth BR/EDR devices, in which the two sections were often implemented separately. The profile and application that are being used sit on top of the GAP and GATT layers of the stack. The PHY layer is a 1Mbps adaptive frequency-hopping Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK) radio operating in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band. The PHY layer essentially controls the RF state of the device, being in one of five possible states: standby, advertising, scanning, initiating, or connected. Advertisers transmit data without being in a connection, while scanners listen for advertisers. An initiator is a device that is responding to an advertiser with a connection request. If the advertiser accepts, both the advertiser and initiator will enter a connected state. When a device is in a connection, it will be connected in one of two roles: master or slave. The device that initiated the connection becomes the master, and the other device that accepted the request becomes the slave, as showed in Figure 5. Figure 4 - BLE Protocol Stack Figure 5 - Device states [10] 186 SÃ©rgio Silva et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 181 â€“ 188 The HCI layer provides a means of communication between the host and controller via a standardized interface. The L2CAP layer provides data encapsulation services to the upper layers, allowing for logical end-to-end communication of data. The SM layer defines the methods for pairing and key distribution, and provides functions for the other layers of the stack to securely connect and exchange data with another device. The GAP layer directly interfaces with the application and/or profiles, and handles device discovery and connection related services for the device. In addition, GAP handles the initiation of security features. The ATT protocol allows a device to expose certain pieces of data, k f the device. For example, a master device may either be an ATT server or an ATT client, and a slave device may also be either an ATT server or an ATT client. It is also possible for a device to be both an ATT server and an ATT client simultaneously. The GATT layer is a service framework that defines the sub procedures for using ATT. GATT specifies the structure of profiles. In BLE, all pieces of data that are being used by a profile or service are called r between two devices in a BLE connection are handled through GATT sub-procedures. Therefore, the application and/or profiles will directly use GATT. The Bluetooth receiver displayed on Figure 6 allows the Ambient Assisted Living application from Martins, et al [6] to process the data collected in order to detect anomalies and issue an alert. The AAL application is connect not only to the Glucose sensor but with other complement sensors namely ECG, Body temperature, SpO2m, body weight and pressure sensors. The java application has three layers structure. The first layer is responsible for the signals acquisition and acts directly with the Bluetooth receiver. The second layer analyses and converts all the received data from the sensors. Finally the third layer is responsible for the graphic representation of the data shown Figure 7. Figure 6 - CC2540 Receiver [6] Figure 7 - Graphics from Martins, et al application [6] 187 SÃ©rgio Silva et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 181 â€“ 188 Figure 9 - Osmotic pressure changes during three experimental trials performed on albumin solutions with concentration of 1 (label 1), 0.5 (label 2) 5. Results The sensor used for tests was the glucose used by Leal, et al [7] on their work and showed on Figure 8. The experimental assays were performed using albumin (albumin from bovine serum, EC No. 232-9362, M W = 67 kDa, Fluka, USA) in concentrations of 0, 0.5 and 1 mM in order to simulate low, medium and high solute concentration, respectively. The obtained behavior of the developed monitoring system to the performed experiments is illustrated in Figure 9. From the analysis of this behavior, we can conclude that the system showed a positive response to the different albumin concentrations in means of osmotic pressure variations. The data obtained was send transmitted by the system with Bluetooth protocol.

Conclusions This work presents a Bluetooth prototype low power battery-less wireless sensor communication system capable transmitting the information to a mobile phone, wrist wireless phone or windows PC application. The use of Low Power Bluetooth in conjunction with well known establishes harvesting RF methods allows the development of new wireless battery-less sensors may work for years without battery replacement. An energy aware microcontroller, and an optimized RF Radio link delivers the reality of long life, maintenance-free Zero Power Wireless Sensor, providing cheap sensor nodes to be use together with Ambient Assisted Living systems like the one Martins, et al implemented. With population aging, health monitoring systems need to adapt to new situations, giving patients and doctors freedom of move along with knowledge of patients habits necessary to determine correct therapy application on different environs and making life of chronicle diseased patients, like diabetics, easer and reducing the number of disease complications. The pursuit must continuous in order to prove the application of BLE in Ambient Assisted scenarios and assures doctors of QoS (Quality of Service). Future work includes testing the implemented prototype robustness and performs measurements in real time scenarios. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Erik A.

We met the maxi-mum specifications possible of this standard and also consulted the manual \"Anechoic Reverberation Rooms\" of the Industrial Acoustics Company as an auxiliary document. In order to validate the results, a comparison was made between the ones obtained by measurements \"in-situ\" and the ones found in technical specifications of the tested materials. In addition to concluding that the values obtained are similar to those that rely on the data sheet of each material tested, we were able to confirm the correlation between the technical specifications of the ISO and the absorption values obtained for each of the frequency bands under consideration and note that it can be obtained some reliable values in the specific case of the room used.",

The proposed method maintains contour smoothness and uses them as the boundary limits of homogeneous depth regions, which are then filled through weighted pixel interpolation. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields better synthesized images than classic spatial concealment methods, uniquely based on pixel interpolation techniques.

Relevant factors for service providers and enterprises using VoIP technology are described, such as those related to measurement of intelligibility and evaluation of overall voice communications quality. Also, the most relevant voice quality evaluation methods recommended by the ITU-T are described along with the main features that can be used to improve voice communications. Fundamental concepts are presented, such as intrusive, non intrusive, objective, subjective and parametric methods. Mastering the concepts of such emerging technology, has recently lead to research and development of a model-based voice quality monitor for VoIP services.

        "doc_abstract": "The evolution of telecommunications technology from circuit to packet switching, in which the Internet is the great Paradigm, offers nowadays more flexibility in services and higher efficiency in the transport infrastructure that was not experienced before. As consequence, several new services have emerged. Among them, Voice over IP (VoIP) is, indubitably, one of the most popular, mainly because it allows anyone to make low cost voice calls, making it a very attractive service. This is perhaps one of the main factors responsible for the fast development of VoIP technology. However, IP networks were not designed for services with real time requirements and factors like delay, jitter, codec distortions and packet loss lead to degradations that directly influence de VoIP user experience. The quality experienced by these users is highly dependent on network conditions and also on the subjective experience perceived by them. Thus, new challenges have brought with this evolution of telecommunications networks. In order to meet the assigned Service Level Agreement (SLA's), service providers around the world need to monitor and guarantee the agreed Quality of Service (QoS) to its customers. Consequently, an emergent way to measure QoS arises in the field of the telecommunications sector: the Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment and monitor that takes into account that subjective experience. Thus, a new challenging need arises: the development of systems and methods for assessing quality of experience, such that, network operators and service providers can actually know how users evaluate the quality of the service provided to them. In this paper, a system for assessing QoS/QoE is described: the ArQoS. This is an integrated system provided by Portugal Telecom Inovação (PTIn) which implements QoE assessment methods to assess the networks performance and their telecommunications services. Beyond the existing methods already supported by the system, a novel QoE monitor for VoIP services was recently integrated as a result of fundamental research carried out at PTIn Labs. The ArQoS is a probing system based on different types of probes, actually comprising two systems operating in two different modes: the active system (intrusive mode) and the passive system (non-intrusive mode). The ArQoS active system is based on intrusive probing and is intended to generate test calls on different types of networks (fixed/mobile/IP), simulating typical user's activity. It is possible to create interactive or scheduled tests with a custom task pool. The system gathers QoS network Parameters (KPI and KQI), and evaluates the functional aspects of its associated network services, according to the related ETSI/ITU-T/IETF/3GPP standards and recommendations. The ArQoS passive system is designed to analyse VoIP traffic, including signaling (SIP, Megaco, Radius, Diameter) and media stream (RTP) protocols. Passive probes analyse multi Parallel RTP voice traffic without any interference in the communication. These probes can be setup close to any element of the VoIP network, such as VoIP clients, Media Gateways or in the core of the network. Collected data is gathered, analysed and processed automatically at the server management system, providing many QoS/QoE statistics. The user system manager can also use the system to trace a VoIP call in every probing point and in every protocol involved, allowing the end user to troubleshoot any possible problem. The ArQoS® passive probes are deployed in the Portugal Telecom VoIP Network core. A general diagram of the application scenario is depicted in Fig.1. All VoIP traffic converges in a Softswitch that controls all VoIP network. The connection to PSTN and Mobile networks is performed by a Media Gateway. The Session Border Controller (SBC) interconnects networks of different service providers, implements security functions and manages QoS guarantees, among other functions. The ArQoS® probes analyse the entire flow that converges to the Softswitch, and monitor all signaling traffic. The RTP traffic is analysed in the Media Gateway checking the performance of transmission network. In SBC, the quality of interoperability between operators is analysed. Fig. 2 presents a block diagram of ArQoS VoIP QoE monitor, which was developed and integrated in the ArQoS passive probes. The voice RTP packets are captured and processed by the probe, and then the Jitter Buffer Emulator accurately predicts which packets are lost or discarded. In the Gilbert Model module, the packet loss distribution is calculated. This distribution and other network metrics are inputs for ArQoS® Speech Assessment Model, which implements the novel QoE monitoring model based on the E-Model. This model is described in detail in the paper \"Quality model for monitoring QoE in VoIP services\" from the Same authors at EUROCON'2011. Using this enhanced QoE model, the ArQoS passive system provides now better estimates of voice quality, than the standard E-Model. Table 1 shows that the correlation factor of estimated quality is higher and the RMSE is lower than the standard E-Model. Thus, the novel QoE monitoring system allows the translation of pure QoS metrics such as packet loss rate and jitter to a perceptual QoE metric: the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Overall the integration of this novel QoE monitoring model in the ArQoS system has improved its technical characteristics and proved to be a successful case of technology transfer between academic institutions and the industry. © 2011 IEEE.",

Extensive field testing was carried out to validate the proposed model at PT Inovação Labs (Portugal). The results show that the mean opinion score (MOS) obtained from the proposed model match class C2 of conformance tests defined in ITU-T Recommendation P.564. The QoE model described in this paper was implemented in a VoIP QoE probe and is currently fully operational at Portugal Telecom. © 2011 IEEE.",

The system utilizes osmotic pressure as the sensing mechanism and consists of a sensor prototype that is integrated together with a pre-amplifier and data acquisition unit for both data recording and processing. The sensor prototype is based on an embedded silicon absolute pressure transducer and a semipermeable nanoporous membrane that is enclosed in the sensor housing. The glucose monitoring system facilitates the integration of a low power microcontroller that is combined with a wireless inductive powered communication link. Experimental verification have proven that the system is capable of tracking osmotic pressure changes using albumin as a model compound, and thereby show a proof of concept for novel long term tracking of blood glucose from remote sensor nodes. © 2011 IFSA.",

As it was expected, the induction motor is sensitive to voltage fluctuations within certain amplitude levels and frequencies. Also, the speed is more affected by low frequencies and high amplitudes of voltage fluctuations, while the torque and efficiency are more affected by middle and high frequencies and amplitudes. ©2010 IEEE.",

This new design, with the possibility to assembly the probe and electronics in the same package, with low-cost, and with less power consumption compared to conventional HPP, make it suitable to be connected to wireless data acquisition systems in precision agriculture. The probe was tested in agar to demonstrate the potential advantages of the button heat pulse sensor for soil water content measurements. It was possible to have an 0.5 °C temperature rise with only 156mW of power consumption, a ten times power reduction in heat-pulse soil water content measurements.

When we observe a video sequence it becomes noticeable that great part of the information remains unchanged regardless of the bit rate or frame rate used. One origin of discontinuity in video signals is directly related to movement. Several areas use high frame rate images to analyze and comprehend certain events or effects, biomechanical engineering is one of them. Biomechanics engineering studies the mechanics of a living body, especially the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on the skeletal structure. Some examples are athlete assessment, were images are capture and then the acquired parameters are analyzed. This article describes a new methodology to decrease the space needed to store high frame rate image sequences in the specific case of biomechanical related areas. © 2010 IEEE.",

Indeed, such relationship appears to be quite complex, within IT contexts, and especially in socially and technologically rich learning environments, where related skills and learning are progressively required and fostered. Thus, if a satisfactory level of intellectual performance and social competence of a primary school pupil is indeed highly dependent on the type of participation that parents offer their children, IT, in general, and Internet, in particular, may well provide a new paradigm, setting forth that education and communication approach is truly more complex than ever before. It is on the basis of such paradigm that we therefore present a case study where a set of multimedia exercises were used in order to possibly improve the mathematical skills of pupils, one with mental retardation and another with cerebral palsy. Being part of a Web-based system to support students' learning, the referred set of multimedia exercises proved to be the children's favorite, rather than exercises in paper form, which also led the children to show a fair more positive attitude towards learning. Also, we observed that through the mentioned multimedia exercises, the children became far more autonomous, interested, persistent, happy, and able to easily absorb the material as well as more willingly to continue on working. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.",

Perpetual operation of a network node is undoubtedly one of the major goals of any energy-aware protocol or power-efficient hardware platform. Energy harvesting has emerged as the natural way to keep small stationary hardware platforms running, even when operating continuously as network routing devices. This paper analyses solar radiation, wind and water flow as feasible energy sources that can be explored to meet the energy needs of a wireless sensor network router within the context of precision agriculture, and presents a multi-powered platform solution for wireless devices. Experimental results prove that our prototype, the MPWiNodeX, can manage simultaneously the three energy sources for charging a NiMH battery pack, resulting in an almost perpetual operation of the evaluated ZigBee network router. In addition to this, the energy scavenging techniques double up as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed, a capability that avoids the use of specific sensors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The deployment of large mesh-type wireless networks is a challenge due to the multitude of arising issues. Perpetual operation of a network node is undoubtedly one of the major goals of any energy-aware protocol or power-efficient hardware platform. Energy harvesting has emerged as the natural way to keep small stationary hardware platforms running, even when operating continuously as network routing devices. This paper analyses solar radiation, wind and water flow as feasible energy sources that can be explored to meet the energy needs of a wireless sensor network router within the context of precision agriculture, and presents a multi-powered platform solution for wireless devices. Experimental results prove that our prototype, the MPWiNodeX, can manage simultaneously the three energy sources for charging a NiMH battery pack, resulting in an almost perpetual operation of the evaluated ZigBee network router. In addition to this, the energy scavenging techniques double up as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed, a capability that avoids the use of specific sensors. Keywords Energy harvesting Power management Energy sources Acquisition station Precision agriculture 1 Introduction The energy necessary for the deployment of stand-alone wireless sensor networks in large, open fields still dominates the overall system budget (Rabaey et al., 2000). The harvesting of energy from the surrounding space to power these systems is a solution being explored by several authors, including Wang et al. (2006); Thomas et al. (2006); Cantatore and Ouwerkerk (2006) and Priya et al. (2005). These works cover areas such as irrigation control systems, weather and environmental monitoring, greenhouse control, animal identification and health monitoring. But to effectively attain perpetual operation further enhancements in energy scavenging and more efficient power conditioning methods are required. In the case of precision agriculture (PA), massive amounts of data (Moreenthaler et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2006) are gathered to estimate, for instance, a growth profile, which suggests that sensors or even complete acquisition systems should be installed close to the plant itself. This implies dense ad-hoc networks of wireless devices, sufficiently flexible to support the disparate sources of data that can be extracted from the plant and its surrounding environment (Stafford, 2000). Besides, the wireless network should be able to cover a large area, which means that each acquisition device should be capable of operating as a network router. Fig. 1 shows an illustration of our motivation scenario where a ZigBee network is deployed on a vineyard management zone to collect environmental data. The harvested energy sources are usually ubiquitous in the nodes’ surrounding space but random in nature (Paradiso and Starner, 2005; Hande et al., 2007), a characteristic that dictates the use of energy reservoirs, typically rechargeable batteries or, more recently, ultracapacitors (Park and Chou, 2006). In the case of wireless nodes operating as network routers the energy demands are considerable, and several sources of energy, possibly of different nature, may be required. This raises questions about the power density associated with such sources, how to harvest and manage them to achieve self-sustained, perpetual operation (Corke et al., 2007). Design considerations regarding sensor networks, hardware design, network and medium access control protocols, battery management and harvesting techniques are discussed for instance in Raghunathan et al. (2005); Chou and Park (2005); Mainwaring et al. (2002) and Jiang et al. (2005). Dubois-Ferrière et al. (2006) describe TinyNode, a generic platform for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, which operates with a small solar panel used to replenish two separate energy buffers (primary and secondary). Although not intended for perpetual operation, the authors present an interesting and useful comparison between supercapacitors and batteries for variable operation duty-cycle. They also present a comparison between current consumption of similar platforms, the Mica2, the Telos Sky, the EyesIFX and the TinyNode. The solution to power indoor routers proposed by Hande et al. (2007) depends on a photonic energy harvesting device that consists of a set of solar cells connected in series-parallel to scavenge energy from 34 W fluorescent lights. However, the approach has drawbacks: on one hand, each router requires two nodes operating at 50% duty-cycle to minimise power consumption, a solution that duplicates the number of devices. On the other hand, it uses many solar cells that have to be located close to the lamps. Chou and Park (2005) mention the need for multiple power sources, but they regard this power fragmentation problem as a consequence of the fact that such energy sources may not be available at all times. Park and Chou (2006) review the Helicomote, the Prometheus, the Everlast and the PUMA as energy harvesting systems and present the AmbiMax, an energy harvesting circuit that uses a solar panel and a wind generator to charge a supercapacitor-based energy storage system. In this case, the authors have focused their research in the harvesting efficiency rather than in controlling the charging process to avoid, for instance, the battery aging issue. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how to take advantage of the existence of multiple energy sources in agricultural and livestock environments (open-field crops, greenhouses, hydroponic and aquaculture systems, and stables) by harvesting energy from the sun, wind and moving water, as discussed in Section 2. The energy harvesters used in our experiments comprise a small solar-panel, a small hydro-generator placed in a nearby irrigation or hydroponic water pipe and a wind generator prototype that was designed to be part of the supporting structure of each acquisition platform. Section 3 describes the power-management behind a wireless data acquisition platform (WDAP) that uses the energy harvested from the three sources to simultaneously replenish a common 650mAh NiMH battery pack, enabling almost perpetual operation of a network router with general-purpose data acquisition capabilities. Another feature of our approach, which complements the idea of harvesting from multiple sources, is to use the energy harvesting circuits as sensors of solar radiation and wind speed, which are relevant parameters in precision agriculture and other applications. This fusion or integration of the functions of generators and sensors makes conventional, separate sensors unnecessary. Regarding wireless network support, we have chosen (Morais et al., 2008) the ZigBee standard as a tool to create sensor an router nodes. Section 4 describes our main experimental results: laboratory as well as outdoor experiments confirm the feasibility of self-sustained near-perpetual operation of our WDAP. For this purpose we have built two similar data acquisition systems, targeted for different applications, their main difference being the wireless support. Our results also show that the built-in sensors provide measures that are in good agreement with those of conventional, reference sensors. Our conclusions and final remarks are presented in Section 5, which closes the paper. 2 Harvesting energy from the environment There is a variety of energy sources in the environment around a sensor network (Thomas et al., 2006; Paradiso and Starner, 2005) that are of potential interest for energy harvesting. They include photonic (includes solar energy as well as artificial lightning); vibrations (harvested using piezoelectric, electro-magnetic and capacitive converters); kinetic (available in moving water in rivers, pipes and wind flow); magnetic (magnetic fields surrounding AC power lines); pressure; and heat differentials (harvested using thermoelectric elements), where a comprehensive overview of these can be found in (Roundy et al., 2004). However, many of these sources may have to be neglected due to practical constraints or challenges raised by the low energy density, target power requirements and, in some cases, feasibility of the energy harvesting method. Solar energy is the most efficient natural energy source available for sensor networks in outdoor applications (Thomas et al., 2006). An understanding of the relative importance and potential of solar and wind energy requires data on solar irradiation and wind velocity. The PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System) on-line solar irradiation data utility, part of the SOLAREC action at the JRC Renewable Energies Unit of the European Commission (available at collects such data. The results for a few locations in Europe are summarised in Table 1 . It also includes wind data (the values for Vila Real were obtained by us, those for the other locations are available at The average horizontal irradiation for the city of Vila Real, northeast Portugal, is about 420.6 mWh/(cm2 day). A network router device with a 40mA continuous average current draw at 3.3V would require an energy of about 3168mWh/day, which can be harvested by a 10% efficient, 75.3cm2 solar panel. The active area of the solar panel has to increase to 215.1cm2 if we take the worst case value of 147.3mWh/(cm2 day) for the same location. If the solar panel inclination is optimal then the active area may be reduced to 130cm2. Table 1 also shows the average wind speed and the probability that the wind velocity exceeds the Beaufort value 4, which corresponds to an average wind velocity of 5.5–7.9m/s, or a median velocity of 6.7m/s, over a 10-min interval (see also Fig. 2 ). In the context of precision agriculture, and specially in hydroponic practices or close to irrigation systems, it makes sense to explore the kinetic energy from moving water. This can be harvested through a suitable hydro-generator and, as we will see, it may considerably supplement the WDAP energy reservoir. Our multi-source energy supply harvesting strategy, including the appropriate enclosure box, is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The WDAP is used in a vineyard management zone to collect data from soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation as a part of an on-going project. The energy is in this case supplied by sun, wind and moving water. In the latter case, the energy is harvested by a hydrogenerator located in a nearby irrigation pipe. 2.1 Solar-energy harvesting Solar-energy harvesting is based on the well-known principle of photo-voltaic conversion, and provides the highest power density (15 mWcm−2on a bright sunny day), making it the best-suited choice to power wireless acquisition systems in outdoor applications. Since the power output of small solar panels is limited, two main design principles for the solar-harvesting modules are considered. First, the system should extract the maximum power at each time instant and, second, the efficiency of the power management sub-systems should be maximised. In practice, strict adherence to these principles is difficult, and trade-offs have to be considered, due to the interaction of factors such as the characteristics of the solar cells and their active area, power conditioning features, application requirements of the wireless system and, the chemistry and capacity of the batteries used to store the harvested energy. But to maximise solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency the power conditioning subsystem should operate at the solar panels’ maximum power point (MPP), the point in the V–I characteristic that corresponds to the maximum power transfer. Our prototype, the MPWiNodeX platform, uses a commercial solar panel (MSX-005 from Solarex, USA) chosen because of its small size, availability and low cost. This 8-cell solar-panel has an active area of 57.0 mm × 95.8 mm (54.6cm2), a rated V oc of 4.6V and I sc of 160mA. The MPP occurs at a voltage of approximately 3.1V, which means that the power conditioning circuit should ensure operation at (or near) this point. Regarding the harvesting circuit, one approach is to clamp the output terminals of the solar panel to a rechargeable battery (Raghunathan et al., 2006). This forces the solar panel to operate at a point on its V–I curve determined by the battery’s terminal voltage. This has the advantage of minimising the energy losses in the transfer mechanism, but depends on a careful choice of battery and solar panel in order to ensure that the operating point of the system remains close to the MPP. In the cited example, two NiMH batteries are charged, via a blocking diode, by a solar panel with a MPP occurring at 3.0V. Battery voltage varies between 2.2 and 2.8V, and due to the voltage drop in the blocking diode, the voltage across the solar panel remains close to optimal. It only harvests energy when the solar panel output voltage is 0.7V higher then that of the battery which means that a significant amount of energy cannot be harvested. Moreover, there is no tracking of the MPP, which is essential to achieve high harvesting efficiency (Park and Chou, 2006). Also, the energy flow is unmanageable, resulting in uncontrolled daily recharge cycles and placing a significant stress on the battery. Our solution represents an integrated approach to the management and conditioning of the solar-panel, wind generator and hydrogenerator blocks (described in the following two sections). It includes a smart-battery charge control that balances battery lifetime and energy harvesting efficiency, as described in detail in Section 3.1. 2.2 Wind flow kinetic energy harvesting Wind flow kinetic energy can be harvested by a wind turbine which extracts energy from moving air by slowing it down and using the obtained energy to drive a generator. The power P w associated with a quantity of air of mass m, flowing at speed v in the x direction, is the time derivative of the kinetic energy: (1) P w = 1 2 ρ A d x d t v 2 = 1 2 ρ A v 3 , where ρ is the air density in kgm−3, A is the cross-sectional area in m2 and v is the upstream or undisturbed wind speed in m/s. An ideal turbine can extract a fraction of the power in (1) given by the Betz coefficient 16/27 or 59.26% (Betz, 1926). The power extracted by a practical turbine is (2) P m = C p 1 2 ρ A v 3 = C p P w . where C p is the performance coefficient of the turbine. Assuming that the turbine is coupled to a transmission with efficiency η m which drives a generator of efficiency η g , the electrical power P e available can be written as (3) P e = C p η m η g P w = C p η m η g 1 2 ρ A v 3 . Wind turbines can be classified into two general types based on the axis of rotation. Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) have the rotor shaft parallel to ground and must be pointed into the direction of wind flow by some means. They are usually used for large-scale windmills for electrical energy production. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have a vertically rotating main rotor shaft. Although less efficient, VAWTs offer some important advantages in small-scale wind generator design, the Darrieus and Savonious designs being the most common. They are omni-directional, simpler, can be fixed in both ends and can respond quicker to changes in wind direction and velocity. The Darrieus type is based on lift forces which cause the rotor to move faster than the wind. They are efficient but usually not self-starting. The Savonious type is less efficient because they are drag-type devices (S-shaped cross section) but they are self-starting and virtually maintenance-free. To design the wind generator suited for our application it is necessary to bear in mind a number of practical and functional issues. Firstly, the energy harvested from the wind is intended to supplement the energy available for battery charging. Secondly, the wind generator should double up as a sensor, and be capable of supplying data on wind speed. Finally, the wind generator should be part of the structure of the acquisition station and especially of the rod which stands vertically on the ground (right side of Fig. 3). This means that the turbine swept area, namely its diameter, should be minimised. To fulfil these requirements, a Savonious design was chosen, despite its inherent low efficiency. The power extraction coefficient could be increased by adding a convergent nozzle to increase the rotor speed (Shikha et al., 2003). However, this requires wind coming from a fixed direction, which is not the case in our application target. A free moving vane would force the convergent nozzle into the direction of the wind, and could be used to obtain information about wind direction. The efficiency can be improved in a more simpler way by adopting a multi-blade rotor design. Fig. 4 illustrates the two VAWT that were constructed to evaluate the wind energy harvesting techniques. The right one is based on a six-blade Savonious design with 60 mm diameter and 200mm height (0.012m2 swept area), while the left one is based on three-stage based design as proposed by Hayashi et al. (2005). Assuming air standard conditions(pressure of 101.3kPa and temperature of 273K) and a power coefficient C p of 0.1, these turbines should extract a mechanical power of 97mW at a wind speed of 5m/s. 2.3 Water-flow kinetic energy harvesting The energy of moving liquids in pipes, such as water or liquid nutrients, can be harvested with a small-size hydrogenerator. To our best knowledge, this approach has not been explored to supply energy to small electronic devices in precision agriculture. We regard the pipes of irrigation control systems as power outlets within the crops. This idea may be even more relevant in aquaculture or hydroponics practices, where water is always recirculating in pipes. This suggests the possibility of supplying power to a sensor network based on the energy harvested from these pipes. To explore and validate this concept, a commercial hydrogenerator was used as a energy harvester for our WDAP. This device, illustrated in Fig. 5 , was developed and patented by Vulcano to replace batteries in smart gas-based water heating appliances for residential applications. With a principle of operation similar to large hydroelectric generation systems, a small quantity of water, derived from the main duct, is used to spin a turbine coupled to a DC generator. Fig. 6 shows the results of our experiments, conducted with the hydrogenerator for different values of inlet water flow. As can be seen, the hydrogenerator output voltage is almost constant and independent of the water flow value. Due to this characteristic, the water volume cannot be accurately measured, but its logical state can (flowing/not flowing, useful for detecting liquid movements). 3 System architecture To evaluate the energy harvesting techniques as well as the data correlation between reference sensors and data gathered from the energy harvesters, two different WDAP were designed, differing mainly in wireless support. The first and simplest prototype, the MPWiNodeS variant, uses a low-cost 8-bit RISC μ -controller (PIC18LF2620 from Microchip, AZ, USA) and a low-power RF transceiver (RC1280 from Radiocrafts, Norway). This device is currently being used as a development platform for the inclusion of the IEEE 1451 standard for sensor/network interoperability (Wei et al., 2005; Sweetser et al., 2006), with the objective of defining the energy harvesters transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS). The second prototype, the MPWiNodeZ, uses a wireless μ -controller (JN5139 from Jennic, UK) with a ZigBee-compliant stack, and provides the necessary standardised software tools to rapidly deploy sensor and router nodes in the field. These devices follow the block diagram depicted in Fig. 7 . A detailed explanation of the diagram is given in the following subsections. 3.1 Power management The power conditioning subsystem (Fig. 8 ) is responsible for charging the NiMH battery pack with energy harvested from the three considered energy sources. Each source has its own conditioning block, based on a highly efficient boost converter with 3.3/5.0 V output voltage, pin selectable. This converter allows a wide range of input voltages below the battery nominal output, which enables harvesting from low-voltage sources. The shutdown pin is used to implement a pulse charging mechanism, which simultaneously performs MPP tracking to enhance harvesting efficiency. This signal is generated by a comparator with hysteresis powered by the battery due to its ultra-low quiescent current. When the voltage at the charge reservoir capacitor (see Fig. 8) rises above a particular value, the comparator turns the boost converter on, transferring the charge stored at that capacitor to the battery, causing the input voltage to drop. Dropping below the lower-trip point of the comparator will result in the turn-off of the converter. This pulsed operation results in a more efficient charging method (Zhang et al., 2004), where the density of the generated shutdown pulses is related with the capability of the energy source to replenish the input charge reservoir. This relation is, in this work, explored to provide a coarse estimation of the magnitude of the parameter that supplies the energy to the system. To this effect, a second comparator with open drain output is used to generate similar yet independent pulses. The other feature is the output voltage selection pin, used to select the 3.3 or 5.0 V predefined value, which are, in this case, below and above the operating limits of a 3-cell NiMH battery. This is used to define the start and stop conditions, battery charging and floating, respectively. The systems’ power supply is derived from a wide input range DC–DC converter (MAX710 from Maxim, USA). Among other features, it has a low-battery indicator (LBI signal in Fig. 8) that is used to signal the μ -controller when the battery voltage falls below a predefined value, suitable for predicting the power-off. The μ -controller is responsible for sampling the battery voltage value and to control the operation of the conditioning subsystem. When the battery achieves a pre-programmed value, which could be the battery fully charged (BFC) voltage value, a normally closed power switch is used to break the charging path. This switch may also be used for discharging completely the battery as a way to minimise the aging issue by periodically promoting, if necessary, a full discharge/charge cycle. 3.1.1 Solar-panel power-conditioning block When conditioning solar energy, the boost converter described above is a more suited choice since it enables harvesting even in that cases that the solar panel output voltage is lower than the in-charging battery voltage level. As the internal resistance of the photovoltaic cells depends on the light levels, which causes a loss of efficiency when connecting it to the boost converters’ inductor, the input charge reservoir capacitor introduces two important improvements. By monitoring the voltage on this capacitor, the comparator turns on the boost converter when the solar panel voltage output is at its MPP. The comparator will turn-off the converter without allowing the converter’s input voltage to drop below its operating voltage limit. The turn-off condition will remain until the solar panel output voltage rises again to the optimum voltage. The input capacitor also provides a low-impedance path for the inductor current, which allows the efficient bang-bang control of charge transfer (Maxim, 2000). Fig. 9 illustrates the principle of operation of this bang-bang control, where it is also shown how the density of the charge transfer burst pulses are correlated with the received solar radiation intensity. It can be followed that the pulse density ( V PULSE,SP in Fig. 9) increases as the solar irradiance rises, which we regard as a solar radiation sensor output. 3.1.2 Wind generator and hydrogenerator power-conditioning blocks The wind generator is based on a four permanent magnet generator, which creates an alternating sinusoidal voltage with an amplitude and frequency proportional to the extracted wind mechanical power. Depending on the possible electrical connections that we can make with four windings, a rectifier is used before connecting this voltage source to the input of the power-conditioning block. A two-diode full-wave rectifier topology provides the higher electrical power extraction but causes more electromagnetic breaking, because current flows during the entire period. This leads to an equivalent higher starting torque when the DC value reaches the equivalent MPP. In other words, when the DC output from the generator reaches the ON switching condition of the boost converter, a higher current flows in all windings which causes breaking. To reduce this starting torque (enabling operation at lower speeds with the penalty of a lower efficiency) we have followed the half-wave rectifier approach to allow harvesting energy from low-speed winds. However, a power routing scheme can be implemented to switch from the half-wave to the full-wave rectifier mode whenever the wind speed is above a determined value. Power conditioning of these two generators is accomplished by the same principle of operation of the solar-panel power-conditioning block. The differences are the values (resistors in this case) that define the MPP for each energy harvester. The wind generator and hydrogenerator high trip-values were set to approximately 2.0 and 1.6 V, respectively. 3.1.3 Battery charge control The battery charging start and stop conditions are asserted by the μ -controller by means of the selection pin ( 3 / 5 ¯ ) of each boost converter (see Fig. 8). To this effect, the battery voltage is sampled periodically to monitor when it becomes fully charged. When it happens, the μ -controller sets the 3 / 5 ¯ line which causes the boost converter to be turned off because the output voltage is greater than the selected predefined output voltage. If the battery is actually discharging, and its voltage drops below some predefined value, the μ -controller may clear the 3 / 5 ¯ pin, which starts, or resumes, a charging cycle. At first sight, the selection of the switching points is straightforward. The voltage across a 3-cell NiMH battery should not exceed 3 × 1.45V = 4.35V, where 1.45V corresponds to a fully charged NiMH cell. To minimise battery aging, the discharge cycle should last until the voltage falls down to 3 × 0.9V = 2.7V, where 0.9V is the voltage across a completely discharged cell (Ying et al., 2006; Fetcenko et al., 2007). To avoid a fully discharged cell, even knowing that a residual energy may exist, we decided to limit the lower bound to a 3V value. Due to power fragmentation it becomes necessary to balance battery lifetime and energy harvesting efficiency. To better understand the need for the trade-off, consider that the battery is discharging, and that its voltage is, for instance, 3.7V; assume now that, at this stage, an external unpredictable energy source becomes available. Should this fact be ignored and the battery be allowed to continue discharging until its voltage reaches 3.3V? Or should the battery be recharged while the unpredictable energy source is present? It is clear that the strict maximisation of the battery lifetime implies the sub-optimal use of the harvested energy, and increases the probability of running out of power. On the other hand, any attempt to use as much harvested energy as possible might severely limit the duration of the batteries as a result of uncontrolled charging cycles. To overcome this issue, a software-based solution has been implemented. With access to the actual battery voltage value, a software procedure sets the trip voltage values so that complete discharge cycles can be periodically performed, thus yielding a long battery lifetime, and, simultaneously, good harvesting efficiency. 3.2 Data acquisition platform Targeted to PA applications, our WDAP comprises an analog interface based on a low-power analog-to-digital converter (AD7888BRZ from Analog Devices, USA), featuring eight analog inputs with 12-bit resolution (Fig. 7). External general-purpose sensors supply is accomplished by a separate DC–DC converter that is turned on only during the acquisition process. Data from the power-conditioning subsystem, such as the signals from the energy harvesters and the battery voltage sample value, are handled in a different way. The pulses generated by each power conditioning block comparators’ to control the corresponding boost converter are filtered before the analog-to-digital conversion takes place. This is done with an RC filter at the output of a low-power 4:1 multiplexer. The sampled battery voltage is taken by a separate analog channel, through a voltage divider enabled by an analog switch to save energy. 4 Experimental results The energy harvesting methods were evaluated in two different devices (the -S and -Z variants, shown in Fig. 10 ). A MPWiNodeS device was installed outside our laboratory with the purpose of sending periodically solar irradiance, relative humidity, outside temperature and battery voltage data to a base station. This device is being used in a long-term evaluation of the proposed WDAP. Other similar device was used in the laboratory to an in-depth analysis of the power-conditioning subsystem waveforms. On the other hand, a MPWiNodeZ device was deployed in a vineyard as a ZigBee network node to evaluate, in-field, the energy harvesters performance (Fig. 11 ). The performance of the wind turbine was evaluated using a wind tunnel (4 m length, 0.4 m × 0.4 m cross-sectional area). Fig. 12 shows the relevant waveforms obtained with the correspondent power-conditioning block. The pulsed output was filtered to extract its DC value, yielding V ¯ PULSE,WIND . This evaluation was performed at various air speed values which has lead to the transfer function of Fig. 12. As can be seen, V ¯ PULSE,WIND is proportional to wind speed, the linearised transfer function being approximately given by (4) wind velocity = 1 118.3 V ¯ PULSE,WIND + 2.15 ( m/s ) , where V ¯ PULSE,WIND is in mV. For speeds below approximately 2.1 m/s the voltage output from the turbine is not enough ( V WIND < 2 V) for turning on the boost converter, which indicates that this speed value is the minimum value that enables battery charging (as well as data from wind speed). As expected, the extracted electrical power (measured directly on the generator with a resistive load), follows a cubic-law, accordingly to (1). Fig. 13 shows the behaviour of the hydrogenerator power-conditioning block. To illustrate the start charging procedure, the F / C ¯ signal is asserted low to select the charging mode. Until that, the hydrogenerator was operating without any electrical load. As can be seen, the battery starts charging and the power-conditioning block maintains the hydrogenerator working at its MPP (approximately at 1.5 V), by means of the SHDN ¯ HYDRO signal. For the field evaluation of the MPWiNodeS device, eight sensors were used for measuring air temperature (LM50B from National Semiconductor, USA), solar radiation (TSL230 and TSL251 from Texas Instruments, USA) and air relative humidity (HIH-3610 from Honeywell, USA) for creating a discharging profile and measure current consumption. In addition, data from solar radiation (obtained from the solar panel), wind speed (obtained from the wind turbine) and from battery were also transmitted to the base station for posterior analysis. The operation mode was deliberately set to be a relatively high duty-cycle, 10 s in a 60s time-frame (16.7%). To get quicker results, a battery with a lower capacity (220mAh) was used. The result of this evaluation period, regarding the battery behaviour, is shown in Fig. 14 where solar irradiance is also shown. The evaluation was performed over a period of variable weather (cloudy, foggy and bright, winter days). It can be seen that the battery stop charging control has keeping the battery voltage below 4.2 V, although it would be possible to go beyond that value. The MPWiNodeZ device, as a ZigBee network router, was also evaluated. Table 2 summarises the obtained results. By gathering data from V ¯ PULSE,SP and from the TSL230 solar radiation sensor, the transfer function illustrated in Fig. 15 was obtained. 5 Conclusions and final remarks In principle, the energy required to permanently operate the wireless data acquisition nodes and routers in a large sensor network can be obtained by harvesting energy sources present in the environment. Our multi-powered platform was designed for applications in precision agriculture, and focuses on solar and kinetic energy sources (wind and water in pipes). The system that we built proves that the three harvesting methods suffice to supply a generic WDAP energy store. Even with low values of solar radiation, the combination of the three energy sources has supplied an energy of about 58 mAh, more than the 39mAh required by network routers. We have observed that the wind turbine is able to generate an important fraction of the harvested energy, in certain cases close to the needs of router nodes. Improving these generators may pay off in the future, particularly in applications where irrigation pipes are absent. At the opposite extreme one finds applications in greenhouses, hydroponic or aquaculture systems, in which case the wind is unlikely to play a major role but moving water in pipes is abundant, reversing the relative importance of wind turbines and hydro-generators. Another novelty of our approach is the double functionality of the power management block, which in addition to its usual role also doubles as a sensing device for the parameters that are usually monitored in agricultural environments. Our results and in particular Figs. 15 and 16 confirm that a coarse value of wind speed and solar irradiance can be measured by the corresponding energy harvester without the need for specific sensors. This is yet another advantage of the idea of harvesting from multiple energy sources: when the energy sources are related to parameters that the sensor network needs to measure, the amount of harvested energy may itself yield an estimate of the parameter, making conventional sensors unnecessary. Several improvements to the basic ideas underlying this paper are possible, some of which are presently under study. The system could for example keep a record of each harvested energy source, and use it to predict its future availability. The use of Lithium batteries and ultracapacitors is also being evaluated as a way to slow down battery aging by absorbing the transient power and to minimise the issue described in Section 3.1.3.

When observing a high frame rate sequence, it becomes noticeable that a great percentage of the frames' pixels values do not suffer great changes along the sequence. Hence, if a pixel's value remains the same, then a unique sample is enough to represent that particular pixel over several frames. Only pixels that suffer great variations require a higher number of samples to be correctly represented. This work reports a methodology that combines compression and reconstruction techniques to evaluate an alternative to the traditional compression methods 25/30 fps. In the proposed method, sets of pixels are extracted along the temporal direction and by exploiting the high temporal correlation of the signals, a proper decimation process is applied in order to create a sequence with a lower number of frames and consequently smaller file size. The main objective is to propose a new compression methodology that will take advantage of the signal characteristics using both compression and reconstruction techniques. ©2007 IEEE.",

Keywords Microsystem Electrical resistivity sensor Wireless interface Estrus prediction 1 Introduction Monitoring progesterone levels in milk is an effective method not only for predicting ovulation, and thus time to artificial insemination, but also for detecting pregnancy and fertility problems. Laboratorial measurements, based on radio-immunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodology, have allowed estrus detection with 98% specificity, but these methods require time and specific skills [1]. Several approaches have been developed by researchers to determine progesterone in milk and blood [2–4]. Other studies have shown that electrical impedance in vaginal mucus may be used to pinpoint proper insemination time [5]. Decreasing electrical resistance (ER) values were always associated with the onset of estrus. Nevertheless it should be kept in mind that vulvar ER measurements vary among cows. A suitable solution should monitor the relative changes within cows during the estrus cycle. Once the ER readings begin to decline, the cow should be probed more frequently until the lowest reading is obtained. Complementary to the ER variation during the estrus cycle, a temperature variation is also present and can be correlated. It has been reported that 12 h before ovulation the vaginal temperature increase from 37.94 ± 0.33 to 39.00 ± 0.64 ° C, as compared to the pre-estrus value [6]. It was also reported that the prediction of estrus based on vaginal temperature was excellent when an increase of at least 0.4 ° C in vagina temperature was observed for 3 or more consecutive hours [7]. The combination between these two parameters not only allows a greater specificity in prediction, but enables the conception of a complete and autonomous microsystem for ER and body temperature measurements, suitable to be implanted in the cow vulvar muscle. To achieve this purpose some key issues have been specially addressed: measurement methods, data transfer, power consumption and package (or encapsulation). System conception and measurement methods are presented. 2 System overview The specificity of the proposed methodology dictates that size and type of encapsulation is a major concern. For a reliable and long-term operation, the device must be small, bio-compatible and power-efficient. Regarding energy consumption, data transfer is accomplished by using a highly efficient RF-transmitter operating in class-E mode to transfer small data packets every hour to a receiver device located in the cow collar. Issues concerning data exchange with a collecting and/or processing station are not discussed here. Sensor implementation for measuring ER is based on a four-point electrode arrangement which consists of outer-current injecting electrodes and inner-voltage measurement electrodes with the same separation distance between every electrode. This arrangement is called Wenner alpha type, which has been modified to allow measurements using four conductive strips in the perimeter of the package, as depicted in Fig. 1 . In a Wenner structure, two electrodes (A and B) are used to create a current that flows away from or towards each electrode across the surface. The total potential difference between the electrodes M and N is given by [8]: (1) V MN = V M − V N = ρ I 2 π 1 AM ¯ − 1 MB ¯ − 1 AN ¯ − 1 NB ¯ where ρ represents the surface resistivity ( Ω m) and I is the current (A) that flows between electrodes A and B. Eq. () may be rearranged to yield: (2) V MN = ρ I K where (3) K ≡ 2 π 1 AM ¯ − 1 MB ¯ − 1 AN ¯ − 1 NB ¯ − 1 is the “geometric factor” that will acquire a particular value for a given electrode spacing. For the Wenner array, all of the separations are equal to a constant value a and the Wenner geometric factor assumes the simple form K = 2 π a . Thus, the apparent resistivity is (4) ρ = V MN I K By knowing the injected current value I, ER variations can be accomplished by measuring the potential difference V MN at the inner electrodes. Temperature variations are detected by using a precision temperature sensor, thermally connected to a metal strip outside the capsule (fifth strip in Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows a simplified block diagram of the entire system. The excitation block, basically a sine-step current source, generates an ac current that flows through outer electrodes A and B. The measurement block is responsible for analog multiplexing and for analog-to-digital conversion. The core of this block is a second-order delta–sigma ( Δ Σ ) modulator, implemented in a fully differential topology using switched-capacitor techniques. The output of the Δ Σ modulator (bitstream) is then applied to a first-order digital filter to provide a 14-bit word. The associated control logic is responsible for controlling the analog multiplexer and for digital word synchronization, regarding the temperature sensor and potential difference samples. For data transmission, digital samples are assembled in a frame containing ID, preamble and checksum control fields. Prior to transmission, data is encoded as a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal and then transmitted, by means of amplitude shift-keying (ASK) modulation, through a power amplifier operating at 433.92 MHz ISM band in class-E mode. The RF frequency is generated by an on-chip frequency synthesizer based on a 13.56 MHz crystal. The temperature sensor, developed in a previous work [9], is a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) circuit with bipolar devices fabricated in the CMOS process. It uses a dynamic PTAT voltage generator with thirty two switching stages using dynamic element matching and dynamic amplification techniques to achieve a high-performance temperature sensor with high accuracy (better than 0.1%) and high resolution (better than 0.05 ° C, typical 0.01 ° C). 3 Electrical bio-impedance One of the classic signs of estrus in cows is a swollen vulva. Such swelling is the result of changes in tissue hydration, which causes changes in ER [10]. Changes in cell density, fluid volume, and electrolyte content of bovine vulvar tissue can be accomplished by considering the living tissue as an electrical circuit. The simplified circuit used to simulate electrical properties of a biological subject includes parallel resistance R e (extracellular space resistance) to serially connected R i (intracellular space resistance) with C m (membrane capacitance), as depicted in Fig. 3 . To determine tissue water and composition a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) technique is used. This technique is an assessment of changes in a biological object reflected by the capacitive reactance, resistance, and other factors for an indication of any alteration in the tissue composition. 4 Measurement methods The biological object impedance is measured by injecting a small alternating current, i ext ( t ) , of constant amplitude at a fixed frequency through the tissue by using two electrodes. The current injection develops a voltage distribution on the periphery of the tissue, related to the impedance distribution of the interior, which is measured using two adjacent electrodes. This voltage drop, v ( t ) , can be seen as the product of Z ˙ X times i ext ( t ) , as depicted in Fig. 4 . A shift in the phase angle between the injected current and the measured voltage drop defines reactance or a complex impedance measurement including the dielectric non-conducting space attributed to cell membrane capacitance. In clinical practice, and for most of the numerous experiments published in the literature [11], the BIA measurements are conduced using a four-electrode, or tetrapolar, method with a fixed frequency of about 50 kHz. The reason for this value is that it reduces electrode polarization anomalies and it ideally cancels the influence of the electrode–electrolyte interface impedance [12]. 4.1 Excitation circuit To efficiently measure ac impedance, an integrated sinusoidal current source is needed. Most sine current generators are based on a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), which requires a read-only memory (ROM) sine look-up table and a current-mode digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This solution requires a large integration area since waveform generation is closely related to the ROM size and the DAC resolution. Instead of using such approach a set of precisely scaled current mirrors can be used to produce sine steps as depicted in Fig. 5 . Switches S0 to S5 are turned ON by an up/down counter to produce a half-sine wave, where individual current mirrors ( M 2 , 0 , … , M 2 , 5 ) have been calculated to perform an accurate sine current step. Excitation current i ext ( t ) (equivalent to a rectified sine waveform) is then mirrored by a wide swing cascade current mirror (M5, M6) and transformed to a full wave by the switching network formed by switches SA, SB, SC and SD. The reference current I REF is generated by a bandgap reference circuit and can be adjusted externally during prototype evaluation. 4.2 Measurement circuit Voltage drop at the inner electrodes of the array is characterized by its amplitude (real part of the measured impedance) and the phase shift between the injected current and the measured voltage. Both values must be acquired to calculate the value of the complex impedance Z ˙ X . The amplitude measurement is based on two peak detectors that detect and hold the minimum and the maximum values of the difference between signals at the measuring electrodes, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Due to the switching action of the excitation circuit, the voltage across Z ˙ X appears with some induced glitches caused by SA, SB, SC and SD. Because of this, two first-order gm-C filters are used before the difference amplifier. This type of filter, where gm cells replace resistors, offers several advantages for this application such as low-area, low-power and more accurate integrated filters. The difference amplifier has a fixed gain of five and has been designed using switched-capacitor techniques. The output dc level has been set to the common-mode voltage of the fully differential Δ Σ modulator, allowing both peak detectors to operate within the input dynamic range of the modulator. It should be kept in mind that the use of the minimum peak detector, whose output value is theoretically the opposite of the maximum value, doubles the signal dynamic range and enables the use of fully differential structures. Advantages of using fully differential topologies, such as the case of the Δ Σ modulator, are the reduction of the common-mode interference, switch charge injection and clock feedthrough. Also, and since we are only interested in the amplitude of the measured waveform, the usage of both peak detectors reduces substantially the bandwidth requirements of the Δ Σ modulator. Phase shift between the applied sine wave and the obtained signal is measured through a phase detector that consists of a differential pair and a comparator, as basically depicted in Fig. 7 . The output of the comparator is then applied to a counter clocked by the same clock signal of the Δ Σ modulator to estimate pulse-width T p . While one of the inputs is tied to electrodes dc level ( V CM ), the other is connected to one of the active electrodes. When opening switch SA (see Fig. 5) and closing SB, the input V 1 surges over V CM due to the capacitive effect of the complex impedance. With this circuit, the duration of the pulse produced by the comparator is proportional to the phase shift of the Z ˙ X impedance. However, and as stated in [13], due to the use of a medium frequency (50 kHz, for example), the capacitive part of the complex impedance can be neglected. Nevertheless, and for future experiments in accessing tissue composition, this block will be integrated as a part of the measuring circuit. 5 Data transfer and encapsulation For a feasible operation and continuous surveillance of a cow, the proposed device must remain permanently on the proper anatomical location for the duration of the animal’s productive life. One of the requirements dictates that all subsystems must follow low-power and low-voltage design guidelines. In every radio-frequency device, power consumption during transmissions is a major parcel in power budget, even in highly efficient transmitters. To minimize this restriction, as well as power consumption regarding computational power, data is transmitted to a receiver unit located in a cow collar for further processing. Considering that a receiver is also included, a significant improvement in device lifetime can be achieved since measured data is only needed during the cow estrus cycle. So, data transfer can occur in a dynamic way to reduce power consumption during the times that monitoring is not needed, such as when the cow is pregnant. This is controlled by the receiver unit that issues an interrogation command that wakes up the device, which responds with a data frame and immediately enters in sleep mode. Interrogation commands are issued at a frequency dictated by the cow’s estrus cycle starting with a 12-h period and achieving a 1-h period when tracking minimum ER and maximum temperature values. The receiver unit, besides device interrogation function, is also responsible for data exchange within a wireless mesh-topology network, such as ZigBee ™ . On the other hand, a proper encapsulation must be addressed to ensure that after the device is implanted it presents no discomfort to the animal. To avoid tissue damage or electrode degradation, the electrodes are made with stainless steel (noble metals such as Pt or Au can also be used). The electrodes are located outside the plastic capsule, containing in its interior a Li-ion battery and the antenna. After assembly, the package can be hermetically sealed. 6 Results To fulfill the requirements of a fully autonomous implantable capsule, several subsystems are being designed, simulated and tested. For this prototype, a macrodevice, regarding the measuring method, has been built to validate the proposed methodology. Simulations were performed in T-Spice from Tanner Tools using the SPICE typical models from the AMI C07M-A CMOS process, available through Europractice program. The simulated voltages present at the measuring electrodes M and N are shown in Fig. 8 . This simulation corresponds to an alternating current of approximately 52 kHz. Fig. 9 shows the difference between the voltages present at the measuring electrodes, illustrating the sine step current. Voltages at the measuring electrodes, V M and V N , are then individually applied to a first-order gm-C filter and the result is applied to the difference amplifier. Fig. 10 shows the simulated response of the two peak detectors fed by the output of the amplifier. To simulate the behavior of the implantable capsule, some plastic cylinders with the four-electrode array have been built with different electrode separations, as depicted in Fig. 11 . The materials used (PVC for the cylinder and stainless steel for the electrodes) were specifically chosen to ensure biocompatibility. In order to keep the electrodes in place, a small chamfer was carved around the external side of the cylinder. All electrical connections were made on the inside of the cylinder, which was then filled with a non-conductive glue. To simulate the electrical conductivity of the vaginal mucus, each capsule was then placed in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (0.08 mol L−1 at 23 ° C). At this stage, capsule evaluation was performed by a macrodevice, Fig. 12 , where discrete electronic components were employed to generate a sine step current source. This macrodevice, beside the current source, filters and peak detectors, has a 14-bit analog-to-digital converter, a microcontroller and a RS232 driver to acquire and transfer collected data to a laptop computer for posterior analysis. Fig. 13 shows the results of some measurements. Fig. 13 shows the injected sine wave corresponding to an ac current of amplitude of approximately 660 μ A RMS (933 μ A peak ) and frequency of 52 kHz. The waveforms at both outputs of the amplifier and peak detector are shown in Fig. 13(minimum not shown). The peak detector output indicates a value of 921 mV (gain of the amplifier was set to 10), which is consistent with a 100 Ω resistance measurement. In fact, for a specific capsule with its particular cell constant value, the result is the inverse of the measured conductance, which was 9.8 mS. The inverse of the conductance is the resistance leading to a measured value of 102 Ω . 7 Conclusions The preliminary results suggests that the proposed implantable microsystem for vulvar ER and body temperature measurements can fulfill the requirements of a low-cost autonomous system to help estrus prediction in herd management. The major advantage of the presented solution is the capability of continuous monitoring of two correlated parameters in estrus detection during a long period of time without human intervention. A prototype, comprising the excitation and measurement circuits, as well as the RF transmitter, is being implemented in a standard CMOS 0.7 μ m mixed-signal process (AMIS C07M-A) to validate the proposed methodology. Previous implementations [14,9] have shown that the delta–sigma modulator exhibits an effective 16.1-bit resolution (98.7 dB dynamic range) with an 800 Hz bandwidth. The temperature sensor has a 0.05 ° C precision, which is suitable to detect very small variations of temperature, which is also closely associated with the onset of standing estrus and the pre-ovulatory surge in Luteinizing hormone (LH). Another important advantage is related to calibration. Since the proposed capsule will monitor relative changes of temperature and ER during the estrus cycle of different animals, absolute readings are not necessary, thus avoiding calibration of the device. After fabrication of this prototype, a set of long-term experiments will be scheduled to test the reliability of the capsule, which will be at the proper anatomical location of the animal. During this evaluation phase, the prototype will be scaled down to a 3.3 V CMOS process (AMIS C035M-A) to allow a single Li-ion cell as power source. Some improvements are also scheduled such as a receiver to control device shutdown and wake-up modes. To our knowledge, it’s the first time that an implantable capsule with a circular strip Wenner array and a microsystem is used to predict estrus in dairy cows. The key of the proposed measurement method is the correlation of the ER and temperature variation, which have been used separately to predict estrus, each one with a reasonable specificity.

Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 227 Practical implementations are possible up to a certain truncation error, which generally tends to be more of a concern when the kernel has infinite support and slow decay (such as the sinc function). B-splines have compact support, and as a result the value of a certain signal sample cannot influence the reconstruction outside a certain finite interval. The kernel function will often lead to a Riesz sequence or a Riesz basis. Riesz bases are a generalization of orthonormal bases, and can be regarded as the result of applying a bounded invertible operator to the elements of an orthonormal basis. A Riesz sequence, on the other hand is an “incomplete basis,” as it is merely a Riesz basis for the closed linear span of the set of functions under consideration. The numerical stability of the representations is very important in practice, as it dictates the magnitude of the effect of dealing with imperfect data. The stability of Riesz bases and Riesz sequences can be measured by looking at the size of their Riesz bounds. Orthonormal bases are perfect from the viewpoint of numerical stability, and their Riesz bounds are both equal to unity. As the ratio of the upper to the lower bound increases, the numerical stability of the representation decreases. It is well known [3], that the tighter (closer to each other) these bounds are the less any small perturbations in the input data will be felt at the output. This paper points out that the Riesz bounds associated with bases built using certain linear combinations of B-splines are better from the stability point of view than bases directly based on B-splines. The notation used is standard: L 2 is the space of all quadratically Lebesgue integrable f , with norm bardblf bardbl 2 := ( integraltext |f | 2 ) 1/2 and inner product 〈f,g〉:= integraltext fg ∗ . The space lscript 2 is its discrete counterpart (quadratically summable sequences), with the usual norm and inner product. The Fourier transform ˆ f of f is ˆ f(w)= ∞ integraldisplay −∞ f(t)e −jwt dt, implying an inverse given by f(t)= 1 2π ∞ integraldisplay −∞ ˆ f(w)e jwt dw. Section 2 provides the necessary background and describes the kernels used, and Section 3 deals with the stability issues. The spaces V ϕ generated by the kernels are discussed in Section 4, and the analysis filters are computed in Section 5. 2. The general sampling scheme It is well known that substitution of the sinc kernel by other functions more adjusted to the specific problem considered may lead to better approximations [4–6]. B-splines are a possibility, and their advantages are well known [2]. Consider the signal space [7] V ϕ := braceleftbigg f(t)= summationdisplay c k ϕ(t − k): c k ∈ l 2 bracerightbigg , k∈Z 228 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 Fig. 1. Typical sampling scheme. Usually, the analysis and synthesis filters are low-pass, i.e., h(t) = ϕ(t) = sinc(t),forT = 1. In the general case they must satisfy the bi-orthogonality condition 〈ϕ(t −k),ϕ ◦ (t −l)〉=δ k−l . where we have chosen the sampling step T = 1. When the function ϕ generates a Riesz basis, the coefficients c k completely characterize the signal. When ϕ is the sinc function, the coefficients c k are essentially the signal samples, but in the more general case they are given by the inner product between f and ϕ ◦ k , i.e., c k =〈f,ϕ ◦ k 〉. See Fig. 1. The family {ϕ ◦ k } is dual to {ϕ k } and its Fourier transform is given by [8] ˆ ϕ ◦ (w) = ˆϕ(w) summationtext k∈Z |ˆϕ(w + 2πk)| 2 . (1) In the least squares sense this means that P V ϕ f = summationdisplay k∈Z angbracketleftbig f,ϕ ◦ k angbracketrightbig ϕ k , where P V ϕ f denotes the projection of f in V ϕ . Butzer et al. [9] studied interpolation and approximation problems in which the sinc kernel is replaced by certain interpolation functions ϕ i with compact support, among which the following will be relevant for us: ϕ 1 (t) = M 2 (t), ϕ 2 (t) = 4M 3 (t) − 3M 4 (t), ϕ 6 (t) = M 4 (t) + 1 3 M 2 (t) − 1 6 parenleftbig M 2 (t + 1) + M 2 (t − 1) parenrightbig , ϕ 7 (t) = 4M 4 (t) + 1 2 parenleftbig M 4 (t + 1) + M 4 (t − 1) parenrightbig − 2 parenleftbig M 5 (t + 1/2) + M 5 (t − 1/2) parenrightbig . These interpolating kernels are linear combinations of the B-splines defined by M n (t) = braceleftbigg summationtext ceilingleftn/2−|t|ceilingright j=0 (−1) j n(n/2−|t|−j) n−1 j!(n−j)! , |t|lessorequalslantn/2, 0, |t| >n/2, where ceilingleftxceilingright denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x. They can also be represented in terms of their Fourier transforms ˆ M n (w) = bracketleftbigg sinw/2 w/2 bracketrightbigg n ,w∈ R. Plots are shown in Fig. 2. M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 229 Fig. 2. Interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 ,andϕ 7 . Although Butzer et al. have discussed a wider class of functions, here we use only those with the interpolation property (see Ref. [9] for details). 3. Stability and Riesz bounds The set of integer translations of a B-spline generates a Riesz basis. In fact, the following result holds [10]. Theorem 1. For any function φ ∈ L 2 (R) and constants 0 <αlessorequalslantβ<∞ the following two statements are equivalent: (i) {φ(·−k): k ∈ Z} satisfies the Riesz condition with Riesz bounds α and β; that is, for any {c k }∈l 2 , α summationdisplay k∈Z |c k | 2 lessorequalslant vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble summationdisplay k∈Z c k φ(·−k) vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble 2 2 lessorequalslantβ summationdisplay k∈Z |c k | 2 . (ii) The Fourier transform ˆ φ of φ satisfies α lessorequalslant summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ φ(w + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 lessorequalslantβ, almost everywhere. The Riesz bounds corresponding to the B-splines and the linear combinations of B- splines used by Butzer et al. can now be found. Setting w = 2x and φ(w)= M n (w) we see 230 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 that summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M n (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle sin[(2x + 2πk)/2] (2x + 2πk)/2 vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle 2n = summationdisplay k∈Z sin 2n (x + πk) (x + πk) 2n = sin 2n x summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + πk) 2n , wherewehaveusedsin 2n (x + πk)= sin 2n x. It is known [11] that summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + πk) 2n =− 1 (2n − 1)! d 2n−1 dx 2n−1 cotx, which immediately yields summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M n (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 2n x (2n − 1)! d 2n−1 dx 2n−1 cotx. (2) Now, with the help of (2), we find for M 1 ˜ f 1 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 1 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 2 x (2 − 1)! d 2−1 dx 2−1 cotx = 1, (3) that is, α = β = 1. For M 2 we have ˜ f 2 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 2 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 4 x 3! d 3 dx 3 cotx = 1 3 parenleftbig 1 + 2 cos 2 x parenrightbig . (4) This equation has its minimum 1/3atx = π/2(orw = π), and its maximum 1 at x = w = 0, i.e., α = 1/3 and β = 1. Inthesameway, ˜ f 3 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 3 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 6 x 5! d 5 dx 5 cotx = 1 15 parenleftbig 2 + 11 cos 2 x + 2 cos 4 x parenrightbig . (5) The minimum is α = 2/15 and the maximum is β = 1. As for M 4 , we see that ˜ f 4 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 4 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 8 x 7! d 7 dx 7 cotx = 1 315 parenleftbig 17 + 180 cos 2 x + 114 cos 4 x + 4 cos 6 x parenrightbig , (6) yielding α = 17/315 and β = 1. M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 231 Finally, for M 5 we have ˜ f 5 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 5 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 10 x 9! d 10 dx 10 cotx = 1 2835 braceleftbig 62 + 1072 cos 2 x + 1452 cos 4 x + 247 cos 6 x + 7 cos 8 x bracerightbig , (7) showing that α = 62/2835 and β = 1. Figure 3 shows the plots of ˜ f 1 , ˜ f 2 , ˜ f 3 , ˜ f 4 , ˜ f 5 defined by (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), respectively. Table 1 presents a summary of these bounds. Fig. 3.

Plot of the periodic functions ˜ φ 1 , ˜ φ 2 , ˜ φ 6 ,and ˜ φ 7 , associated to the Riesz bases generated by the ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 ,andϕ 7 . To investigate the bounds associated with ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 we observe that, for odd integers p and q, summationdisplay k∈Z sin p (x + πk) (x + πk) p = sin p x braceleftbigg summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + 2kπ) p − summationdisplay k∈Z 1 [x + (2k + 1)π] p bracerightbigg , (8) and summationdisplay k∈Z cos q (x + πk)sin p (x + πk) (x + πk) p = cos q x sin p x braceleftbigg summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + 2kπ) p + summationdisplay k∈Z 1 [x + (2k + 1)π] p bracerightbigg .

With the help of (8) and (9) we get ˜ φ 2 (x) = 41 70 + 191 210 cos 2 x − 121 210 cos 4 x + 17 210 cos 6 x, (11) ˜ φ 6 (x) = 359 945 + 48 35 cos 2 x − 278 315 cos 4 x + 124 945 cos 6 x, (12) ˜ φ 7 (x) = 17 35 + 4016 2835 cos 2 x − 566 405 cos 4 x + 116 189 cos 6 x 368 8 32 10 − 2835 cos x + 2835 cos x. (13) M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 233 Figure 4 shows the plots of ˜ φ 1 , ˜ φ 2 , ˜ φ 6 , and ˜ φ 7 defined by (10), (11), (12), and (13), respectively. Note that the largest variation, 1 − α 1 ≈ 0.667, occurs for ˜ φ 1 and the smallest 1 − α 2 ≈ 0.414 for ˜ φ 2 . Table 1 summarizes the bounds, and shows that the linear combinations of B-splines ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 , lead to more stable representations than the B-splines M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , M 4 , and M 5 for equivalent polynomial spaces. Compare, for example, the bounds associated with M 5 and ϕ 7 , both of the 4th degree. 4. The spaces V ϕ Suppose that the spaces V a and V b are generated by ϕ a and ϕ b , respectively. It is known [3] that when the Riesz bounds of V a are tighter than those of V b , the representations pro- duced in V a are numerically more stable. This statement is clear when ϕ a and ϕ b generate the same space, i.e., V a = V b . In the more general case V a negationslash= V b the comparison is less straightforward. This will now be discussed. We note that already in [7] the authors considered the spaces generated by integer trans- lations of a generating function ϕ a , and linear combinations of the translations of the same generating function (what the authors call equivalent basis functions). Generally, when the sampling set T approaches zero, the approximation error bardblf − P V T f bardbl decreases. The Strang–Fix conditions [12] relate the approximation power of the representation to the spectral characteristics of the generating function: bardblf − P V T f bardbllessorequalslantC L T L bardblf (L) bardbl, ∀f ∈ W L 2 , where C L is a known constant and bardblf (L) bardbl= parenleftBigg 1 2π ∞ integraldisplay −∞ w 2L vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ f(w) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 parenrightBigg 1/2 . Here, W L 2 denotes the space of functions that are L times differentiable in the L 2 or finite- energy sense, and P V T f , as before, the orthogonal projection of f into V T . The error will decay like O(T L ), where the order of approximation is L = n + 1, and n the polyno- mial degree. Spline interpolation gives an identical error of approximation but a larger C L constant [13,14]. In our case, the spaces V ϕ ⊂ L 2 formed from the M i are all disjoint (the constant func- tion is not in L 2 ). Hence, they do not intersect and are not a subset of each other (for example, we cannot say that V M 1 ⊂ V M 2 or vice-versa). For ϕ 1 we have that ϕ 1 (t) = M 1 (t), that is, the spaces generated from the translations set of ϕ 1 and M 1 are equivalent, i.e., V ϕ 1 ≡ V M 1 . Now, suppose that ψ(t)= αM 3 (t) + βM 4 (t), for some fixed reals α and β. Suppose that for these values of α and β the Riesz bounds are better for V ψ than for V M 3 and V M 4 . Consider the projection of a signal f ∈ L 2 in V M 3 , V M 4 , and V ψ . Controlling T leads to approximations as good as necessary, but the representation in V ψ will remain the most stable. This is also the case when α = 4 and β =−3, that is, the approximation of a signal f ∈ L 2 will be numerically better in V ϕ 2 than in V M 3 or V M 4 . 234 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 A similar argument can be applied to the representations produced by the projections into V ϕ 6 , which are found to be more stable than the ones in V M 2 and V M 4 .Thesameis true for V ϕ 7 , in this case with respect to V M 4 and V M 5 . 5. The dual bases To complete this study, and in reference to Fig. 1, it remains to describe the dual func- tions of the interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 . For the B-splines, and according to (1), we find ˆ M ◦ 1 (w) = 2sin w 2 w , ˆ M ◦ 2 (w) = 12(1 − cos 2 w 2 ) w 2 (1 + 2 cos 2 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 3 (w) = 120 sin w 2 (1 − cos 2 w 2 ) w 3 (2 + 11 cos 2 w 2 + 2 cos 4 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 4 (w) = 5040(1 − 2 cos 2 w 2 + cos 4 w 2 ) w 4 (17 + 180 cos 2 w 2 + 114 cos 4 w 2 + 4 cos 6 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 5 (w) = 90720 sin w 2 (1 − 2 cos 2 w 2 + cos 4 w 2 ) w 5 (62 + 1072 cos 2 w 2 + 1452 cos 4 w 2 + 247 cos 6 w 2 + 7 cos 8 w 2 ) . (14) See Fig. 5 for plots. As for the interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 we find Fig. 5.

(15) See Fig. 6. The expressions (14) and (15) define the frequency response of each analysis filter, or pre-filter, completing the framework of Fig. 1. 6. Conclusions For all practical purposes, signal representation procedures must be stable under small perturbations in the input data, and sometimes it is also desirable that the support of the interpolating kernel be as small as possible. This limits the truncation error, since only a 236 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 few coefficients contribute to the representation at any given point. The kernels that have been discussed meet both conditions. In the context of the sampling scheme described in [7], certain linear combinations of B-splines, already studied in a different context [9], lead to representations with tighter Riesz bounds than those generated by B-splines alone. Numerically, they therefore lead to more stable representations. References [1] C. de Boor, A Practical Guide to Splines, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978. [2] M.

The advantages of B-splines for signal representation are well known. This paper explores a fact that seems to be less well known, namely, the possibility of using linear combinations of B-splines to obtain representations that are more stable than the usual ones. We give the best possible Riesz bounds for these linear combinations and calculate their duals, in a generalized sampling context.
