Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Voicing contrast is hard to master during speech motor development, and the phonological process of consonant devoicing is very frequent in children with Speech Sound Disorders (SSD). Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise the oral and laryngeal articulation control strategies used by children with and without SSD as a function of place of articulation. The articulation rate and relative oral airflow amplitude (flow) were used to analyse how children controlled oral articulation; fundamental frequency (fo), open quotient (OQ), and a classification of voicing were used to explore laryngeal behaviour. Data from detailed speech and language assessments, oral air-flow and electroglottography signals were collected from 13 children with SSD and 17 children without SSD, aged 5;0 to 7;8, using picture naming tasks. Articulation rate and flow in children with and without SSD were not significantly different, but a statistically reliable effect of place on flow was found. Children with and without SSD used different relative fo (which captures changes in fo during the consonant-vowel transition) and OQ values, and place of articulation had an effect on the strength of voicing. All children used very similar oral articulation control of voicing, but children with SSD used less efficient laryngeal articulation strategies (higher subglottal damping and more air from the lungs expelled in each glottal cycle) than children without SSD.",

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: We require high-quality information on the current burden, the types of therapy and resources available, methods of delivery, care pathways and long-term outcomes for people with aphasia. Aim: To document and inform international delivery of post-stroke aphasia treatment, to optimise recovery and reintegration of people with aphasia. Methods & Procedures: Multi-centre, prospective, non-randomised, open study, employing blinded outcome assessment, where appropriate, including people with post-stroke aphasia, able to attend for 30 minutes during the initial language assessment, at first contact with a speech and language therapist for assessment of aphasia at participating sites. There is no study-mandated intervention. Assessments will occur at baseline (first contact with a speech and language therapist for aphasia assessment), discharge from Speech and Language Therapy (SLT), 6 and 12-months post-stroke. Our primary outcome is changed from baseline in the Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT/Scenario Test for participants with severe verbal impairments) at 12-months post-stroke. Secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 months include the Therapy Outcome Measure (TOMS), Subjective Index of Physical and Social Outcome (SIPSO), Aphasia Severity Rating Scale (ASRS), Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient (WAB-AQ), stroke and aphasia quality of life scale (SAQoL-39), European Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D), lesion description, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), resource use, and satisfaction with therapy provision and success. We will collect demography, clinical data, and therapy content. Routine neuroimaging and medication administration records will be accessed where possible; imaging will be pseudonymised and transferred to a central reading centre. Data will be collected in a central registry. We will describe demography, stroke and aphasia profiles and therapies available. International individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses will examine treatment responder rates based on minimal detectable change & clinically important changes from baseline for primary and secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 months. Multivariable meta-analyses will examine associations between demography, therapy, medication use and outcomes, considering service characteristics. Where feasible, costs associated with treatment will be reported. Where available, we will detail brain lesion size and site, and examine correlations with SLT and language outcome at 12 months. Conclusion: International differences in care, resource utilisation and outcomes will highlight avenues for further aphasia research, promote knowledge sharing and optimise aphasia rehabilitation delivery. IPD meta-analyses will enhance and expand understanding, identifying cost-effective and promising approaches to optimise rehabilitation to benefit people with aphasia.",

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Coordination of international aphasia research would minimise duplication of effort, support synergistic international activities across languages and multidisciplinary perspectives, and promote high-quality conduct and reporting of aphasia research, thereby increasing the relevance, transparency, and implementation of findings. The Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists (CATs) sought to develop an aphasia research agenda to direct future research activities, based on priorities shared by people with aphasia, family members, and healthcare professionals. Our established international research network spanning 33 countries contributed to this activity. Research literature reporting the priorities of stakeholders was reviewed and synthesized (phase 1). Representatives from Working Groups on Aphasia Assessment & Outcomes, Prognosis & Predictors of Recovery, Effectiveness of Interventions, and Societal Impact & Reintegration participated in a two-day research agenda-setting meeting. The CATs expert panel refined research objectives and identified constituent components of research and methodological developments required to address these research components. The objectives and research components were grouped into overarching themes (phase 2). The resultant list was then circulated to more than 180 CATs members for review, revision, and approval. Consensus on the final aphasia research agenda and roadmap was reached by CATs executive committee (phase 3). The expert panel identified five overarching research themes: (i) evidence-based interventions for people with aphasia, (ii) effective interventions to support those communicating with people with aphasia, (iii) cross-linguistic assessment and core outcomes for aphasia research, (iv) predictors of language recovery, and (v) clinical implementation of research findings. Within these broad themes, 30 research objectives and 91 individual aphasia research components were identified and sequentially ordered. This agenda builds on research priorities identified by people with aphasia and their families, and includes priorities of healthcare professionals and researchers, and will support the rehabilitation and recovery of people with aphasia. Our internationally relevant research agenda promotes rigor in methodology, considers international applicability, synergistic activities, and sharing of resources and expertise.",

Stroke is published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The factors associated with recovery of language domains after stroke remain uncertain. We described recovery of overall-language-ability, auditory comprehension, naming, and functional-communication across participants’ age, sex, and aphasia chronicity in a large, multilingual, international aphasia dataset. METHODS: Individual participant data meta-analysis of systematically sourced aphasia datasets described overall-language ability using the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia-Quotient; auditory comprehension by Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT) Token Test; naming by Boston Naming Test and functional-communication by AAT Spontaneous-Speech Communication subscale. Multivariable analyses regressed absolute score-changes from baseline across language domains onto covariates identified a priori in randomized controlled trials and all study types. Change-from-baseline scores were presented as estimates of means and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was described using relative variance. Risk of bias was considered at dataset and meta-analysis level. RESULTS: Assessments at baseline (median=43.6 weeks poststroke; interquartile range [4–165.1]) and first-follow-up (median=10 weeks from baseline; interquartile range [3–26]) were available for n=943 on overall-language ability, n=1056 on auditory comprehension, n=791 on naming and n=974 on functional-communication. Younger age (<55 years, +15.4 Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia-Quotient points [CI, 10.0–20.9], +6.1 correct on AAT Token Test [CI, 3.2–8.9]; +9.3 Boston Naming Test points [CI, 4.7–13.9]; +0.8 AAT Spontaneous-Speech Communication subscale points [CI, 0.5–1.0]) and enrollment <1 month post-onset (+19.1 Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia-Quotient points [CI, 13.9–24.4]; +5.3 correct on AAT Token Test [CI, 1.7–8.8]; +11.1 Boston Naming Test points [CI, 5.7–16.5]; and +1.1 AAT Spontaneous-Speech Communication subscale point [CI, 0.7–1.4]) conferred the greatest absolute change-from-baseline across each language domain. Improvements in language scores from baseline diminished with increasing age and aphasia chronicity. Data exhibited no significant statistical heterogeneity. Risk-of-bias was low to moderate-low. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier intervention for poststroke aphasia was crucial to maximize language recovery across a range of language domains, although recovery continued to be observed to a lesser extent beyond 6 months poststroke.",

Method: The search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using a protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019139973). Randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in individuals older than 65 years at risk for aspiration, published between January 2002 and July 2019 and written in English, were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality of studies using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Results: Thirteen out of 703 articles identified met the eligibility criteria and were included. Six studies focused on pharmacological interventions, three studies focused on dietary interventions and compensatory strategies, one study focused on oral care, two studies focused on multidisciplinary interventions, and one study assessed a screening method. Four studies showed positive and statistically significant effect in reducing aspiration pneumonia but were considered to have unclear or high risk of bias. Three studies showed promising results on the preventive effect of pharmacological interventions. Conclusions: The most recent evidence on the prevention of aspiration pneumonia in older adults revealed modest to poor methodological quality. Given the burden of aspiration pneumonia on patients and on the health care systems, the development of larger well-designed trials on this topic is of undoubted importance.",

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a standardised protocol for voice assessment, contributing with a comprehensive and valuable tool for clinician practice and research. Method: The initial structure and content of the protocol was based on an extensive literature review of existing voice assessment tools. The content validity was then assessed by a panel of voice specialist, using a modified Bland and Altman graphical method and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A group of participants with vocal pathology was finally assessed by two voice specialists on the same day (inter-rater reliability), and, on a second day, by a single evaluator (intra-rater reliability). Inter and intra-reliability were evaluated through Cohen's kappa (k) for nominal variables, and Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (ρ) for quantitative and ordinal variables. Results: The Bland and Altman analysis, revealed a reasonable agreement between the experts and the ICC values were lower than expected, but the confidence intervals were very wide. The intra-rater reliability of the protocol's nominal variables was almost perfect, with a mean k of 0.977; inter-rater reliability of nominal variables was also almost perfect, with a mean k of 0.893. The ordinal and quantitative variables revealed a very good to excellent relationship, with a mean ρ of 0.912. Conclusions: Evidence of content validity, high intra and inter-rater reliability of a standardised protocol for voice assessment, have been shown. This protocol can be used to assess and collect data from patients, to train voice specialists and to develop reference voice databases. It has been designed to serve voice experts with diverse backgrounds and assessment needs.",

Escola Superior de Saúde (ESSUA), Universidade de Aveiro Campus Universitário de Santiago, Agras do Crasto Aveiro 3810-193 Portugal Purpose A comprehensive protocol to evaluate voice quality can support a full characterisation of voice disorders and be used to plan voice interventions. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a standardised protocol for voice assessment, contributing with a comprehensive and valuable tool for clinician practice and research. Method The initial structure and content of the protocol was based on an extensive literature review of existing voice assessment tools. The content validity was then assessed by a panel of voice specialist, using a modified Bland and Altman graphical method and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A group of participants with vocal pathology was finally assessed by two voice specialists on the same day (inter-rater reliability), and, on a second day, by a single evaluator (intra-rater reliability). Inter and intra-reliability were evaluated through Cohen's kappa (k) for nominal variables, and Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (ρ) for quantitative and ordinal variables. Results The Bland and Altman analysis, revealed a reasonable agreement between the experts and the ICC values were lower than expected, but the confidence intervals were very wide. The intra-rater reliability of the protocol's nominal variables was almost perfect, with a mean k of 0.977; inter-rater reliability of nominal variables was also almost perfect, with a mean k of 0.893. The ordinal and quantitative variables revealed a very good to excellent relationship, with a mean ρ of 0.912. Conclusions Evidence of content validity, high intra and inter-rater reliability of a standardised protocol for voice assessment, have been shown. This protocol can be used to assess and collect data from patients, to train voice specialists and to develop reference voice databases. It has been designed to serve voice experts with diverse backgrounds and assessment needs. Key Words Voice Assessment Protocol INTRODUCTION The multidimensionality of voice requires perceptual evaluation, aerodynamic and acoustic analysis. 1–4 Therefore, a comprehensive protocol to evaluate voice quality is pertinent for a reliable diagnosis, to support a full comprehension and characterisation of voice disorders and to adapt interventions to the patients’ background. 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 In Portugal, there is no reliable and valid protocol to evaluate voice comprehensively. The assessment of vocal pathologies is not uniform, because each voice specialist uses individual and diverse forms to evaluate in their own clinical practice. The patient is assessed with tools that try to include the most important and appropriate dimensions for each patient based in existing protocols, which have unfortunately been originally developed for languages and countries other than their own. 7 Due to the lack of standardised protocols, comparisons between research studies, voice disorders management strategies and treatment efficacy is difficult. 3 In this paper, a standardised protocol for voice assessment, University of Aveiro's Voice Evaluation Protocol (Protocolo de Avaliação da Qualidade Vocal da Universidade de Aveiro – PAQVUA), is presented. The first version of PAQVUA was developed over a decade ago, 9 and subsequently revised, supplemented with a comprehensive manual and validated as described in this paper. This protocol has been used regularly in the largest central Hospital in the North of Portugal, to assess and collect data from over 1500 patients, to train voice specialists, in research, and to the develop the Advanced Voice Function Assessment Databases, 2 as part of University of Aveiro's Advanced Communication and Swallowing Assessment (ACSA) open access resources available from This voice evaluation protocol contributes toward improving assessment methods used by voice specialists and makes them accessible to all clinicians. A study conducted to test the reliability of the protocol, including the analysis of inter and intra-rater correlation, and to test the content validity, is described in this paper. METHOD The present paper focuses on the study of the content validity, and inter- and intra-rater reliability of the protocol. Validity and reliability are 2 essential psychometric properties in a measuring method. 8 Validity attests if the measuring method explains what it proposes to explain, while reliability refers to the consistency and stability of that method. Content validity: literature review (defining structure and content) The initial structure and content of PAQVUA was based on an extensive literature review of existing protocols. 9 It was developed as an easy to apply and inexpensive tool for voice specialists with the aim to standardise and comprehensively evaluate voice quality. To revise it, a search of English written articles was performed in Pubmed, Scopus and Scholar Google, from March 2009 to March 2019. Search-terms included: Voice; assessment; evaluation; protocol. A total of 345 papers were found, whose titles and abstracts were then analysed. Papers about paediatric populations, oncology, intervention or management of voice and swallowing disorders were excluded. Eleven articles were used as the basis of the protocol revision. From this review, a new score sheet was defined, as well as a manual where all the relevant information regarding the protocol is presented. Content validity: expert panel After the most recent (2009–2019) literature review and update of the original protocol, 9 the second stage of content validity was the evaluation of the instrument by an expert panel. 10 Content validity of PAQVUA was assessed by an expert panel of 6 voice specialist, with over 5 years of clinical experience, from the North and Centre of Portugal. 11 The expert panel evaluated all components of PAQVUA by completing a questionnaire to ascertain the relevance, clarity and precision of each of the assessment items and the content of the manual. The questionnaire had three different sections: Section 1 was about the PAQVUA Score Sheet; Section 2 about the PAQVUA Manual; Section 3 about general aspects of the protocol. eg, in Section 1, the first question was “Do you agree with the organisation of the PAQVUA manual?”; in Section 2, the question 4.a. was “About the section A of PAQVUA – Perceptual evaluation of voice quality – do you agree that the chosen tasks are relevant?”; in Section 3, the second question was “Do you agree with the usefulness of PAQVUA in voice specialists’ practice?” Each participant had to place a mark on a 100 millimetre Visual-Analog Scale (VAS), that had 5 anchors equally distributed, with the following labels: Total disagreement (0 %); disagreement; neutral; agreement; total agreement (100 %). The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the relevance of the different items of PAQVUA and the need to revise some of them. The agreement between the 6 expert panel members was evaluated with a modified Bland and Altman 12 analysis based on the quantitative data acquired from questionnaires. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was also calculated, 13 using IBM SPSS Statistics 21, for each of the three different sections of the questionnaire to assess the agreement between the experts. Reliability The reliability of PAQVUA in a clinical context was assessed in a sample of 12 participants with vocal pathology (11 female and 1 male; age range 25–85 years; mean = 50.6 years). They were recruited through a convenience non-probabilistic sampling method. 14 The inclusion criteria were: To be over 18 years old and clinically diagnosed with vocal pathology. The sample included one participant with vocal nodules, three with vocal polyps, two with presbyphonia, three with chronic laryngitis, two with unilateral vocal fold paralysis and one with minimal structural changes. The protocol was applied to all participants by 2 evaluators on the same day (inter-rater reliability), and, on a second day, by a single evaluator (intra-rater reliability). The second moment was 1 week later to ensure no alterations in participants’ voice quality. Participants were recorded in a seated position, with an omni-directional electret Behringer EMC8000 microphone at a distance of 30 cm from the mouth of the speaker, connected to a PreSonus AudioBox USB interface running at a sampling frequency of 48000 Hz, with 16 bits per sample. Procedures followed the PAQVUA Manual instructions, and assessment sessions lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. All participants signed an informed consent after all procedures were explained. The same Sennheirser HD 201 headphones were used by the two evaluators in the perceptual and acoustic evaluation. Statistical analysis of reliability contemplated 171 variables that included all parameters assessed by PAQVUA. Each variable was collected three times: In the first moment by two evaluators (inter-rater reliability) and in the second moment by one evaluator (intra-rater reliability). The 171 variables were grouped into two sets: 135 nominal variables and 36 ordinal or quantitative variables. eg, in global evaluation, the posture of the lips at rest is a nominal variable because is evaluated as “sealed” or “open” and in acoustic analysis of the voice, the fundamental frequency is a quantitative variable. Inter and intra-reliability were assessed through Cohen's kappa (k) for nominal variables, and Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (ρ) for quantitative and ordinal variables. This analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21. Microsoft Excel 2019 was also used to process and to run the modified Bland and Altman 12 analysis. In all analysis the significant level considered was α = 0.05. Ethical approval was obtained from all authorities required by Portuguese bylaws for clinical research: national data protection committee; independent ethics committees. Results This section focuses on the results of a content validity and reliability (inter and intra-rater correlation) analysis of PAQVUA. Content validity: literature review (defining structure and content) Patients usually seek therapy when they perceive a voice quality deviation, 1 so a comprehensive voice evaluation usually involves a variety of procedures that include a medical examination, patient interview, self-assessment, perceptual evaluation of voice, acoustic and aerodynamic analysis, and evaluation of vocal fold movement. 15 , 16 The PAQVUA is intended as a working tool for voice specialists, which brings together a range of essential information to plan a therapeutic intervention. 9 In some cases, in clinical practice, it is not necessary or possible to assess all parts of the protocol. However, the success of the evaluation and intervention process requires a thorough collection of information. 16 Therefore, PAQVUA includes the following representative dimensions of voice assessment that can be evaluated by any voice specialists: Perceptual evaluation of voice quality; aerodynamic measures; global evaluation; acoustic analysis. This modular organisation allows the users to easily adapt the assessment procedures according to their clinical resources and needs. Perceptual evaluation of voice quality Perceptual analysis of voice quality in PAQVUA includes a Portuguese version of the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Rough, Breathy, Astenic and Strain (GRBAS) scales. 7 , 17 The GRBAS 18 , 19 and CAPE-V 4 , 20 , 21 scales are the most widely used clinical subjective scales to measure voice quality. They are both recommended as part of standardised voice evaluation protocols, 17 so the PAQVUA includes the 2 scales. The CAPE-V 4 , 20 , 21 scale includes 6 sentences designed to elicit the production of every Portuguese oral vowel, easy onset with /s/, only voiced phonemes, hard glottal attack, nasal phonemes and voiceless stops. 7 , 17 , 22 The GRBAS 18 , 19 scale defines 5 parameters for vocal quality classification: Grade (G); Rough (R); Breathy (B); Astenic (A); Strain (S). These parameters assess the grade of alteration of vocal quality (G), the psychoacoustic impression of irregularity in vocal fold vibration (R), the psychoacoustic impression of air passage through the glottis (B), the lack of energy in the voice (A) and impression of the state of hyperfunction of phonation. 17 The 2 scales were selected based on a thorough literature review considering both the most widely used scales in clinical practice, not just in Europe, where a scale like GRBAS has been used for more than 20 years as part of a “basic protocol for functional assessment of voice pathology”, 23 but also in the USA and other countries, where it has also been recommended by American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) as a “tool for clinical auditory-perceptual assessment of voice”. 21 We also wanted to be using the scales that have been the basis of the largest number of reference values 2 both in terms of auditory-perceptual assessment and acoustic measures of voice function. Other subjective aspects of speech articulation 24 and the presence of cough and frequent deglutition 6 , 25 were also considered in this section. Aerodynamic measures Aerodynamic measures of voice are collected by most voice evaluation protocols. 26 The PAQVUA allows the user to register non-instrumental aerodynamic measurements of voice because they are quick and non-invasive, including 6 : Breathing pattern, in terms of the breathing mode (oral, nasal or mixed), locus of respiration (upper breathing, thoracic breathing or abdominal breathing) and breathing pattern (regular, irregular, rapid or low) at rest and during phonation; breath control during sustained phonation, reading and conversation; coordination of respiration and phonation (maximum phonation time and S/Z ratio). The maximum phonation time, measured at a modal pitch level, is the longest duration that an individual can sustain a sound. This measure is commonly used for voice assessment to examine phonatory and respiratory coordination, indicating inefficient vocal fold vibration. 6 , 27 Despite the reported 28 issues regarding the reliability of this measure, it is still part of most assessments used “in clinical practice and research”. 26 In PAQVUA, 3 trials of sustained phonation in comfortable pitch and loudness are required and only the longest one is considered. 27 The S/Z ratio is also a non-instrumental measure that relates respiratory support deficit and laryngeal inefficiency through a relative durational measure. 2 trials of sustained /s/ and /z/ are required as part of PAQVUA. 6 , 29 Aerodynamic measures provide valuable information about laryngeal and respiratory function, impacting the precision of initial diagnosis and providing feedback to patients with voice disorders. 27 , 30 Global evaluation The assessment of the oral cavity and peripheral structures are included in PAQVUA to explore how they might impair the patient's speech production. This evaluation should integrate a laryngeal examination through digital manipulation and observation of posture and neck muscle tension. 6 In PAQVUA, the psychological characterisation of patients is considered as a dimension that explores the emotional, social and family difficulties that can be associated with etiologic factors and with the development of the voice disorder. It is important to understand the functional impact of the voice disorder on the individual's daily life. 6 This can be better explored with the Voice Handicap Index. 31 Acoustic analysis Instrumental measures of vocal function contribute to the voice evaluation because acoustic parameters can be related with perceptual parameters such as vocal loudness, pitch and voice quality. 3 The acoustic parameters analysed as part of PAQVUA are: Fundamental frequency; jitter; shimmer; mean harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Portuguese reference values 2 can be used to compare the results, generate voice profiles / radial graph and visualise variables that are out of the expected range. Acoustic voice analysis is an effective and non-invasive tool that can be used to quantify the qualitative measurements documented in an audio-perceptual evaluation, providing an objective identification of impairment. 32 The PAQVUA manual The PAQVUA manual is essential because it provides all the necessary information to ensure the reliability of the collected data. It includes a score sheet to guide the user through all assessment procedure and how they should be analysed. 33 The manual includes an introduction about voice assessment, the protocol structure description, where all evaluated dimensions are supported by clinical evidence available in the literature and the assessment conditions / prerequisites are clearly defined. All the selected voice evaluation dimensions resulted from an extensive literature review described previously in Section 2.1. Recommendations about the microphone and the software used for voice recording, and all the steps for voice recording with Praat, followed by a detailed description of each evaluation are presented in this manual. Finally, the manual includes the first non-Japanese version of the original manual of the GRBAS scale and the first Portuguese version of the detailed design considerations, description and instructions of CAPE-V. 17 The latest of version of the manual is available in open-access at Content validity: expert panel Content validity was assessed by an expert panel through a questionnaire divided into three sections, as described previously. The collected data was analysed using the modified Bland and Altman 12 method and by calculating the ICC for each part of the questionnaire. The first method used to analyse the experts’ questionnaires, involves plotting according to the modified Bland and Altman 12 method for more than 2 measurements. These graphs are a visual representation of the mean of the measurements and the standard deviation between the experts. This method quantifies a range of agreement, within which 95% of the values are included in previously defined limits of maximum acceptable differences. 34 Values outside the range show greater disagreement and should be subject to careful analysis and eventual revision of the corresponding items. About the PAQVUA Score Sheet, both the mean values and the standard deviations represented in Figure 1 show some variability (between 49 and 88, and 1 and 30, respectively; scores vary between 0, meaning total disagreement, and 100, meaning total agreement) and most of the mean values are above 60 (28 out of 32 datapoints). Nearly half of the items (17 out of 32) have a mean value that is higher than 75. All standard deviation values are below the estimated 95 percentile (P95), with the exception of one item (7c), which corresponds to the question: “Regarding the Acoustic Evaluation, do you agree that the information is accurate?” This item presented a mean value of 58 out of 100. Items 6b and 6c are lower than P95, but with mean values smaller then 60, which means that these are the items with more disagreement between the experts. Those items were: 6b – Was the Global Evaluation information clearly presented? 6c – Was the Global Evaluation information accurate? Figure 2 also shows a considerable dispersion of values, with mean values between 57 and 93, and with SD values between 2 and 39. In this figure, a group of 4 items stand above the upper limit (highlighted with an ellipse). These items generated the largest disagreement between the experts and the corresponding questions were: 5b – Regarding section A3 Verbal Articulation, do you agree that the items are clear? 6a – Regarding section A3 Associated perturbations, do you agree that the items are relevant? 6c – Regarding section A3 Associated perturbations, do you agree that the items are accurate? 15b – Regarding section C1 Orofacial motricity, do you agree that the items are clear? Nevertheless, 32 out of the 50 items showed mean values above 75. Despite all the variability, this section presents more agreement between the experts, than the previous one, with all mean values above 55 and smaller SD values (note that the P95 and the mean SD are smaller). Lower values of SD show more agreement between the experts. Section 3 includes only 3 items, namely: Do you agree that PAQVUA allows a multidimensional assessment of the human voice? Do you agree with the usefulness of PAQVUA for clinical practice? Do you agree with the usefulness of PAQVUA for research? In this section, all of the items lie below the P95 upper limit of the corresponding Bland and Altman 12 plot shown in Figure 3 . Like in the previous graphs, there is a considerable variability in the values (mean values between 67 and 84 and with SD values between 12 and 27). Figure 3 also shows more disagreement in item 1, with a lower mean value and a higher SD value. On the other hand, item 2 shows the largest agreement, with lower SD value and higher mean value. In this section the experts revealed the best agreement with the items since all the mean values are above 65. In general, all 3 sections show a global agreement of the experts towards PAQVUA (the overall mean value of each section lies above 70 out of 100) and a global agreement between the experts (few points lie below the limits in the graphs). Nevertheless, the variability observed was large and reveals that the agreement was not strong. In all sections the ICC(A,6) following 13 for absolute agreement between experts, was calculated. For Section 1, ICC = 0.479 (CI95% = (0.192; 0.701); ρ = 0.0001); for Section 2, ICC = 0.379 (CI95% = (0; 0.508); ρ = 0.027); for Section 3, ICC = 0.451 (CI95% = (0; 0.978); ρ = 0.059). According to Fleiss et al., 35 ICC values below 0.40 reflect poor agreement, between 0.40 and 0.75 fair to good agreement and greater than 0.75 excellent agreement. Therefore, the ICC values of this study reveal a fair to good agreement (Section 1 and 3) and poor agreement (Section 2). Clearly there is a high variability associated, as can be seen in the 95% confidence intervals. After this analysis, a meeting was held with two independent voice specialists. In this meeting, the items with more disagreement were discussed, to define a final version of PAQVUA according the opinion of these professionals. The revised items were those that were above P95 and those with low mean values and high SD values in the three sections: In Section 1 items 6b, 6c and 7c; in Section 2 items 5b, 6a, 6c and 15b; and in Section 3 item 1. Reliability Reliability was statistically analysed using the 171 variables in PAQVUA. Those variables were grouped according to the four sections of the protocol: A – Perceptual Evaluation of Voice Quality; B – Aerodynamic Measures; C – Global Evaluation; D – Acoustic Analysis. The intra-rater reliability of PAQVUA was tested by a single evaluator, who assessed the group of 12 participants (with vocal pathology) twice, only a week apart to ensure no alterations in the participants’ voice quality. Cohen's Kappa coefficient lies always between zero and 1. According to Watson and Petrie, 36 k values from 0.21 to 0.40 reflect a fair agreement, from 0.41 to 0.60 a moderate agreement, from 0.61 to 0.80 substantial agreement and from 0.81 to 1.00 almost perfect. Concerning the Spearman Correlation Coefficient, ρ values between 0.25 and 0.50 indicate a fair degree of relationship, between 0.50 and 0.75 a moderate to good relationship and larger than 0.75 a very good to excellent relationship. 37 Following these guidelines, Table 1 shows the average intra-rater reliability coefficients (Cohen's Kappa for the 135 nominal variables and Spearman Correlation Coefficient for the 36 ordinal or quantitative variables) and the percentage of values with more agreement in the different domains and in all the protocol. Most of the variables evaluated within this protocol are nominal. eg, larynx position in phonation is evaluated with 3 categories: Normal, high and low. The intra-rater reliability of PAQVUA is almost perfect for the nominal variables, with a mean k value of 0.977; Section D (Acoustic Analysis) only uses quantitative variables. In sections A, B and C all variables show at least a substantial agreement (k > 0.600), with 85% presenting perfect agreement (k = 1.000). In sections A and C, 92% and 99% of variables (respectively) show perfect agreement (k = 1.000), while in section B the same result (k = 1.000) occurs only in 63% of the variables. In the ordinal and quantitative variables, the overall agreement can be considered good since the mean value of ρ is 0.724. Overall, 85% of the variables show a moderate to excellent relationship (ρ > 0.500), and 59% of the variables show a very good to excellent relationship (ρ > 0.750). Section D is the only section with only a fair degree of relationship in contrast with section A where 91% of the variables show very good to excellent relationship. The inter-rater reliability of PAQVUA was tested by two evaluators, who assessed the group of 12 participants at a single moment in time. Table 2 shows the average inter-rater reliability coefficients (Cohen's Kappa for 135 nominal variables and Spearman Correlation Coefficient for 36 ordinal or quantitative variables) and the percentage of values with more agreement in the different domains of the protocol. The inter-rater reliability of PAQVUA ‘s nominal variables is almost perfect, 36 with a mean k value of 0.893. A very high percentage of the variables (90%) show substantial or almost perfect agreement. In section A and C, 72% and 97% of the variables show perfect agreement (k = 1) while in section B this only occurs with 47% of the variables. The ordinal and quantitative variables reveal a very good to excellent relationship, with mean ρ of 0.912. All the variables (100%) shows at least a moderate relationship and 98% of the variables show a very good to excellent relationship. 37 DISCUSSION This paper presents the first comprehensive open access protocol for voice assessment that has been analysed in terms of its content validity, intra and inter-rater reliability. The lack of standardised protocols and procedures for voice assessment limits the discussion and comparison of the results obtained in this study with other research. The studies referred to below are mainly about reliability and validity of protocols which evaluate specific voice dimensions. Content validity The development of PAQVUA was accomplished with an extensive literature review to ensure the relevance and pertinence of the content to adequately measure what the protocol is intended to measure, a procedure that is regarded as the first stage of content validity by Grant and Davis. 10 The content validity of PAQVUA’s Score Sheet and Manual were assessed using the modified Bland and Altman 12 method and the ICC coefficient. When analysing content validity, it is important to ensure that the expert panel is clear about the fundamental definitions and conceptual framework of the assessment instrument. 10 The PAQVUA Manual clarifies concepts and explains assessment procedures for all users. In Section 1, experts were questioned (relevance, clarity and precision) about the organisation of this Manual, specifically about the description of the protocol and general assessment conditions. Section 1 results were satisfactory, with values that show a general agreement between the experts with the proposed protocol, when analysed with the modified Bland and Altman 12 method, but results also revealed a large amount of variability. In this section, the ICC was 0.479 which shows a fair to good agreement and is consistent with the high variability observed. 3 items of the manual were revised. 1 was identified as having a SD above the agreement limits and the other 2 with mean values under 60, as specified previously. When experts were asked to evaluate the PAQVUA’s Score Sheet, results revealed a large dispersion of values, but more agreement between the experts than the previous section, with higher mean values and lower SD values. In general, experts agreed with the proposed PAQVUA Score Sheet sections (the items had mean values between 57 and 93). The results showed a general agreement of the experts about the PAQVUA Score Sheet, through the modified Bland and Altman 12 method, but again with high variability; 4 of the 50 items were above the upper limit. The ICC was 0.379 which shows a poor agreement and again confirms the high variability observed. The experts were also questioned about PAQVUA’s relevance as a multidimensional voice assessment tool and its usefulness in clinical practice and research. All items were within the agreement limits, but there was a large variability between the experts. Similar to the previous sections, an item with low mean value and higher SD value was revised. In this section, the ICC was 0.451 which shows a fair to good agreement. The Bland and Altman 12 analysis revealed that the majority of the items lied within the limits of agreement. The few items above the upper limit together with the items with lower mean values were revised. All graphs revealed a considerable amount of variability (wide range of mean vales and considerably high values of SD) but the mean values were generally high (global mean values per section above 70). Overall, the Bland and Altman 12 analysis reveals a reasonable agreement between the experts. The ICC values are lower than expected, but the confidence intervals are very wide, reflecting a high uncertainty of the results. The multiple dimensions of voice require comprehensive evaluation procedures, with a multi-modal assessment applied on a regular basis in research and in clinical practice. However, there is still a large variability in the contents and procedure used for voice evaluation, 3 which has been reflected in lower values of ICC. Reliability To assess reliability, 171 variables of PAQVUA were statistical analysed. The majority of the variables evaluated within this protocol are nominal. Intra-rater reliability assesses the variation of data measured by the same expert across two trials. 38 To assess the intra-rater reliability of PAQVUA the whole protocol was used to assess a group of patients twice, one week apart, by the same voice expert. The intra-rater reliability of PAQVUA’s nominal variables is almost perfect, with a mean Cohen's k of 0.977 and with 85% of the variables with perfect agreement (k = 1.000), in accordance with other studies. 39 , 40 Concerning the ordinal and quantitative variables, the overall agreement is considered good since the mean value of ρ is 0.724. Section D of the protocol is the only one with no nominal variables due to the nature of the acoustic analysis tasks. 15 The acoustic analysis was based on different recordings of the same participants, resulting in low mean values. Inter-rater reliability assesses the variation of measurements when collected by two or more experts who evaluate the same participants. 38 Inter-rater reliability of PAQVUA is almost perfect in the nominal variables, with a mean k of 0.893 and with 72% of the variables with perfect agreement (k = 1.000). The ordinal and quantitative variables reveal a very good to excellent relationship, with a mean ρ of 0.912. The inter-rater reliability results of section D (Acoustic Analysis) showed a mean ρ of 0.948, an almost perfect agreement. These values were as expected since the experts evaluated the same voice recording, using the same procedures. Different acoustic analysis procedures, 39 based on a low degree of accuracy of the visual verification with acoustic analysis software, have shown similar results in intra-measurer reliability for acoustic events. Overall, these results are in agreement with other studies about voice assessment, with high intra and inter-reliability. 39 Conclusions There is a wide variety of specific protocols used for voice assessment and a lack of standardised protocols and procedures that hinder possible comparisons across different studies. The purpose of this study was to develop a standardised protocol for voice assessment, contributing with a comprehensive and valuable tool for clinician practice and research. Therefore, the protocol presented in this paper, has a modular organisation that includes the perceptual evaluation of voice quality, aerodynamic measures, global evaluation and acoustic analysis. It is adaptable and useful for voice experts with diverse backgrounds and assessment needs. The PAQVUA manual includes the first non-Japanese version of the original manual of the GRBAS scale and the first Portuguese version of the detailed design considerations, description and instructions of CAPE-V. This manual is an important complement to the protocol, to clarify all assessment procedures and requirements. Evidence of content validity has been shown, based on Bland and Altman analysis, that revealed a reasonable agreement between the experts, and ICC values lower than expected, but with very wide confidence intervals. It is expected that the revised items would have improved the agreement between the evaluators, but the final version of PAQVUA was not re-evaluated, so it was not possible to quantify this improvement. Overall, PAQVUA presents high intra and inter-rater reliability. However, for future research, a larger sample for reliability tests should be considered for more representative results. Despite this limitation, this protocol provides added value to the study of vocal disorders in a clinical setting, as well as for scientific research in this area.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Collation of aphasia research data across settings, countries and study designs using big data principles will support analyses across different language modalities, levels of impairment, and therapy interventions in this heterogeneous population. Big data approaches in aphasia research may support vital analyses, which are unachievable within individual trial datasets. However, we lack insight into the requirements for a systematically created database, the feasibility and challenges and potential utility of the type of data collated. Aim: To report the development, preparation and establishment of an internationally agreed aphasia after stroke research database of individual participant data (IPD) to facilitate planned aphasia research analyses. Methods: Data were collated by systematically identifying existing, eligible studies in any language (≥10 IPD, data on time since stroke, and language performance) and included sourcing from relevant aphasia research networks. We invited electronic contributions and also extracted IPD from the public domain. Data were assessed for completeness, validity of value-ranges within variables, and described according to pre-defined categories of demographic data, therapy descriptions, and language domain measurements. We cleaned, clarified, imputed and standardised relevant data in collaboration with the original study investigators. We presented participant, language, stroke, and therapy data characteristics of the final database using summary statistics. Results: From 5256 screened records, 698 datasets were potentially eligible for inclusion; 174 datasets (5928 IPD) from 28 countries were included, 47/174 RCT datasets (1778 IPD) and 91/174 (2834 IPD) included a speech and language therapy (SLT) intervention. Participants’ median age was 63 years (interquartile range [53, 72]), 3407 (61.4%) were male and median recruitment time was 321 days (IQR 30, 1156) after stroke. IPD were available for aphasia severity or ability overall (n = 2699; 80 datasets), naming (n = 2886; 75 datasets), auditory comprehension (n = 2750; 71 datasets), functional communication (n = 1591; 29 datasets), reading (n = 770; 12 datasets) and writing (n = 724; 13 datasets). Information on SLT interventions were described by theoretical approach, therapy target, mode of delivery, setting and provider. Therapy regimen was described according to intensity (1882 IPD; 60 datasets), frequency (2057 IPD; 66 datasets), duration (1960 IPD; 64 datasets) and dosage (1978 IPD; 62 datasets). Discussion: Our international IPD archive demonstrates the application of big data principles in the context of aphasia research; our rigorous methodology for data acquisition and cleaning can serve as a template for the establishment of similar databases in other research areas.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Awake brain surgery, combined with neurophysiological evaluation and intraoperative mapping, is one of the preferential lines of treatment when approaching low-grade gliomas. Speech and language assessment is used while applying Direct Electrical Stimulation (DES) and during the resection of a lesion/tumour, as it allows to establish related eloquent areas and optimise the extent of the resection and avoid impairments. Patients need to be assessed pre, intra and post-surgery, but in under resourced countries such as Portugal, there are still no standardised and validated tools to conduct this type of evaluation. To address this need, the tasks of the Dutch Linguistic Intraoperative Protocol (DuLIP) were adapted to European Portuguese, and the resulting materials were standardised for a group of 144 Portuguese participants. For each task, the impact of age, gender and schooling were measured. The resulting Portuguese version of the DuLIP (DuLIP-EP) consists of 17 tasks, including phonological, syntactic, semantic, naming and articulatory tests. No significant differences were found between male and female participants. However, schooling influenced phonological and syntactic fluency, object naming and verb generation. Schooling and age had a significant impact on semantic fluency and reading with semantic odd word out tasks. This is the first contribution to the standardisation of a tool that can be used during an awake brain surgery in Portugal, which includes a new phonological odd word out task that is not currently available in the Dutch version.",

Four Portuguese speakers were recorded producing a corpus of nine isolated words with /b, d, ɡ/ in initial, medial and final word position, and the same nine words embedded in 39 different sentences. Slope of the stop release (SLP), voice onset time (VOT), release and stop durations and steady-state oral airflow amplitude characteristics preceding and following the stop were analysed. Differences between independent groups (three different places of articulation and two vowel contexts) and correlations between variables were studied; generalised linear mixed effects models were developed to study the effects of VOT, SLP and the factors place of articulation and vowel context on the mean oral airflow. A classification of stop’s voicing was automatically extracted. Both SLP (p =.013) and VOT (p =.014) were significantly different for the three places of articulation. Weak voicing was observed for 57% of the stops. It is hypothesised that the high percentages of weakly voiced stops are a consequence of passive voicing and that the feature of contrast in Portuguese is privative [spread glottis].",

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Purpose: Speech and language pathology (SLP) for aphasia is a complex intervention delivered to a heterogeneous population within diverse settings. Simplistic descriptions of participants and interventions in research hinder replication, interpretation of results, guideline and research developments through secondary data analyses. This study aimed to describe the availability of participant and intervention descriptors in existing aphasia research datasets. Method: We systematically identified aphasia research datasets containing ≥10 participants with information on time since stroke and language ability. We extracted participant and SLP intervention descriptions and considered the availability of data compared to historical and current reporting standards. We developed an extension to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist to support meaningful classification and synthesis of the SLP interventions to support secondary data analysis. Result: Of 11, 314 identified records we screened 1131 full texts and received 75 dataset contributions. We extracted data from 99 additional public domain datasets. Participant age (97.1%) and sex (90.8%) were commonly available. Prior stroke (25.8%), living context (12.1%) and socio-economic status (2.3%) were rarely available. Therapy impairment target, frequency and duration were most commonly available but predominately described at group level. Home practice (46.3%) and tailoring (functional relevance 46.3%) were inconsistently available. Conclusion : Gaps in the availability of participant and intervention details were significant, hampering clinical implementation of evidence into practice and development of our field of research. Improvements in the quality and consistency of participant and intervention data reported in aphasia research are required to maximise clinical implementation, replication in research and the generation of insights from secondary data analysis.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Speech and language therapy (SLT) benefits people with aphasia following stroke. Group level summary statistics from randomised controlled trials hinder exploration of highly complex SLT interventions and a clinically relevant heterogeneous population. Creating a database of individual participant data (IPD) for people with aphasia aims to allow exploration of individual and therapy-related predictors of recovery and prognosis. Aim: To explore the contribution that individual participant characteristics (including stroke and aphasia profiles) and SLT intervention components make to language recovery following stroke. Methods and procedures: We will identify eligible IPD datasets (including randomised controlled trials, non-randomised comparison studies, observational studies and registries) and invite their contribution to the database. Where possible, we will use meta- and network meta-analysis to explore language performance after stroke and predictors of recovery as it relates to participants who had no SLT, historical SLT or SLT in the primary research study. We will also examine the components of effective SLT interventions. Outcomes and results: Outcomes include changes in measures of functional communication, overall severity of language impairment, auditory comprehension, spoken language (including naming), reading and writing from baseline. Data captured on assessment tools will be collated and transformed to a standardised measure for each of the outcome domains. Conclusion: Our planned systematic-review-based IPD meta- and network meta-analysis is a large scale, international, multidisciplinary and methodologically complex endeavour. It will enable hypotheses to be generated and tested to optimise and inform development of interventions for people with aphasia after stroke. Systematic review registration: The protocol has been registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42018110947).",

Method: Twenty-two Portuguese children with phonologically based SSD were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interventions, tabletop or tablet (11 children in each group), and received intervention based on the same activities, with the only difference being the delivery. All children were treated by the same speech-language pathologist over 2 blocks of 6 weekly sessions, for 12 sessions of intervention. Participants were assessed at 3 time points: baseline; pre-intervention, after a 3-month waiting period; and post-intervention. Outcome measures included percentage of consonants correct, percentage of vowels correct, and percentage of phonemes correct. A generalization of target sounds was also explored. Results: Both tabletop and tablet-based interventions were effective in improving percentage of consonants correct and percentage of phonemes correct scores, with an intervention effect only evident for percentage of vowels correct in the tablet group. Change scores across both interventions were significantly greater after the intervention, compared to baseline, indicating that the change was due to the intervention. High levels of generalization (60% and above for the majority of participants) were obtained across both tabletop and tablet groups. Conclusions: The software proved to be as effective as a traditional tabletop approach in treating children with phonologically based SSD. These findings provide new evidence regarding the use of digital materials in improving speech in children with SSD.",

This paper presents the content validity, item analysis, reliability coefficients and evidences of construct validity of the instrument. Methods: Content validity analysis was based on a two-stage process: first, 11 pragmatic questionnaires were assessed to identify items that probe each pragmatic competency and to create the first version of the instrument; second, items were assessed qualitatively by an expert panel composed by adults who stutter and controls, and quantitatively and qualitatively by an expert panel composed by clinicians. A pilot study was conducted with five adults who stutter and five controls to analyse items and calculate reliability. Construct validity evidences were obtained using the hypothesized relationships method and factor analysis with 28 adults who stutter and 28 controls. Results: Concerning content validity, the questionnaires assessed up to 13 pragmatic competencies. Qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed ambiguities in items construction. Disagreement between experts was solved through item modification. The pilot study showed that the instrument presented internal consistency and temporal stability. Significant differences between adults who stutter and controls and different response profiles revealed the instrument’s underlying construct. Conclusion: The instrument is reliable and presented evidences of construct validity.",

In this paper, we present a production study to explore the controversial question about /l/ velarisation. Measurements of first (F 1 ), second (F 2 ) and third (F 3 ) formant frequencies and the slope of F 2 were analysed to clarify the /l/ velarisation behaviour in European Portuguese (EP). The acoustic data were collected from ten EP speakers, producing trisyl-labic words with paroxytone stress pattern, with the liquid consonant at the middle of the word in onset, complex onset and coda positions. Results suggested that /l/ is produced on a continuum in EP. The consistently low F 2 indicates that /l/ is velarised in all syllable positions, but variation especially in F 1 and F 3 revealed that /l/ could be “more velarised” or “less velarised” dependent on syllable positions and vowel contexts. These findings suggest that it is important to consider different acoustic measures to better understand /l/ velarisation in EP.",

All Rights Reserved.Background: A prototype of a tangible user interface (TUI) for a fishing game, which is intended to be used by children with speech sound disorders (SSD), speech and language therapists (SLTs), and kindergarten teachers and assistants (KTAs) and parents alike, has been developed and tested. Objective: The aim of this study was to answer the following question: How can TUIs be used as a tool to help in interventions for children with SSD? Methods: To obtain feedback and to ensure that the prototype was being developed according to the needs of the identified target users, an exploratory test was prepared and carried out. During this test using an ethnographic approach, an observation grid, a semistructured questionnaire, and interviews were used to gather data. A total of 4 different types of stakeholders (sample size of 10) tested the prototype: 2 SLTs, 2 KTAs, and 6 children. Results: The analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that the prototype addresses the existing needs of SLTs and KTAs, and it revealed that 5 out of 6 (83%) children enjoyed the activity. Results also revealed a high replay value, with all children saying they would play more. Conclusions: Serious games and tangible interaction for learning and problem solving serve both teachers and children, as children enjoy playing, and, through a playful approach, learning is facilitated. A clear pattern was observed: Children enjoyed playing, and numerous valid indicators showed the transposition of the traditional game into the TUI artefact was successful. The game is varied and rich enough to be attractive and fun. There is a clear need and interest in similar objects from SLTs and educators. However, the process should be even more iterative, with a multidisciplinary team, and all end users should be able to participate as co-designers.",

Previous systematic reviews mainly focused on development technological details of computer-based speech training systems or the potential of integrating mobile technology into education and rehabilitation, but recent systematic reviews have also evaluated the efficacy of computer-based speech and language therapy for children and how digital technology can support different activities, at school or elsewhere. Objective: This study aimed to analyze a continuous communication and joint team approach to develop solutions focused on the real needs of end users, which digitally emulate reliable and validated physical intervention materials for children with speech sound disorders (SSD). Methods: The Table to Tablet (T2T) software was developed using a design-based research methodology, which included four phases: activities development; ethnographic pretesting with a sample from the target population; software development; and beta-testing. The technology used to develop the software, the method used to ensure satisfaction and replay ability of the intervention materials, and results from the ethnographic and beta-testing phases are presented. Results: Nineteen activities were developed during the first phase, which were then tested, with 7 service users, using a physical prototype. The beta-test approach included extensive testing and reformulation, supported by direct, nonparticipant observation and data collection using a questionnaire designed for children. Feedback was used to improve the software and interaction with users. Conclusions: The use of T2T-based intervention programmes by speech and language therapists (SLTs) will allow these professionals to make a better and more effective communication intervention, based on proven methodologies, that coexists in a structured physical and a digital version. These versions provide a full, 6-week intervention program, with minimal effort in preparing the session by the SLTs while delivering a very consistent intervention, with high replay value. A continuous communication and joint team approach was beneficial to the project and to the development of a solution focused on the real needs of SLTs and children with SSD. All problems were approached as a team with different skills and expertise, which minimized errors (eg, the developer making choices that would save him from spending time doing something that would not be used) and time spent. To add to this, the importance of integrating the end users as testers and collecting their opinions and actions per session allowed the production of better-targeted activities.",

The aim of this paper is to describe the development and validation procedures of the Prova de Avaliação de Competências de Pré-Literacia (PACPL), which assesses letter knowledge. Method: This study includes data that has been gathered in two phases: pilot and main study. In the pilot study, an expert panel of six speech and language pathologists analysed the instrument. Children (n = 216) aged 5;0–7;11 participated in the main study that reports data related to the psychometric characteristics of the PACPL. Content validity, internal consistency, reliability and contributing factors to performance were examined statistically. Results: A modified Bland–Altman method revealed good agreement amongst evaluators. The main study showed that the PACPL has a very good internal consistency and high inter-rater (96.2% of agreement and a Cohen’s k value of 0.92) and intra-rater (95.6% of agreement and a Cohen’s k value of 0.91) agreement. Construct validity of the PCAPL was also assured (Cronbach’s α of 0.982). Significant differences were found between age groups with children increasing their letter knowledge with age. In addition, they were better at identifying than at producing both letter names and letter sounds. Conclusions: The PACPL is a valid and reliable instrument to assess letter knowledge in Portuguese children.",

Computer-assisted learning tools (CALTs) have potential to enhance the learning of these skills; however, few have been developed for this purpose and do not integrate all the required features. Thus, this study aimed to assess the usability of a new CALT for learning pulmonary auscultation. Computerized Lung Auscultation–Sound Software (CLASS) usability was assessed by eight physiotherapy students using computer screen recordings, think-aloud reports, and facial expressions. Time spent in each task, frequency of messages and facial expressions, number of clicks and problems reported were counted. The timelines of the three methods used were matched/synchronized and analyzed. The tasks exercises and annotation of respiratory sounds were the ones requiring more clicks (median 132, interquartile range [23–157]; 93 [53–155]; 91 [65–104], respectively) and where most errors (19; 37; 15%, respectively) and problems (n = 7; 6; 3, respectively) were reported. Each participant reported a median of 6 problems, with a total of 14 different problems found, mainly related with CLASS functionalities (50%). Smile was the only facial expression presented in all tasks (n = 54). CLASS is the only CALT available that meets all the required features for learning pulmonary auscultation. The combination of the three usability methods identified advantages/disadvantages of CLASS and offered guidance for future developments, namely in annotations and exercises. This will allow the improvement of CLASS and enhance students’ activities for learning pulmonary auscultation skills.",

An expert panel of six speech and language therapists analysed and discussed the L&S cards based on several criteria previously established. A Speech and Language Therapist carried out a 6-week therapeutic intervention with a group of seven Portuguese phonologically delayed pre-schoolers aged 5;3 to 6;5. The modified Bland–Altman method revealed good agreement among evaluators, that is the majority of the values was between the agreement limits. Additional outcome measures were collected before and after the therapeutic intervention process. Results indicate that the L&S cards facilitate the acquisition of letter-sound correspondences. Regarding speech sound production, some improvements were also observed at word level. The L&S cards are therefore likely to give phonetic cues, which are crucial for the correct production of therapeutic targets. These visual cues seemed to have helped children with phonological delay develop the above-mentioned skills.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Speech and language therapy (SLT) interventions for people with aphasia are complex – for example, interventions vary by delivery model (face-to-face, tele-rehabilitation), dynamic (group, 1-to-1) and provider. Therapists tailor the functional relevance and intervention difficulty to the individual’s needs. Therapy regimes are planned at a specific intensity (hours per week), frequency (number of weekly sessions), duration (time from start to end of therapy intervention) and dose (total number of therapy hours). Detailed and transparent description of interventions for people with aphasia facilitates replication in clinic, between-study comparisons and data-syntheses. Incomplete intervention reporting and inconsisten-cies in the use of terminology have been observed (RELEASE: REhabilitation and recovery of peopLE with Aphasia after StrokE Collaborators, 2015-2018; Brady, Kelly, Godwin, Enderby, & Campbell, 2016; Pierce, O’Halloran, Togher, & Rose, in press). Even when similar terms are used there may be little agreement on their use (Pierce et al., in press). Our RELEASE Collaboration includes 72 multidisciplinary, multilingual aphasia researchers from 28 countries. In preparation for planned meta-analyses (HS&DR 14/04/22) we sought to extract and synthesise information on SLT interventions for aphasia. Description of interventions in research reports have benefited from the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR; (Hoffmann et al., 2014). The TIDieR checklist supports transparent reporting, data extraction and synthesis in aphasia research. It has facilitated an exploration of the contribution specific parameters (for example intensity) may make to the effectiveness of (or tolerance to) an intervention (Brady et al., 2016). However, while the variables described above are readily summarised, other aspects of therapeutic interventions such as the theoretical approach, the materials used and the procedures employed (the “Why” and “What” within TIDieR) are more challenging to summarise in manner supporting data synthesis and meta-analyses. The World Health Organisation’s (“International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI),”) also seeks a framework which supports the synthesis and statistical analysis of healthcare interventions based on (a) the treatment target, (b) the intended action to the target and (c) the processes and methods required to carry out the action (ICHI, 2018). However a framework which complements these initiatives and which supports greater consistency in the description of SLT interventions for aphasia is required. Aims: We sought to develop international consensus on a framework to support the description of SLT interventions for people with aphasia. Methods and procedures: Two researchers independently extracted information about the SLT interventions in our RELEASE database (Hoffmann et al., 2014). Information on therapy approaches, materials and procedures were extracted, where possible, as direct quotes from published reports. Using the narrative descriptions, similar approaches were grouped and assigned to one or more category labels by an experienced speech and language therapist. These preliminary groupings were shared with RELEASE Collaborators for review. Each reviewed interventions included within up to four category labels and responses via email were requested. There followed an opportunity for group discussion on the proposed categorisation via videoconference. Outcomes and results: Therapy interventions were categorised based on three per-spectives (a) the role of the intervention within the study design e.g., usual care as a comparison control (b) the intervention target e.g., rehabilitation of spoken language production and (c) the theoretical approach e.g., semantic therapy. We identified 15 SLT approaches. Categories were not mutually exclusive; rather they represented different ways of categorising a complex intervention. Inadequate reporting of therapy interven-tions, procedures and materials hampered some classifications. The Collaboration facilitated knowledge sharing relating to emerging treatment category definitions such as multimodal treatment (Pierce et al., in press) which reflected interventions aimed to utilise a range of learning mechanisms and neural networks to facilitate language recovery. Conclusions: Our collaboration agreed on a framework which supports transparent description, data synthesis and meta-analyses of SLT interventions for people with aphasia after stroke.",

Method: The APAT were constructed using Excel spreadsheets with formulas. The tools were presented to an expert panel for content validation. The corpus used in the Portuguese standardized test Teste Fonético-Fonológico–ALPE produced by 24 children with phonological delay or phonological disorder was recorded, transcribed, and then inserted into the APAT. Reliability and validity of APAT were analyzed. Results: The APAT present strong inter- and intrajudge reliability (>97%). The content validity was also analyzed (ICC = 0.71), and concurrent validity revealed strong correlations between computerized and manual (traditional) methods. Conclusions: The development of these tools contributes to fill existing gaps in clinical practice and research, since previously there were no valid and reliable tools/instruments for automatic phonological analysis, which allowed the analysis of different corpora.",

Keywords Service delivery Speech and language therapy School-based services Children Introduction Speech and language disorders have been reported to have a prevalence of 2–25% in children. 1–7 These disorders in children can adversely affect emotional, educational and occupational development. 8 If Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) can be provided at the earliest stage of development then these problems can be more easily remediated. 9,10 However, schools and public services have been facing, over the last years, a loss of funding to support the inclusion of speech and language therapists, which has had a negative impact in these services. 11 Difficult economic times place an exceptional burden on schools and public services to deliver the best education with fewer resources. 11–13 These particular circumstances have a significant impact in small and fragile economies of countries such as Portugal, severely limiting the access to SLT in schools and public services. Currently, speech and language therapists often work with clients/families facing multiple complex communication problems and requiring social assistance who, regardless of their urgent needs, can not have access to support in overcoming difficulties that most likely will create subsequent complications. If speech and language therapist intervention is not provided, then the risk is that communication difficulties become more severe and pervasive and may require more complex interventions. 9 The specific legislation in countries such as Portugal, excludes a considerable number of children who need special support, so it is not possible to give adequate educative responses to these children because of legal limitations. 14 This legislation states that children with permanent special needs should have access to adequate educational responses. However, in reality only deaf, blind and autistic children, as well as children with cerebral palsy and other neuro-development disorders, are actually considered. 15 All the other children who do not have a diagnosis of permanent special need have a reduced chance of support by public services. Children with language, speech and/or communication difficulties are often part of this group that cannot have access to specialised support. Some of these children are treated in private practices but there are a large number of parents with economic difficulties who cannot provide their children with much needed care. This lack of support may lead to the accumulation of difficulties (that could be overcome if intervention was given), turning them into chronic alterations, and this can also lead to developmental disadvantage, poor social skills, behavioural problems, emotional difficulties, literacy disadvantage, and mental illness. 9,14 This can also reduce the chance of successful treatment and result in many children not completing or not having treatment before they start school. When this happens, children may access a new learning environment with an undiagnosed and untreated disorder. This often hinders academic performance and educational progression. 8,16 This calls for new ways of providing support to children who otherwise would not have adequate responses to their problems. A common approach to meet the children's needs has been the provision of treatment by private units associated with mainstream schools. 17 To establish new ways of providing support, it is important to create a well-structured design scheme. Breaking down service delivery programs structure into their components is very helpful for examining the inputs and resources that are needed to implement them. 18 Alongside this, the opportunity to develop new roles across traditional professional and agency boundaries must be exploited. 19 Guidelines for service quality assurance Children's SLT services should follow specific international guidelines. 19–21 The assessments can be conducted in a clinical or educational setting and/or other natural environment conducive to eliciting representative samples of children's speech language and communication abilities. The assessment should be based in standardised and informal tests that allow the evaluation of speech, language, orofacial myofunction, and communication. After assessment it is important to produce a report and the resulting information should be conveyed to the teacher and the caregiver. The report should include screening results, and recommendations, indicating the need for rescreening, assessment, or for a referral. 19–21 After the assessment and report, the next step should be the intervention. The intervention and consultation services should be provided when there is a reasonable expectation of benefit to the child in body structure/function and/or activity/participation, and the services should be based on the best available scientific and clinical evidence in conjunction with individual considerations. 19–21 Treatment may be conducted in a variety of settings, including homes, day care centres, clinics, and schools that are selected on the basis of intervention goals and in consideration of natural contexts for the child. 21 The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association 22 has previously described various options for SLT service delivery methods - the pull-out method being the most prevalent option: children are provided with one-to-one or a small group therapy sessions in an independent room environment. 23–26 The caregivers should be encouraged to be present during intervention sessions because training of others, including parents, should be viewed as a central activity for speech and language therapists to maximise the impact to the child and his/her family. 19 In any setting, intervention should be family centred, developmentally supportive, culturally appropriate and should address the personal and environmental factors that are barriers to or facilitators of children's communication. 19,21,27 Follow-up procedures are used to complete or supplement an assessment, monitor progress during intervention and/or determine status after screening, assessment, intervention or discharge. 21 The best practices described above should be the basis of a service delivery model, so it is very important to ensure that the right resources and conditions are in place when implementing these practices. This can be found at the University of Aveiro (UA), in Portugal, where an alternative SLT service delivery model has been developed, to overcome a generalised limited provision for children. At the UA, parents and teachers find a specialised team of speech and language therapists who can cover a wide range of areas. This team is able to provide care based on current best clinical practice guidelines. Furthermore, the clinic at the Speech, Language and Hearing Laboratory (SLHlab), is very well adapted to speech and language therapists', audiologists', psychologists', parents' and children's needs, which facilitates assessment and treatment. This represents an added value and has allowed clinicians to support local children who would not have access to SLT treatment in other ways. Unfortunately, there are no program delivery guidelines for organising or implementing speech-language and hearing services. 12 The aim of this article was to explore and provide new insights into the possibility of constructing an alternative delivery system of SLT services to address the problem presented above and to discuss how to ensure the best practices. We present here an approach that was able to respond to the needs of children as an alternative service delivery model based in partnerships between the UA and local schools. This model intends to be an alternative to the lack of support experienced by the children with language, speech and/or communication disorders (children without permanent special needs) that were not covered by public legislation as priorities for service delivery. The article first describes the methodology used to establish a new way of providing SLT support to children in pre-school and school aged children. The percentage of children flagged and in need of support, long-term outcomes designed to reveal if the therapy delivered has lasting effects and three case studies are presented and discussed. These three case studies are representative of the main intervention areas that had a major incidence in this sample. Case studies allow a careful and detailed observation, they are suitable for preliminary research and during the development of new assessment and intervention programs. 28 Case studies present a great value because many communication disorders are heterogeneous in nature. 29 In general, case studies present several advantages as close observation of individual changes over time, are cost-effective and positive results are enough to guarantee the need for more experimental investigation with larger samples. 30 However analysis of case studies commonly relies on visualising some aspects of the data and formal statistical approaches (normally relying on the use of continuous data) may not be the best option in these cases. Case study designs can be criticised for being less rigorous and statistically robust. 31 The determination of statistically significant change in outcome measures is thus very important for research. One method of measuring the statistical significance of individual change is to analyse the 95% credible intervals (CI) 30 as used in this study. Aims This study aims to present and describe a methodology of SLT service delivery to diminish the gap between the number of children in need of support and the number of children who actually receive this support. This methodology was implemented in Portugal but the same gap between the number of children in need and children receiving support is experienced in many other countries. Method The study was carried out at the University of Aveiro in Portugal. It was developed as part of a project where digital materials for speech and language therapists to work with children with Speech Sound Disorders (SSD) were validated. 32–34 This project's team included a speech and language therapist who was able to implement the method described below. Furthermore, another speech and language therapist (a funded Ph.D. student) also participated in the provision of services. This fact allowed the implementation of a free support system for children and for kindergartens/schools. This service targeted mainly children in pre-school and primary school age (with some exceptions regarding children and adolescents referred by external speech and language therapists). To our best knowledge, there is no similar service delivery established between a university, with a SLT team with different specialisation areas, and schools in Portugal, where children with speech and language difficulties could benefit from free therapy; for that reason, outcomes need to be analysed to assess the feasibility of the proposed service delivery model. Those outcomes and conclusions could be widespread, to support a similar implementation, financed by regional administrations. This service delivery incorporated the six step procedure described in Fig. 1 , based on the best practices described above. Establishing partnerships The first step to establish partnerships was to identify the schools and institutions in the Aveiro region that could benefit from SLT support. A list of contacts of every school and institution that did not have internal speech and language therapists or that was not covered by national public services was made. A total of 30 schools were contacted and a meeting was held (where the project was explained) with the heads of institutions that replied (a total of 25). The project had good acceptability; all the schools and institutions that replied to the first contact established by the research team accepted to participate and showed enthusiasm regarding the project, mainly because this was the only way that some children (with economic difficulties) could have free support. After the first meeting, the research team started the project implementation that included a second meeting with the teachers to explain the project in more detail and directly to them, to answer questions and to ask them to flag the children who they thought presented difficulties in speech perception/production and language development. Flagging children During the initial meeting, the research team provided the teachers with information related to normal linguistic development and characteristics of communication impairments. The school teachers were asked to flag any child who they considered as being in need of SLT support, based on the information gathered on the initial meeting. After the identification of the children, an informed consent was sent to the parents of the flagged children. If the parents consented, it was handed back to the school teachers who forwarded them to the research team. Although the main way of flagging was by the process described above, some children reached the service by flagging of external speech and language therapists and parents. Assessment Every flagged child was then assessed by a certified Speech and Language Therapist, at three specific time-points: Pre-intervention, one week post-intervention (reported in case studies) and 18 months post-intervention (reported for all of those children who returned to the clinic for post-intervention long-term assessments). The assessments were based in standardised and informal tests that allowed the evaluation of speech, language, orofacial myofunction, fluency and communication according to the needs of the child flagged. Related to language, the TL-ALPE, 37,47 a norm-referenced instrument, was used to assess the comprehensive and oral expressive language (semantics and morphosyntax). The TL-ALPE presents content validity, construct validity, criterion validity and inter- and intra-judge reliability. The TFF-ALPE 35,36 was the norm-referenced test used to assess the verbal articulation and type and percentage of occurrence of phonological processes. Inter- and intra-judge validity, content and construct validity were assured. To assess the oro-motor function of face, lips, jaw, teeth, tongue and palate, the PAOF test 38 was used. Related to fluency, spontaneous speech samples were collected and assessed in terms of stuttering severity. In addition, the impact of stuttering in quality of life was assessed through the administration of the Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering questionnaire. 39 The assessment process was audio-recorded using a Behringer ECM8000 microphone located 1 m from the mouth of the children. The microphone was connected to an Olympus LS-100 recorder. The assessments took place in two distinct environments: The SLHlab clinic at the UA; the children's schools. Children were diagnosed based on several parameters. For SSD, inclusion criteria were: no alterations on oro-motor structure and function (assessed with the PAOF); 38 no symptoms of verbal dyspraxia; normal receptive language assessed with the TL-ALPE; 47 presenting at least two phonological processes. 61,62 Children were diagnosed with developmental language disorder (DLD) if language scores were below −1.5 SD the mean of TL-ALPE and in the absence of another condition such as hearing impairment, emotional or behavioural difficulties, autism, neurological impairment or general developmental difficulties. Children with Fluency Disorders (FD) were signalled when they presented a minimum frequency of stuttering-like disfluencies (i.e. sounds, syllables or one syllable words repetition; prolongations of sounds or blocks of airflow or voicing in speech) of three per 100 syllables; greater than average duration, effort, and tension of stuttering-like disfluencies and concerned about fluency disruption. 63 In addition to the assessment instruments described above, which are specific to the field of SLT, the two speech and language therapists also collected information concerning academic activities. Academic activities should be part of a comprehensive assessment and refer to general school experiences. Data collected at school settings provide data that are useful to analyse functional communication abilities. The collection of information concerning academic activities could be made through systematic observation (i.e. observation of school performance) or measurement (i.e. school performance or academic achievement in norm-tests). In the therapy delivery service implemented, the speech and language therapists collected data through systematic observation of children's speech and language during oral activities in school environment, kindergarten teachers' feedback and academic achievement in norm-tests for those children in primary school at 18 months post-therapy. In Portuguese primary schools, academic achievement is assessed in three core areas (mathematics, primary language and social studies), and results reported using the following assignment of test scores to qualitative descriptors: 0–49% not good enough (insuficiente); 50–69% good enough (suficiente); 70–89% good (bom); 90–100% very good (muito bom). All participants in this study were in kindergarten at pre-intervention assessment, where, in Portugal, academic achievement is not assessed with norm-tests. We therefore only presented academic results for children who were enrolled in primary school at the time of assessment. Reporting and discussion with caregivers and teachers After the SLT assessment, a report was made for each child and the results were communicated to the teachers and parents/caregivers. The report included screening results and recommendations, indicating the need for rescreening, assessment, or for a referral. Children were excluded from the study if they presented an adequate linguistic development for their age group or referred to SLT treatment if they presented alterations that were inclusion criteria for any of the communication disorders referred above. Treatment and post-treatment assessment After the report was given to caregivers and teachers, 75 children benefited from individualised intervention services that were provided at the clinic or their schools when they were not able to travel to the clinic. The children were provided with one-to-one therapy sessions in an independent room environment. When possible, the caregivers were encouraged to be present during the intervention. Due to the complexity of each disorder and the variability within each child, the intervention procedures must comprise different intervention methods to fully respond to the children's needs. Therefore, the intervention strategies were based on several evidence-based approaches. Concerning SSD intervention, a phonologically based intervention was used. It consisted of a combination of phonological awareness activities 40 adapted from Gillon and McNeill's 41 phonological awareness programme, as well as Hodson & Paden's 42 auditory bombardment and discrimination and listening tasks from Lancaster. 43 Related to DLD, several forms of a hybrid approach were used, that is, specific language goals were considered for intervention, based on the assessment process. The activities and materials were selected by the clinician to consciously elicit the spontaneous use of the language skills targeted by the intervention plan objectives 49 . General methods of modelling, imitation and reinforcement to develop learning and language skills were also used. 48,49 Related to intervention on stuttering, the eclectic methodology approach developed by Guitar 50 was used. Identification, desensitisation, learning of fluency skills and generalisation were the phases of the intervention approach used. 50 After a period of intervention, a short-term follow-up assessment (one week post-intervention) was performed to monitor progress and to determine the need of further treatment or discharge. All 75 children who benefited from individualised intervention were targeted for a long-term follow-up assessment 18 months post-intervention. Two certified speech and language therapists, blind to the purposes of the study, were involved. They first contacted the caregiver to schedule an assessment session. During the follow-up session, the assessment procedures and instruments applied were similar to those used in the pre-treatment session and included (when available) the collection of information related to academic progress and achievements. More specifically, the following long-term outcomes were investigated: phonetic-phonological standardised test percentiles and raw scores; receptive and expressive language percentiles and raw scores according to a standardised language test; percentage of syllables stuttered; duration of stuttering moments; academic achievement in norm-tests’ core areas (mathematics, Portuguese language and social studies). For comparison purposes, during post-intervention assessment, children who were above the maximum age band (only 26% of the total number of children) on both the TFF-ALPE and TL-ALPE, were compared with the maximum age band available. Therefore, raw score data for the TFF-ALPE phonetic/production subtest were also provided for reference. IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was used to perform a non-parametric paired-sample analysis through the Wilcoxon-signed ranks test to compare several long-term outcomes before and after the intervention considered in this article. A pre-test of this model was conducted in one kindergarten. The methodology used was similar to those presented on each phase. It was concluded that the methodology was feasible to be generalised to a larger sample of 25 schools and kindergartens in the Aveiro region. Case studies The case studies represent ‘an empirical enquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon in-depth and within its real-life context’. 31 In the three cases, a summary of the patient clinical history and referral process, the assessment procedures, the setting where the intervention took place, details about the intervention and the patients progress based on pre- and post-intervention outcome measures, are presented. The first case study refers to a child with SSD, where an intervention based on phonological awareness activities was employed. The second case study refers to a child with DLD and the third case study describes an intervention with an adolescent who stutters. Those individuals were chosen since they represent the three main intervention groups in the sample, i.e. SSD, DLD and FD. The presented cases were selected using a random procedure within each group. The outcome measures are specific to each case study. Ninety-five percent credible intervals To address whether the observed changes in the case studies presented can be considered statistically significant (i.e. whether the intervention provided using this service delivery program was effective), the 95% credible intervals (CI) for the difference in proportions were constructed according to the methodology described in Unicomb et al. 30 The binomial distribution was taken as the underlying statistical model as it is a discrete distribution that is applicable whenever a fixed number of trials, n, is considered, for which there are only two possible outcomes: The success with probability p and the failure with probability 1−p. The trials are independent of each other and one is focused in counting the number of successful events in the total number of trials. In case study 1 (SSD), for instance, n represents the total number of consonants, x is the number of correct consonants and p = x/n is the proportion of correct consonants. With the 95% CI for the difference in two proportions, it is possible to test if the difference between pre- and post-treatment scores can be considered statistically significant. The same pre- and post-treatment analysis can be established for case studies 2 (DLD) and 3 (FD), where the outcome measures are also binary categories and the binomial distribution is applicable. The 95% CI for the difference in pre- and post-treatment proportions were constructed according to the Bayesian approach proposed in Agresti and Min. 44 These authors refer to the 95% CI for the difference as Bayesian confidence intervals because a 100(1 − α)% interval is obtained for a parameter, choosing the 100(α/2)% and 100(1 − α/2)% percentiles of the posterior distribution for the parameter. In this sense, a Bayesian confidence interval is a region that has posterior probability equal to the desired confidence level. The values for the posterior distribution were randomly generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. All computations were done with the free software R version 3.3.1., using the code provided by Unicomb et al. 30 To ascertain whether the difference between each individual in the case studies' pre- and post-treatment scores is statistically significant, one has to inspect the 95% CI for the difference and see if the interval does not contain the zero value. If it does not, then there has been a reliable change at the 0.05 significance level. To visually assess the significance, the CI were plotted using Microsoft Excel 2013. For each case study, a scatter plot was created representing pre- and post-treatment proportions against each other, together with a reference line of no change. Data points thus represent pre- and post-treatment proportions for each individual in each case study. The upper and lower 95% CI were used to draw the error bars to visually ascertain the level of uncertainty in the difference in pre- and post-treatment proportions. 30 Results Service delivery During the pre-test phase of the project, the teachers from one kindergarten (Jardim de Infância de Santiago in Aveiro) flagged 20 children (20% of the total number of children in that particular kindergarten), with eleven (11/20 = 55%) children needing intervention and nine (9/20 = 45%) not presenting relevant alterations for their age. These nine children showed signs that were deviant from normal development but did not need/justify SLT support, e.g. some children presented phonological processes, but these were considered normal for their age group. All teachers and parents reviewed (with the Speech and Language Therapist) their children's individual reports. Two additional cases from this kindergarten were referred to the UA team by external speech and language therapists and parents. The majority of the children in need of SLT had speech and/or language disorders, having then access to intervention based on proven methodologies according to their needs. In the larger study, the research team established partnerships with a group of 25 kindergartens and schools from the Aveiro region. In this second stage of the project, a group of 128 children were flagged by their teachers. In addition, a group of 11 children were referred by external speech and language therapists and parents mainly due to the specific expertise of the SLT team and mouth-to-mouth publicity about the service creation. The total number of children included in the larger study group was 139, as shown in Fig. 2 . The flagged children were assessed by a team of two speech and language therapists. As seen in Fig. 2, from the 139 children flagged, 46% (64 children) did not present relevant alterations for age, but still a report was made and shared with teachers and parents. The other 54% (75 children) needed SLT and the most common alterations in this group of children were SSD, DLD and FD. From the 75 children who presented alterations, 42 children presented SSD, 20 had DLD and 13 had FD. The results of the flagging processes were in line with screening literature that points a much less accurate estimate of child development when non-formal screening is used. 45 In general, the kindergarten teachers and/or parents reported that children had a low participation and difficulties in social communication and integration with peers. When needed, children were also evaluated by an audiologist, and by a psychologist to assess their non-verbal IQ. These assessments were possible due to the wide network of health professionals working within the UA. After the initial assessment, children entered an intervention program, delivered by the same team of two speech and language therapists. Concerning children with SSD, the average number of intervention sessions were 12, consisting of a phonological-based intervention. Each session had an average duration of 45 min; at the end of each session, the Speech and Language Therapist provided recommendations to parents or kindergarten teachers on how to potentiate the benefits of the therapeutic intervention (e.g. through homework). The specific goals for intervention in children with DLD were reached after an average of 20 sessions with a mean duration of 45 min each. The parents were encouraged to participate in every therapeutic session, to maximise the therapeutic gains. The stuttering intervention processes consisted of four phases, with an average of four sessions per phase. Specifically, related to children who stutter, family interaction patterns were also the focus of intervention to facilitate the child's fluency. Teachers and classroom peers were also involved in the treatment program to raise awareness towards stuttering. Long-term post-intervention assessment was used to monitor their progress in several aspects, including speech and language skills and academic activities. Concerning children with SSD, the percentage of return to assessment 18 months post-intervention was 76% (32/42), with a mean age of 57 months (standard deviation [SD] = 10 months) before intervention start. TFF-ALPE Phonetic subtest mean percentiles were pre 5.9 (SD = 4.0) and post 31.9 (SD = 19.9); TFF-ALPE Phonological subtest mean percentiles were pre 5.0 (SD = 3.4) and post 31.9 (SD = 14.8); TFF-ALPE Phonetic subtest mean raw scores were pre 49/90 = 54% (SD = 10%) and post 77/90 = 86% (SD = 10%). To compare the children's performance before and after the intervention period, the Wilcoxon-signed ranks (unilateral) test was used for all the variables considered. Regarding the percentiles of the TFF-ALPE phonetic and phonological subtests, the non-parametric approach was used since the normality tests rejected the null hypothesis of a normal population. In all other cases (DLD and FD groups), the non-parametric test was used due to the small sample sizes (DLD: N = 10; FD: N = 7). Significant differences between pre- and post-percentiles of the TFF-ALPE phonetic and phonological subtests were found (Z = −4.937, P = 0.000, effect size = 0.62 [large effect] for both the phonetic and phonological subtests). Note that although this study did not include a control group, the natural evolution of the children is taken into account since the percentiles were calculated considering the age group. Typically, developing children mature naturally and the percentiles described in TFF-ALPE incorporate this evolution (each child will tend to keep his percentile along time). Comparing percentiles from pre- to post-intervention moments can be used to detect a non-typical progress in the children's development. Post-intervention academic achievement of the 18 children with SSD that were enrolled in primary school was quite satisfactory: only one child was qualified as not performing ‘good enough’ (insuficiente); 33% of the children in mathematics, 28% in Portuguese language and 50% in social studies were classified as ‘very good’ (muito bom). Ten children (50%) with DLD returned to long-term assessment, with a mean age of 55 months (SD = 8 months) before intervention start. TL-ALPE mean receptive language percentiles were pre 19.7 (SD = 12.4) and post 46.7 (SD = 18.4); TL-ALPE mean expressive language percentiles were pre 9.0 (SD = 7.0) and post 34.5 (SD = 13.6); TL-ALPE mean receptive language raw scores were pre 34/49 = 70% (SD = 9%) and post 43/49 = 87% (SD = 5%); TL-ALPE mean expressive language raw scores were pre 34/76 = 45% (SD = 9%) and post 53/76 = 70% (SD = 6%). Regarding the percentiles of the TL-ALPE receptive and expressive subtests, significant differences were also found between the pre- and post-intervention values (Z = −2.803, P = 0.001, effect size = 0.63 [large effect] for both the receptive and expressive subtests). As for the TFF-ALPE, the natural evolution of the children's performance is taken into account by the fact that we are comparing percentiles, calculated for the appropriate age group at each moment. Only three out of 10 children with DLD assessed at 18 months post-intervention were enrolled in primary school but all with ‘good enough’ (suficiente) to ‘very good’ (muito bom) performance in all areas. Results from the pre-intervention assessment of children who stutter revealed a mean percentage of stuttered syllables of 8.3% (SD = 2.2%), and the presence of associated behaviours, mainly non-verbal (i.e. extremities movements). Mean duration of stuttering moments were 2.9 s (SD = 1.0 s). Feedback collected from teachers and parents revealed a low impact on academic achievements. However, one child stood out on their participation levels at school, due to the avoidance of communication moments. Some negative results were observed in measures of academic achievement that could be attributable to the stuttering impact. Eight out of the 13 (67%) children who stutter returned to post-intervention. All children presented less than 1% of stuttered syllables (mean = 0.6%; SD = 0.2%), a mean duration of stuttering moments lower than 2.0 s (mean = 1.9 s; SD = 1.0 s) and absence of associated behaviours at 18 months post-intervention. Feedback from teachers revealed that academic achievements were no longer impacted by the FD, and that an improvement was observed on fluency during speech activities (e.g. when describing, in class, their weekend activities or vacations), mainly on one child who presented avoidance on classroom participation before fluency intervention. The children who did not return to the long-term follow-up (18 months post-intervention) presented a low value (less than 1%) of stuttered syllables at the end of service delivery (one week post-intervention). Finally, both the percentage of stuttered syllables and the duration of stuttering moments also showed significant differences from pre- to post-intervention (Z = −2.366, P = 0.008, effect size = 0.63 [large effect] for both variables). In spite of the small sample size considered in the last two analysis performed (N = 10 and N = 7), the statistical tests and the large effect sizes obtained suggest that the intervention produced effective changes in the children's performance that would not have been achieved without it. Case studies The three case studies represent areas (SSD; DLD; FD) that are very common in the SLT clinic. Participants selected as case studies were randomly selected. For the SSD client, percentage of correct consonant and phonetic inventory is presented and for the child with DLD, the results of a standardised pre-school language test are reported. For the FD client, the results are presented in terms of percentage of syllable stuttered and the global impact in quality of life. SSD—case study 1 Participant: DB, a 4 years and 1 month-old male, was referred by his kindergarten teacher due to his low intelligibility of speech. Assessment: he was assessed in June 2015. Data related to the case history, collected using University of Aveiro's Case History Form for Child Language, 46 showed no relevant alterations. Further assessment included a phonetic-phonological test—TFF-ALPE; 36 a language test—TL-ALPE; 47 and an oro-motor abilities test—PAOF. 38 He showed normal expressive and receptive language for age and did not present oro-motor alterations. The child was also assessed by a psychologist and an audiologist to establish the diagnosis of SSD (with normal non-verbal IQ and normal hearing). Setting: a pull-out method was used and the child had one-to-one therapy sessions in SLHlab's clinical setting and the caregiver (mother) participated in all sessions (in some session his older brother was also present). Intervention: he then had 12 sessions of phonological-based intervention 34 centred in well-known methodologies. 40–43 The main phonological process targeted was the stopping of fricatives. Progress: DB presented a percentage of consonants correct (PCC) of 56% at pre-intervention that positively evolved to 76% after intervention. Results presented in Fig. 3 revealed that the change between pre- and post-intervention is statistically significant because the 95% CI bars do not cross the reference line. He added to his phonetic inventory the sounds [f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, ɲ, ʀ]. An increase in his intelligibility was noticed and reported by his parents, teacher and peers. DLD—case study 2 Participant: TC, a 3 years and 11 months-old male, was flagged by his kindergarten teacher due to low expressive skills in comparison to his peers. Assessment: TC was assessed in September 2015. University of Aveiro's Case History Form for Child Language 46 was used, revealing no alterations from normal development. Further assessment also included: a phonetic-phonological test—TFF-ALPE; 36 a language test—TL-ALPE; 47 and an oro-motor abilities test—PAOF. 38 He showed alterations in receptive and expressive skills on the language test, on the phonetic-phonological test but no relevant alterations in oro-motor abilities. Setting: a pull-out method was used, and he had one-to-one therapy sessions in SLHlab's clinical setting and the caregiver (grandmother) was present in all sessions. Intervention: language intervention 48,49 over 20 sessions was then provided to the child. Progress: initially, the child showed very low communicative intent, preferring gestures rather than words. He was at percentile 14 in expressive language and percentile five in receptive language according to the TL-ALPE language test. TC presented a total of 32 correct answers in 76 possible for expressive language and a total of 30 correct answers in 49 possible regarding receptive language. After intervention, he improved his communicative intent, started to use more words than gestures and the language test scores evolved positively to percentile 23 in expressive language and percentile 84 in receptive language. He presented a total of 40 correct answers in 76 possible for expressive language and a total of 45 correct answers in 49 possible for the receptive language. Results presented in Fig. 4 revealed that the change between pre- and post-intervention is not statistically significant for expressive language, because the 95% CI bars cross the reference line. Fig. 5 shows that the change between pre- and post-intervention is statistically significant for receptive language because the 95% CI bars do not cross the reference line. FD—case study 3 Participant: DV, a 17-year-old adolescent client who stutters was referred by an external Speech and Language Therapist due to the fact that one of the team's speech and language therapists has a clinical specialisation in FD. Assessment: DV was assessed in October 2015. Data related to the case history was collected using the ‘Stuttering Case History Form—Adolescent/Adult’. 50 To obtain a holistic comprehension of DV as a person who stutters, several methods were implemented during the assessment: collection of three different speech samples (to assess stuttering severity) and administration of the Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering questionnaire, 39 to assess the impact of stuttering in DV's quality of life. Setting: a pull-out method was used, and DV had one-to-one therapy sessions in SLHlab's clinical setting. Intervention: during 14 intervention sessions with DV, the integrated approach of Guitar 50 was followed. Progress: initially, DV presented a frequency of 3.4% of stuttered syllables, with a mean duration of 0.7 s and barely noticeable physical concomitants. The client presented mainly repetitions and audible prolongations. It was concluded that stuttering presented a moderate impact on DV. Post-assessment revealed that the percentage of syllable stuttered (%SS) decreased to 1.5% as well as the impact of stuttering on communication in daily situations and quality of life. Fig. 6 shows that the change between pre- and post-intervention is not statistically significant because the 95% CI bars cross the reference line. Discussion Results showed that the proposed service delivery model can facilitate the detection of children in need of SLT in pre-school and primary school years that do not have the access to adequate support at the moment. When young children start school with speech, language and/or communication needs, they carry a greater risk of developing problems in literacy and numeracy learning. 10,51–54 If language difficulties are resolved early, and oral skills continue to improve at the same rate with development, then school performance will be within the normal range. 52 As the number of children who start school with speech, language and/or communication needs is higher than is recommended due to cuts that schools are facing, 55–59 there are an increasing number of children is advancing in their school path with impairments that will affect their progression in personal and educational life. This will have an impact in their emotional, occupational and educational development that influences the children's quality of life. Early identification and intervention, through a feasible service delivery model may have a role in decreasing the risk of developing secondary disabilities and in reducing the economic burden of communicative impairments in society. 60 It was observed that teachers were aware of children's speech and language alterations, resulting in more than half of the children flagged having relevant alterations and being in need of immediate support. Even the 46% that did not have relevant alterations for their age showed some signs that were deviant from the normal development, but not sufficient to need support, i.e., they showed, for example, some phonological processes in their speech that were not present in most of their peers but these processes were considered normal for age. Some kindergarten teachers flagged these children because they were not sure if these alterations were normal or not. However, the accuracy of the flagging of children by teachers can still be increased if workshops and awareness campaigns are promoted in schools. Early identification and access to high quality services may have a role in decreasing the risk of developing secondary disabilities and in reducing the economic burden of communicative impairments in society. 60 The long-term outcomes investigated, reveal that the therapy delivered, appeared to have lasting effects. This has implications for SLT including reduced therapy times and defining a set of core outcomes. This impact was also exemplified for our service delivery model in the case studies (a similar analysis was implemented for all the cases treated within the project). Regarding case study 1 and 2—receptive language, the 95% CI for the difference in pre- and post-intervention scores were [10.15; 28.48] and [13.79; 44.86] respectively. These ranges do not include the zero value, which means that the increase in PCC and correct answers in the receptive language test are statistically significant. For case study 1, this result means that DB increased his correct production of consonants after intervention. For case study 2, the results showed that the intervention contributed to a significant increase in TC's number of correct answers which means that he improved his receptive language capacities. In terms of case study 2—expressive language and case study 3—the 95% CI for the difference in pre- and post-intervention proportions were [−5.33; 25.60] and [−4.03; 0.03], respectively. Both ranges include the zero value meaning that the change was not statistically significant. Regarding case study 2, the result was expected because the intervention focus was only on receptive language. In spite of the non-significance of change, TC showed some positive progress probably due to an indirect impact of the receptive language intervention. For case study 3, the results reveal some decrease in the %SS; however as the %SS in the first assessment moment was per se very low, it would be difficult to expect a larger change. Qualitatively, the intervention had a greater impact regarding DV's quality of life and attitude towards stuttering. Conclusions This specialised and differentiated care network can constitute an alternative delivery system of SLT services that address the lack of support experienced currently, meeting children's needs and minimising the burden of communication disorders. It is very likely that this will have an impact in literacy, reading and writing acquisition, promoting positive school outcomes that contribute to a better quality of life in children. It would be interesting to analyse this impact in a future longitudinal study assessing the children who participated and had intervention. Also an implementation of this model in a permanent way could benefit more children every year and contribute to close the gap between the number of children needing support and the ones that can have access to it. The use of the 95% CI analysis proved to be suitable for assessing the change in the used measures allowing the illustration of the impact of the intervention in the 3 case studies presented. This model can be seen as an alternative way of responding to the needs of children who are lacking support. In general, it can be concluded that the model can contribute to an increase in the quality of life of the treated children who otherwise would have no access to SLT support. The interventions were always based in well-known methodologies that had been shown previously to be effective. The implementation model can be seen as an available resource that allows the creation of links between kindergartens, schools and clinical population. As future work more research on how teacher-oriented workshops and awareness campaigns influence the accuracy of the flagging is suggested. It would also be interesting to explore the impact of this service delivery on later literacy acquisition.

        "doc_abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier LtdThis paper examines how acoustic characteristics of vowels and consonants reflect intonational differences between polar questions and statements in Polish whispered, semi-whispered and normal speech modes, with particular focus on the spectral characteristics of voiceless consonants as a function of intonation, and across speech modes. The results reveal significant differences in spectral properties of both utterance-final vowels and consonants across statements and polar questions. Questions have higher vowel intensities and show differences in formant frequencies that vary with speech mode. Regarding the consonants, both fricatives and affricates are produced with higher intensity, spectral peaks at higher frequencies, and higher Centre of Gravity and Spectral Standard Deviation values in questions than in statements. Conversely, skewness and kurtosis are lower in questions than in statements. Some spectral features of sibilants, including spectral slopes, show greater question-statement differences in the whispered speech mode than in other speech modes. The finding that some cues are more pronounced in whispered speech suggests that they may compensate for the absence of fundamental frequency in this mode. Most generally, the study shows that speakers produce intended intonation patterns by varying the type and magnitude of cues depending on speech mode.",

Leibniz-Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS) Schützenstr. 18 10-117 Berlin Germany This paper examines how acoustic characteristics of vowels and consonants reflect intonational differences between polar questions and statements in Polish whispered, semi-whispered and normal speech modes, with particular focus on the spectral characteristics of voiceless consonants as a function of intonation, and across speech modes. The results reveal significant differences in spectral properties of both utterance-final vowels and consonants across statements and polar questions. Questions have higher vowel intensities and show differences in formant frequencies that vary with speech mode. Regarding the consonants, both fricatives and affricates are produced with higher intensity, spectral peaks at higher frequencies, and higher Centre of Gravity and Spectral Standard Deviation values in questions than in statements. Conversely, skewness and kurtosis are lower in questions than in statements. Some spectral features of sibilants, including spectral slopes, show greater question-statement differences in the whispered speech mode than in other speech modes. The finding that some cues are more pronounced in whispered speech suggests that they may compensate for the absence of fundamental frequency in this mode. Most generally, the study shows that speakers produce intended intonation patterns by varying the type and magnitude of cues depending on speech mode. Keywords Segment–prosody interaction Sibilants Intonation Whispered speech Polish 1 Introduction This paper assesses the acoustic characteristics of vowels and voiceless obstruents in normal, whispered, and semi-whispered speech from speakers of Polish. Our primary questions are how intonational distinctions between yes–no questions and statements are produced in these different speaking modes, and to what extent the voiceless fricatives and affricates reflect the intonational differences in the three modes. To verify the expected intonational patterns and allow for comparison with past work on whispered speech, we also present data on vowel formants and durations and, for the normal voiced condition and, for the normal voiced condition, the fundamental frequency (F0). The results provide evidence for intonational variations in both vowels and voiceless segments across all speaking modes and speak to the variety of ways in which intonation can be manifested in the speech signal aside from the variations in fundamental frequency usually associated with intonational patterns. The first two sections of the literature review address the relatively new line of work on interactions between segments and prosody in general (Section 1.1) and segments and intonation in particular (Section 1.2). Section 1.3 reviews the acoustic differences between whispered and normal (modal) speech. Semi-whispered speech has not received previous acoustic description. It is included as a third speaking mode here to provide a broader view of how intonational patterns appear in speech conditions where F0 is not reliably available in the speech signal. 1.1 Prosody, segments, and their interaction One goal of this work is to contribute to the growing literature on interactions between segments and prosody. Traditionally, research into speech and language focused on either segments or prosodic patterns (see Kohler, 2012 for an overview). To our knowledge, the earliest studies of segment–prosody interaction dealt with sonority and syllable structure across languages (Hooper, 1976; Selkirk, 1984). In recent decades, more research has explored interactions between segments and prosody, based on the growing awareness of prosodic levels, as described, for example, in Selkirk (1978, 1986), Nespor and Vogel (1986), and Beckman and Pierrehumbert (1986). In these models, which are known Prosodic Hierarchy models, phonological units combine into increasingly larger units: Segments combine to form syllables, which combine to form prosodic feet, and then phonological words and phrases, and finally utterances. The next paragraph provides examples to demonstrate how broadly this general theoretical framework has been applied; we will then focus on how segments, and particularly consonants, vary as a function of intonation (Section 1.2). Numerous prosodic phenomena may impact segmental characteristics. Demonstrations of boundary effects can be found, for example, in Shattuck-Hufnagel and Turk (1998), Fougeron (2001), Cho and Keating (2001, 2009), Byrd and Saltzman (2003), and Katsika (2016). Cho and Keating (2009) observed that vowels in CV syllables had higher amplitudes in domain-initial position, i.e., boundary effects may span multiple segments. Studies demonstrating sentential stress effects include the work of Pierrehumbert (1980) and Sluijter (1995). Although much work in this area has emphasized vowel characteristics, a few studies have documented prosodic variation in consonants as well. For instance, Fougeron and Keating (1997) reported more linguo-palatal contact for /n/ at the beginning of higher prosodic domains; in contrast, /o/ had less linguopalatal contact in domain-final syllables compared to initial and medial positions (see also Fougeron, 2001). Along similar lines, Cho and Keating (2001) observed that Korean alveolar consonants had more extensive articulatory contact and longer durations in higher prosodic domains than in lower domains. Cho and McQueen (2005) found that lexical stress, accent and prosodic constituent size all affected consonant durations in Dutch. Cho (2015) provides a summary of timing effects induced by prosody. 1.2 Intonation and segments In many languages, including Polish, polar questions are characterized by a terminal F0 rise (Wagner, 2008). In the autosegmental framework (e.g., Pierrehumbert, 1980), this is represented as a high boundary tone. Such a description effectively takes F0 to be the primary attribute of intonational differences. On the other hand, Pierrehumbert and Talkin (1992) made the point that F0 need not be the sole carrier of intonational differences, and other authors have recognized that multiple phonetic features may vary as a function of intonation. For example, Ladd (1996:6/2008:4) describes intonation broadly as “the use of suprasegmental phonetic features to convey ‘postlexical’ or sentence-level pragmatic meanings”. The suprasegmental features include fundamental frequency, intensity and duration (Ladd, 1996, p. 6). Grice (2006) also lists multiple phonetic ‘channels’, including segmental features, which can convey intonation in addition to the ‘perceived pitch’ (Grice, 2006, p. 779). In line with this perspective, several studies have described interactions between segments and intonation. As with other investigations of segment–prosody interaction (see Section 1.1), these interactions have mainly concentrated on vowels (e.g., Pierrehumbert, 1980; Prieto, van Santen, & Hirschberg, 1995), even in languages with numerous voiceless consonant clusters, such as Polish or Berber (e.g., Dukiewicz, 1978; Gordon & Nafi, 2012; Roettger & Grice, 2015; Steffen-Batogowa, 1966). This is justifiable if we take F0, obviously found only in voiced segments, to be the main correlate of intonation; indeed, most experimental designs on intonation have explicitly avoided voiceless obstruents since they can lead to micro-prosodic perturbations in the F0 contour of adjacent voiced segments and interrupt the smooth patterns of F0 (e.g., Kohler, 1990). However, recent studies have revealed that voiceless segments are also sensitive to intonational changes, suggesting that excluding them from investigation limits our understanding of intonational variation. Niebuhr (2008) found that the aspiration of German /t/ in utterance-final position under two accent contours distinguished by peak F0 placement differed in duration, intensity and spectral peak frequencies (specifically, burst frequencies were shifted to higher regions in high-F0 conditions). Furthermore, the German fricatives /ʃ/ and /x/ have been seen to vary in the Centre of Gravity (COG) depending on intonation contours: in high-raising (surprised) questions the sibilants were produced with higher COG and compressed COG ranges whereas in falling (concluding) statements they showed lower COG values and higher ranges (Niebuhr, 2009). Finally, Niebuhr, Lill, and Neuschulz (2011) and Niebuhr (2012) investigated the German voiceless sibilants /s/ and /ʃ/ in different intonation contexts. They reported that the fricatives had higher COG values in questions than statements. In light of these findings, three questions arise: First, to what extent can they be generalized to languages other than German? Second, the previous studies investigated single consonants appearing in coda position. Do longer voiceless sequences display similar characteristics? For example, intonational effects in preceding vowels might carry over into a single following voiceless consonant, but such effects might dissipate over time, i.e., not be as salient in clusters as in singletons. The work of Cho and Keating (2009; see Section 1.1) did indicate that some prosodic effects could span multiple segments, but their results were for boundary effects and not intonation; moreover, vowels and consonants could behave differently in this regard. Finally, all results on intonational variation in consonants have come from voiced speech. It remains unclear to what extent similar relations can be found in speech modes where F0 may be partially absent as in semi-whispered speech or totally absent as in whispered speech. Past work has suggested that whispered speech, despite lacking an F0 contour, still allows listeners to discern some aspects of intonation (e.g., Heeren & van Heuven, 2009; cf. next section). This observation leads to fundamental questions about how intonational patterns are manifested 1 We use the word 'manifested' here to emphasize the production-based nature of our work; that is, our question is to what extent acoustic differences are available in the speech signal. Determining the degree to which listeners use such features would require a detailed perception study, beyond the bounds of the current work. 1 in whispered speech. The second focus of this work is thus to explore prosodic variation in non-phonated speech modes. Which parameters might allow listeners to differentiate between whispered questions and statements? The next section summarizes previous research on whispered and semi-whispered speech giving special attention to segment–prosody interaction. 1.3 Whispered and semi-whispered speech Work on whispered speech has established that this unphonated speaking mode conveys considerable information to listeners, including aspects of speaker differences as well as vowel and consonant identity (e.g., Kallail & Emanuel, 1984; Tartter, 1989). The basic acoustic differences between voiced (modal) speech and whisper have also been described in some detail. Overall, whispered vowels have decreased amplitudes compared to voiced vowels; Ito, Takeda, and Itakura (2005) obtained a difference of about 20–25dB across the spectral envelope. Some studies also observed that whispered vowels are longer than their voiced counterparts (Schwartz, 1968; Sharf, 1967), whereas others found no differences (Heeren, 2015a). One of the most widely-studied aspects of whisper is vowel formant frequencies (e.g., Heeren, 2015a; Heeren & van Heuven, 2011; Higashikawa, Nakai, Sakakura, & Takahashi, 1996; Kallail & Emanuel, 1984; Li & Xu, 2005; Meyer-Eppler, 1957; Morris, 2003; Thomas, 1969; Sharifzadeh, 2010). For example, Ito et al. (2005) reported that formants of Japanese /a, i, u, e, o/ shifted towards higher frequencies in the whispered speech mode as compared to the voiced speech mode. F1 in whispered vowels was about 1.3–1.6 times higher than in the corresponding voiced vowels; for F2 the increase was in the range of 1.0–1.2. Kallail and Emanuel (1984) found systematically higher values of the first three formants in whispered American vowels /i, u, æ, a, ʌ/ compared to the voiced counterparts. The data also revealed that F1 underwent larger changes than F2 or F3. Along similar lines, Eklund and Traunmüller (1996), investigating ten Swedish vowels in stressed positions in whispered and voiced speech, found that F1 was raised more than F2 in whispered speech. Thus, there is a general consensus that vowel formants are raised in whispered speech compared to voiced speech, especially for F1 but possibly for higher formants as well. In a modeling study, Swerdlin, Smith, and Wolfe (2010) demonstrated that the increased glottal areas associated with whisper had the strongest and most consistent effects on F1. However, formant changes in whisper may vary across vowels (Meyer-Eppler, 1957); further, some investigations suggested that increased values of F2 as well as F1 may correlate with pitch percepts in whisper (Higashikawa & Minifie, 1999; Thomas, 1969). Many studies of whisper investigated individual vowels irrespective of their prosodic position and often produced in isolation. However, some work has attended to how prosody influences the spectral properties of whispered vowels. Higashikawa et al. (1996) asked 12 Japanese informants to produce the vowel /a/ in voiced speech and in whisper at ordinary, high, and low pitches. The results showed that the F1 frequency was significantly higher (i) in ordinary whispering than in voiced speech and (ii) in high-pitched whispering than in low-pitched whispering. F1, F2 and F3 all had a tendency to increase in high-pitched whispering and decrease in low-pitched whispering as compared to ordinary whispering. Heeren (2015a) examined the Dutch vowels /a, i, u/ in CVCs produced at low, mid, and high pitches in whispered and voiced speech. Along with higher F1 and F2 in whisper, the author reported a more extreme difference in spectral balance (defined as the intensity difference between the 0.5–2kHz and 2–8kHz bands) as a function of low vs. high pitch targets in whispered speech as compared to modal speech. Intensity was lower in whispered than in modal speech and lower in /i/ and /u/ than /a/ in accordance with intrinsic vowel intensity (Lehiste, 1970). Furthermore, Centre of Gravity values (calculated from 0.05 to 8kHz) were higher in whispered than in normal speech and COG differences between high vs. low and high vs. medium pitch were larger in whispered than in normal speech. Neither the speech mode nor the pitch target affected the duration of vowels. The work of Meyer-Eppler (1957) on German suggested that amplitude could play a role in perceived pitch in whisper (see also Thomas, 1969). More recent work has evaluated the role of amplitude in the perception of whispered tones. Whalen and Xu (1992) showed that in the absence of F0 and formant structure, the amplitude information for tones 2, 3 and 4 in Mandarin was fairly distinct and was used by listeners as a cue for tone identification. The authors suggested that differences in amplitude gave rise to weak F0 percepts because their original stimuli, i.e. before removing F0 and formants, were characterized by a strong correlation between amplitude and F0. However, Abramson (1972) did not find clear evidence for a role of amplitude in perceiving whispered Thai tones. Little attention has been devoted to consonants in whispered speech. In the case of tonal/intonational differences, this might have been a natural extension of the emphasis on vowels and sonorants in studies of intonation in voiced speech. Nevertheless, the relative neglect of consonants in whisper is somewhat curious insofar as consonants are important carriers of information in the speech signal (cf. Tarttar, 1989). Yet it is also the case that whispered speech looks totally different from voiced speech: Due to the lack of periodic glottal excitation and to the presence of noise excitation voice source harmonics are completely absent and spectrograms are dominated by strong aperiodic energy. Therefore, as stated by Lim (2011, p. 30), “the obvious remaining indicators of the message for whispered speech appear to be largely the formant energies.” It may be that the lack of appropriate techniques to study spectral properties of voiceless consonants has limited investigations of obstruents in whispered speech. One possibility that we will evaluate is that intonation patterns are conveyed in different speech modes by means of cue trading (see Repp, 1982, for a review) involving spectral features, particularly of consonants. Cue-trading is defined as the use of different acoustic cues guiding the perception of linguistic distinctions, where several cues (perhaps with differing magnitudes) can integrate to form a robust percept, in contrast to a single major cue being sufficient to generate the perceptual outcome. In the case of intonation patterns, we must specifically ask what other acoustic features may be available to listeners when the F0 is absent, as in whispered and semi-whispered speech. One of the few acoustic studies of whispered consonants was conducted by Jovičić and Šarić (2008), who investigated duration and average root mean square intensity (RMS) of 25 Serbian consonants. The results revealed that the RMS intensity of voiced consonants was reduced by as much as 25dB in the whispered mode, whereas voiceless consonants showed almost unchanged RMS intensity. Whispered consonants were, on average, about 10% longer in duration. Schwartz (1972) reported that stop closure durations for /p/ and /b/ were significantly longer in whisper than in voiced speech, whereas durations for /m/ did not differ between the two modes (cf. also Osfar, 2011). Ito et al. (2005) found that ‘voiced’ consonants in the whispered speech mode had lower energy at low frequencies, up to 1.5kHz, and their spectra were flatter than in voiced speech. Similar results have been obtained by Lim (2011, p. 70), who pointed out that greater spectral tilt in normal speech, i.e., stronger energy in the low frequency bands as opposed to high frequency bands, can be explained by the low-frequency energy provided by the glottal sound source. Finally, Heeren’s (2015b) study investigated duration, intensity, COG and spectral balance, comparing the difference in intensity between the 0.5–2 and 2–8kHz frequency regions, in spectra of Dutch /f/ and /s/. The parameters were excerpted from nonsense VCV sequences spoken at different pitch targets (low, mid, high) in whispered and voiced speech. The results revealed that in both speech modes durations were longer for lower pitch targets. The Centre of Gravity increased for higher intended pitches in voiced and whispered speech. Intensity decreased with lower pitch targets but the differences were only about 1dB. The literature on semi-whisper is quite sparse. A few instrumental studies have evaluated “stage whisper”, which we suspect may be similar or comparable to the Polish semi-whisper, but they have concentrated on phonatory characteristics (e.g., Yan, Ahmad, Kenduk, & Bless, 2005); to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated vowels or consonants in semi-whispered speech. This speech mode, as our data shows, is characterized by irregular, i.e., interrupted F0 not only in the case of voiceless segments but also in voiced ones. Its amplitudes are lower than modal speech and higher than whispered speech (see also Section 2 for more informantion). It is worth emphasizing that in some languages, including Polish, the semi-whispered speech mode is captured by a specific word so that speakers immediately know that they should find a way to speak in a mode which lies between modal and whispered ones (see the Methods section for details). This additional non-modal speech mode allows us to broaden our investigation into the ways in which intonational differences may be realized. 1.4 Summary and research questions Much recent research on voiced speech has highlighted the role that segments play in prosody, and conversely the way prosody affects segments. However, this interdependence has been investigated only to a limited degree thus far with respect to intonation. Very little is known about spectral and other acoustic changes of voiceless consonants under varying intonation patterns, and especially how any such intonational effects on consonants are realized in speech modes partially or totally lacking phonation. Only the work of Heeren (2015b), limited to Dutch, showed that acoustic parameters of whispered fricatives are contingent upon pitch targets. Even for voiced speech, interactions between consonants and intonation have only been investigated for German. Finally, to our knowledge, semi-whispered speech has not been investigated with regard to this interaction at all. Accordingly, this study pursues three goals. (1) First, it aims to provide new insights into the realisation of intended intonation in whispered, semi-whispered and modal speech modes in Polish, a Slavic language. Are spectral properties of both vowels and voiceless consonants contingent upon the intended intonation, i.e., questions vs. statements? We hypothesize, following the studies described in Sections 1.2–1.3, that vowels in whispered speech are generally characterized by higher formant frequencies and longer duration, and that formant frequencies are higher in questions than statements. Furthermore, we expect that consonants will be produced with higher Centre of Gravity in questions than in statements (Niebuhr, 2012). With respect to the semi-whispered speech mode, where F0 is partially present, we predict that vowel and consonant properties will tend to fall between those of normal and whispered speech. Since there are no studies on semi-whispered speech our hypothesis is rather intuitive. (2) Second, we seek a better understanding of the potential role of voiceless segments in conveying intonation patterns across speech modes. We specifically investigate whether voiceless consonants, especially those not adjacent to vowels, vary with intonation patterns and whether question-statement differences in voiceless segments are found in all three speech modes. Is the lack of F0 compensated for in whispered speech and semi-whispered speech? How could acoustic cue-trading be organized when two contrasting patterns of intonation are produced in whispered and semi-whispered speech vs. modal speech? We predict that all three speech modes will show acoustic differences as a function of the intended intonation. In particular, we conjecture that due to the missing F0 in whispered speech, other acoustic cues will take over its function and contribute to expressing differences between statements and questions. We also hypothesize that spectral parameters of voiceless consonants (e.g., Centre of Gravity) will show more pronounced question-statement differences in whispered speech than in voiced speech, which suggests possible compensation for the lack of F0 in whisper. We also anticipate that some cues may distinguish questions vs. statements exclusively in whisper. (3) Third, do longer voiceless sequences reflect intonational variations? Are there differences between segments within a cluster? A priori, we hypothesize that longer voiceless sequences are sensitive to different intonation patterns, similar to what has been found for short voiceless sequences. It might, however, be the case that intonational variations in sequence-final, sentence-final consonants are less pronounced than in preceding consonants. To address these questions, we carry out detailed acoustic analyses that extend the methods used in previous work. Specifically, we obtain spectral moments and slopes using mulitaper spectra. This sophisticated technique is particularly well-suited for measurements of fricatives but has not been used before for investigating interactions of segments and prosody across speech modes. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the methodology of our experiment and in Section 3 its results, focussing on acoustic correlates of intonation encoded in vowels (3.1) and consonants (3.2). A summary of the results is presented in 3.3. Section 4 is devoted to discussion of the results and conclusions. 2 Methods In order to answer the questions in 1.4 we conducted an acoustic speech production experiment on Polish, a language which provides suitable test material due to its abundance of complex consonant clusters, including in coda position. For testing our hypotheses we recorded eight different items ending in clusters consisting of a voiceless retroflex fricative followed by a retroflex affricate. Each item was presented in a pair: a polar question (e.g., Widzi ten blu[ʂʈ͡ʂ]? ‘Does he see the ivy?’) was followed by a statement (Widzi ten blu[ʂʈ͡ʂ]. ‘He sees the ivy.’). The production of the intonational difference was facilitated by the fact that questions were always followed by statements and the statements were naturally interpreted as answers to the questions. All target words were monosyllabic (see Appendix Table 1). The polar question was expected to be produced with a rising intonation and the statement with a low/falling intonation in accordance with results of previous studies of Polish intonation, e.g., Wagner (2008). Differences between the two types of intonation were independently confirmed by the measurement results provided below (see Section 3). In Polish the sentence stress falls on the sentence final content word, i.e., the last stressed syllable in a sentence (Rubach & Booij, 1985) and the boundary tone is high (H%) in polar questions and low in statements (L%) (Wagner, 2008). In both the statements and polar questions examined in the present study the sentence final intonation contour reflects a combination of pitch accent (sentence stress) and boundary tone. In order to compare the realisation of intonation across modes we recorded the pairs described above in three different speech modes in a fixed order: normal, whispered and semi-whispered. Since changing the speech mode within an extremely short period of time could be a very challenging and error-prone task for our speakers, we preferred a fixed order with respect to the speech mode. This strategy in fact enabled the speakers to change the modes without any problems. It is also worth emphasizing that our speakers did not have difficulties understanding what we meant by semi-whispered speech since in Polish there is a word półszeptem ‘half-whispered’/‘semi-whispered’ which means that generally one speaks quieter than normally but does not whisper. The fact that Polish, unlike many other languages, has a specific lexical item for this speech mode is another factor that makes it a useful language for investigating the questions at hand, in contrast to languages that have no such word. Fig. 1 presents the waveforms, spectrograms and F0 curves (in semitones) of the polar question Widzi ten blu[ʂʈ͡ʂ]? ‘Does he see the ivy?’ produced in normal, whispered and semi-whispered speech-modes. Fig. 2 presents the same polar question sentence (in normal speech mode) along with the corresponding statement (i.e., the answer to the question). As can be seen, the F0 contours for the polar question and statement conditions are typically rising and falling, respectively (see also Wagner, 2008). As noted above, the pitch accent falls on the final word and is conflated with the boundary tone. It can also be seen that in semi-whispered speech the amplitude is lower and F0 is reduced in comparison to the normal speech mode (ca. 100ms of the vowel portion before the sentence-final consonants is devoiced). Other differences are reported in the Results section. Sixteen native speakers of Polish (eight male), aged 20–52years (mean 24.93, standard deviation 9.2), took part in the experiment. All speakers were monolingual, lived in Szczecin and spoke Standard Polish. They were asked to read a list of sentences in a non-randomized speech mode order starting with a normal speech mode, followed by whispered and semi-whispered speech modes so that they could easily pre-plan a given mode. The sentence list was read three times, but each time the items (but not the speech modes) were randomized. All recordings were conducted in a sound-proof room at the Electrical Engineering Department of the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin using a TLM103 microphone (20cm distance from lips) connected to a ProTools system with a Digi 003 interface (sampling rate 44100Hz). The items were analysed with PRAAT (version 5.3.57, Boersma & Weenink, 2014) and MATLAB (version R2007b, MathWorks, 2007). In total, measurements of 4608 sibilants were taken [8 items×2 intonation types (rising, falling)×3 speech modes (normal, semi-whispered, whispered)×2 sibilant types (fricative, affricate)×3 repetitions×16 speakers]. Although the focus of the present paper is on the analysis of consonants we also examined vowels in order to gain a more complete insight into the realization of different intonation contours. Thus, we also measured 2304 vowel tokens. The difference in the number of vocalic and sibilant tokens arises from the fact that each lexical item contained one vowel but two sibilants, i.e., a fricative and an affricate. All measured vowels preceded the coda clusters in question. We examined the following acoustic parameters of both vowels and consonants, as listed in (1). The parameters listed in (f), (g) and (h) were calculated at the midpoint of the sibilant noise for each fricative and affricate. As indicated above, these measures were chosen to follow on previous work and also to employ contemporary methods designed specifically to evaluate fricative acoustics. (1) Parameters: Vowels: (a) Mean intensity over the complete duration of the vowel (Praat algorithm, standard values). (b) Maximum and mean of F0 of the vowel, for normal voiced speech only. 2 Due to the complete absence of the F0 in whispered speech and the partial absence of the F0 in semi-whispered speech (where the F0 cannot always be reliably extracted) we did not analyse F0 in semi-whispered and whispered speech modes. 2 (c) F0 difference between the vowel offset and onset. (d) Formant frequencies F1, F2, F3 at the acoustic vowel midpoint, using the formant extraction algorithm of PRAAT 3 For all productions we manually checked that the formant algorithm neither missed formants nor included spurious peaks that did not represent formants. If necessary we manually corrected the formant values found by the algorithm. 3 , with the following parameter settings: maximum formant frequency: 5000Hz; number of formants: 3; window length: 25ms. (e) Duration of the vowel. Consonants (all calculated from the multitaper spectra using Matlab): (f) Spectral Centre of Gravity (COG, first spectral moment), its standard deviation (STD, second spectral moment), skewness (third spectral moment), and kurtosis (fourth spectral moment). (g) Spectral regression slopes (Jesus & Shadle, 2002; Lousada, Jesus, & Pape, 2012): m1 is the slope of the spectral regression line for the frequency range between 500Hz and 3000Hz, and m2 is the slope of the spectral regression line for the range between 3000Hz and 11,000Hz (see Fig. 3 ). The 3000Hz value was chosen as the reference value because previous work showed this to be the approximate mean frequency of the highest-amplitude spectral peak for the retroflex place of articulation (see Stevens, 1998; Żygis et al., 2012). (h) Frequency of the highest spectral peak of the frication noise in the range from 2 to 4kHz. (i) Mean intensity over the complete phoneme duration. (j) Phoneme duration of the fricative and affricate. We computed multitaper spectra with 12ms windows for the frication noise at midpoint using a 512 point Hamming window. The power spectral density (PSD) was estimated via the Thomson multitaper method (linear combination with unity weights of individual spectral estimates and the default FFT length) available in the MathWorks Signal Processing Toolbox Version 6. All above mentioned acoustic parameters for the consonants have been found to be useful in the analysis of fricatives (Jesus & Shadle, 2002; Żygis et al., 2012). In addition, multitaper analysis provides for acoustic analysis of fricatives that is superior to that based on traditional spectral algorithms. Specifically, compared to standard spectral estimation techniques, multitaper analysis provides a very effective way to reduce the bias of the spectral estimates when calculated over short intervals of the data, and is thus highly suited to examining stochastic parts of the speech signal. Fig. 3 shows 10 multitaper spectra from one individual speaker, the overlaid mean spectrum and the computation of the regression lines m1 and m2, with the endpoint/startpoint F ‾ . All statistical analyses were conducted in the R environment software (version 3.0.2, R Development Core Team, 2010). Linear mixed effect models were employed for studying the influence of Speech Mode [modal, semi-whispered and whispered], Intonation [rise (questions) vs. fall (statements)], Sex [male, female] and Repetition as well as their interaction on the variables listed in (1). To minimize the Type I error (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013) a maximized random structure was included as well: random intercepts for participants and items as well as their slopes for Speech Mode, Intonation, Repetition and their interactions were added to the initial model. Very high correlations found between random-effects terms were eliminated. (No high correlations between fixed effects were observed). The maximized models were tested against less complex models by means of likelihood ratio tests and the best fit model was taken as the final model. Finally, we also corrected for multiple comparisons by using the Tukey test. All p-values reported in the paper are based on the Satterthwaite approximation available in the package ‘lmerTest’ (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2015) which includes tests for linear mixed-effect models implemented in the ‘lme4’ package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015). The results section includes mean values and p-values for significant findings; full LME output is provided for significant effects on all dependent measures in the Appendix tables. 3 Results Our results indicate that several acoustic cues are used to differing extents when questions versus statements are produced in various speech modes. The presentation of the results follows the parameter listing displayed in (1). 3.1 Vowels To ensure that participants produced expected differences between normal, semi-whispered and whispered speech we calculated the mean intensity of the vowels. The results point to the lowest mean intensity in whispered speech (47dB) in comparison to semi-whispered (62dB, p <0.001) and modal speech (71dB, p <0.001; see Table 2 in the Appendix). The results also reveal that mean intensity is significantly higher in questions (Q) than in statements (S) in all three speech modes (whispered: Q 49dB vs. S 44dB, p <0.001, semi-whispered: Q 64dB vs. S 60dB, p <0.001) and modal speech mode (Q 74dB vs. S 68dB, p <0.001). Furthermore, interactions between phonation and intonation type are highly significant (p <0.001); see Fig. 4 . Note that the boxes in Fig. 4 and all remaining box plots correspond to the 25th to 75th percentile range, black lines in the boxes represent medians, and whiskers correspond to ±1.5 inter-quartile range; outliers, i.e., data above or below this range are represented as points in the graph. To verify expected intonational patterns in questions and statements, we investigated the F0 maximum and the F0 mean of the vowel preceding the sibilant cluster in modal speech (cf. (1b)). The results, presented in semitones, 4 The calculations were based on the reference value of 100Hz, which is one of the standards in calculating semitones from Hz frequency values. 4 indeed show that average values for both F0 maximum and F0 mean are significantly higher in questions than in statements (F0 max: Q 18.66 vs. S 7.42, p <0.001, F0 mean: Q 14.29 vs. S 5.78, p <0.001, see Appendix Tables 3,4 and Fig. 5 ). As expected, average values for F0 maximum and F0 mean are lower for male than female speakers (F0 max: male 8.39 vs. female 17.10, p <0.001; F0 mean: male 5.21 vs. female 14.09, p <0.001; see Tables 3,4). Recall that due to the complete absence of the F0 in whispered speech and the partial absence of the F0 in semi-whispered speech we did not analyse this parameter in those two modes since we could not estimate it reliably. We also calculated the F0 difference between the vowel offset and onset (cf. (1c)). This measure likewise points to an average F0 increase in questions (female 8.23 vs. male 7.86, p <0.001) and average falling F0 in statements (female −1.61 vs. male −2.73, p <0.001) confirming our initial assumptions about F0 differences in Polish intonation patterns; cf. also Wagner (2008). The absence of F0 in whispered speech leads us to a key question for the present study, namely: How can an intonational distinction between questions and statements be produced in whispered speech if the F0, the most important correlate of intonation, is not available to play a distinguishing role? First, our results point to the importance of formants. Since the vowel preceding the clusters was not always the same due to lexical restrictions (cf. Appendix) we will present results on the two most distinctive and most frequent vowels in our data base, viz., the low vowel /a/ and the high back vowel /u/. The data show that the mean F1 is significantly higher in whispered speech than in semi-whispered and modal speech (whispered 954Hz vs. semi-whispered 478Hz, p <0.001, modal 595Hz, p <0.001; see Appendix Table 5). Questions are produced with higher mean F1s than statements in whispered speech (Q 992Hz vs. S 914Hz, p <0.001) and modal speech (Q 628Hz vs. S 560Hz, p <0.001). In contrast, questions in semi-whispered speech have lower average F1s than statements (Q 466Hz vs. S 491Hz, p <0.05). As expected, female speakers produce higher mean F1s than male speakers (female 735Hz vs. male 619Hz, p <0.001). Also as expected, the average F1 of /u/ is significantly lower than that of /a/ (/u/ 829Hz vs. /a/ 1071Hz, p <0.05). (Note that the values of F1 for /u/ are extremely high in whispered speech as compared to semi-whispered and modal speech.) Lastly, the interaction of phonation and intonation type is highly significant (p <0.001). Fig. 6 presents the results. Similar to F1, the mean second formant frequency of vowels is significantly higher in whispered speech as compared to semi-whispered and modal speech (whispered 1436Hz vs. semi-whispered 1165Hz, p <0.001, modal 1155Hz, p <0.001; see Appendix Table 6). Questions are produced with higher average F2s than statements in whispered speech (Q 1464Hz vs. S 1407Hz, p <0.001), and with lower average F2s in semi-whispered speech (Q 1135Hz vs. S 1195Hz, p <0.01). No F2 differences are found in modal speech. Female speakers have higher mean F2s than male speakers (female 1358Hz vs. male 1185Hz, p <0.001). Finally, the interaction of phonation and intonation type is highly significant (p <0.001). Fig. 7 presents the results. The third formant frequency is higher on average in whispered than in modal speech (whispered 2693 vs. modal 2587, p <0.01; see Appendix Table 7) but does not differ from semi-whispered speech. Questions are produced with higher mean F3 than statements in whisper (Q 2748Hz vs. S 2636Hz, p <0.001) and modal speech (Q 2623Hz vs. S 2552Hz, p <0.01). No differences between male and female speakers are observed. Fig. 8 illustrates the results. Regarding vowel duration (cf. (1d)), whispered vowels are generally longer than vowels produced in semi-whispered speech (mean log whispered −0.83 vs. mean log semi-whispered −0.89, p <0.001; see Table 8) and modal speech mode (mean log −0.89, p <0.001). No significant differences in vowel duration are found between statements and questions in any speech mode. 3.2 Fricatives and affricates 3.2.1 Spectral moments First we will provide results for spectral moments, the parameters that have been used most frequently for sibilant description in past work. Next we will show the measures that, in our view, provide a clearer and more accurate representation of frication noise characteristics, i.e., spectral slopes and locations of specific spectral peaks (cf. Fig. 3). The first spectral moment, i.e., COG, is significantly lower on average in whispered speech than in semi-whispered speech (whispered 3339Hz vs. semi-whisper 3466Hz, p <0.001; see Table 9) and normal speech (4540Hz, p <0.001). The mean COG values are significantly higher for questions than for statements across all speech modes (whispered: Q 3579Hz vs. S 3088Hz, p <0.001; semi-whispered: Q 3582Hz vs. S 3354Hz, p <0.001; modal: Q 4823Hz vs. S 4256Hz, p <0.001). Fricatives exhibit higher mean COG values than affricates (fricatives 4127Hz vs. affricates 3434Hz, p <0.001). Furthermore, repetition has a significant effect on average COG values, which were higher in later repetitions (p <0.001). 5 The repetition effect for COG does not yield to simple explanation, and no other measure showed a significant effect of this factor. 5 Finally, it should be noted that the interaction between phonation and intonation type was highly significant (p <0.001) with respect to COG and all other parameters presented below apart from duration. The Appendix tables show the statistical details. The results for COG are illustrated in Fig. 9 . For the second spectral moment, whispered speech displays a significantly higher mean standard deviation (STD) than semi-whispered (whispered 1688 vs. semi-whispered 1796, p <.01) and modal speech (1995, p <.001; see Table 10). Only in whispered and semi-whispered speech does average STD differ in the production of questions and statements, being higher in questions (whispered: Q 1758 vs. S 1615, p <.001; semi-whispered: Q 1830 vs. S 1763, p <.05). Fricatives display higher STD than affricates (fricatives 1990 vs. affricates 1753, p <.001). With respect to skewness, the third spectral moment, our results indicate significant differences between whispered and other speech modes. Average skewness is significantly higher in whispered speech compared to semi-whispered (whispered 1.82 vs. semi-whispered 1.66, p <0.001; see Table 11) and modal speech (0.89, p <0.001). The data show lower mean skewness values for questions than statements in whispered speech only (Q 1.56 vs. S 2.11, p <0.001). Lastly, frication in fricatives displays lower mean skewness values than in affricates (fricatives 1.23 vs. affricates 1.67, p <0.001). Fig. 10 presents the results. The fourth spectral moment, kurtosis, has significantly higher average values in whispered than in semi-whispered speech (whispered 19.59 vs. semi-whispered 11.05, p <0.001; see Table 12) and normal speech mode (3.23, p <0.001). As for comparing questions to statements, average kurtosis differs in whispered and semi-whispered speech: it is lower in questions than in statements (whispered Q 10.76 vs. S 18.80, p <0.001; semi-whispered: Q 8.92 vs. S. 11.35). Lastly, mean kurtosis is significantly lower in fricatives than affricates (fricatives 4.84 vs. affricates 8.55, p <0.001). The results are illustrated in Fig. 11 . 3.2.2 Spectral tilt and peak frequencies Fig. 12 shows spectra, averaged over items and speakers, for the fricatives and affricates in the three speech modes and two intonation contexts. (The double-peaked nature of the spectra is discussed below, as are amplitude differences). The figure also shows the m1 and m2 slopes (cf. Fig. 3 above). The m1 slope measure reflects the balance of low-frequency energy in the spectrum relative to the lowest-frequency spectral peak which in these data is generally around 2–3kHz. (Recall that this slope measure was taken over the frequency range 500–3000Hz, so that very low-frequency energy is excluded.) The statistical results show that mean m1 turns out to be significantly lower, i.e., less steep, in whispered than in modal speech mode (whispered 4.82 vs. modal 5.71, p <0.001; see Table 13) and semi-whispered speech mode (4.97, p <0.001). This may reflect the stronger balance of frequencies below 1000Hz, i.e., below the spectral minimum, for whisper (see spectra). Only in whispered speech is a significant difference observed between questions and statements; namely whispered fricatives display higher average m1 values in questions than in statements (Q 5.35 vs. S 4.28, p <0.001). A steeper slope in whispered questions suggests that this combination of intonation and speaking mode leads to increased excitation of the main spectral peak (compare the relative amplitudes of questions and statements across modes in Fig. 12). In addition, fricatives are produced with a higher mean m1 than affricates (fricatives 5.91 vs. affricates 4.43, p <0.05). The spectral slope m2 at the midpoint of the sibilant is, on average, less steep in whispered than in modal speech (whispered −2.18 vs. modal −2.58, p <0.001; see Table 14) and in semi-whispered speech (−2.25, p <0.001). Questions are produced with a steeper m2 in comparison to statements in whispered (Q −2.32 vs. S −2.02, p <0.001), semi-whispered (Q −2.3 vs. S −2.2, p <0.001) and modal speech (Q −2.62 vs. S −2.54, p <0.01). In Fig. 12 this is evident as the greater amplitude difference between the question and statement for the second spectral peak compared to the first, consistent across all plots. Fricatives have steeper m2 values than affricates (fricatives −2.46 vs. affricates −2.21, p <0.001). Since we found that nearly all retroflex spectra had two major peaks (see Fig. 12), we refined the calculation of the highest amplitude spectral peak to the range from 2kHz to 4kHz, i.e., to the frequency region where according to previous studies the major broad (and only) spectral peak is expected for this retroflex place of articulation. 6 As stated in Section 2, for this place of articulation the literature describes one broad spectral peak around 3kHz. We are not sure at the moment what phenomenon causes the additional spectral peak. For this reason we limited the frequency range for the computation of the major broad peak which is associated with the resonance of the front cavity and thus codes how anteriorly the fricatives are articulated. 6 In this selected frequency range, the highest peak has a lower average value in whispered speech than in modal speech (whispered 2651Hz vs. modal 2932Hz, p <0.001; see Table 15). Questions are produced with a higher mean peak than statements in whispered (Q 2749Hz vs. S 2549Hz, p <0.001), semi-whispered (Q 2690Hz, vs. S 2586Hz, p <0.001) and modal speech (Q 3026Hz vs. S 2836Hz, p <0.001). There is no difference between fricatives and affricates with respect to the frequency of the highest spectral peak. The results are shown in Fig. 13 . As with vowel intensity (Section 3.1), the fricative intensity measure also clearly indicates differences across the three speech modes: average values are lower for whispered than semi-whispered (whispered 49.84dB vs. semi-whispered 50.10dB, p <0.001; see Table 16 and Fig. 14) and modal speech modes (57.30dB, p <0.001, see Fig. 14 ). Furthermore, values are higher on average in questions than in statements across all three speech modes (whispered speech: Q 51.90dB vs. S 47.70dB, p <0.001; semi-whispered: Q 50.94dB vs. S 49.43dB, p <0.001; modal: Q 59.76dB vs. S 54.95dB, p <0.001). Fricatives display a higher mean intensity than affricates (54.60dB vs. 50.20dB, p <0.001). The magnitude of the intensity difference between whisper and semi-whisper is much smaller for the fricative noise than that observed for the vowels (cf. Fig. 4 above). Lastly, the mean log transformed sibilant duration is longer in whispered speech than in semi-whispered speech (whispered −0.84 vs. semi-whispered −0.85, p <0.001; see Table 17) and modal speech (−0.86, p <0.001). However, the sibilants show similar durations in questions and statements across all three speech modes. As expected, fricatives have shorter mean durations than affricates (fricatives −0.89 vs. affricates −0.82, p <0.001), see Fig. 15 . 3.3 Summary of the results The results are generally in line with past studies of acoustic differences between whisper and voiced speech. For example, we observed, as many past authors, that intensities are lower, durations are longer, and vowel formants are higher in whisper than in modal speech (see Section 1.3 above). With the exception of F3, whisper vs semi-whisper comparisons showed the same general patterns as whisper-modal differences. Of most interest here, the data also indicate that, in Polish, intonational differences between questions and statements are reflected in the acoustic characteristics of both vowels and consonants. With respect to vowels, the results are largely consistent with outcomes of previous intonational research. The intensity at the acoustic midpoint of the vowel is higher in questions as opposed to statements (Heeren & van Heuven, 2009, 2011). No question-statement difference in vowel duration was found in any speech mode, comparable with the findings obtained by Heeren and van Heuven (2009) for whispered Dutch. Questions were produced with a higher F1 and F3 than statements in whispered and modal speech modes. Questions had higher F2s than statements in whispered speech only. The results are also in accordance with Heeren and van Heuven (2009) who found that /ə/ in whispered Dutch had higher F1 and F2 frequencies in questions than in statements. The results for F1 and F2 could suggest that when producing questions the articulatory vowel settings are more open and more fronted than when producing statements, especially in whisper. The reversed direction of the formant differences between questions and statements in semi-whisper is difficult to interpret given the virtual absence of previous acoustic work on this mode; the finding does, however, contribute to the general conclusion that intonational patterns may be realized differently across speaking modes, and suggests that further work on semi-whispered speech is warranted. For consonants the results clearly indicate that: (1) Spectral properties of consonants are contingent upon the intended intonation. (2) While the differences between questions and answers are found in all three speech modes, some are more pronounced in whispered speech, and some appear only in whispered speech. (3) Even the second phoneme in a consonant cluster is sensitive to intonational changes, which is a previously unreported result. Several parameters displayed differences between questions and statements and seem to be robust as they are found in all three speech modes. A higher-frequency spectral peak and a higher COG were found in questions as opposed to statements. This latter finding is in line with results presented for German (Niebuhr, 2012; Ritter & Roettger, 2014) where higher COG values for voiceless fricatives were reported for questions in German modal speech and in accordance with the study by Heeren (2015b) where higher COG characterized /s/ and /f/ in higher pitch targets in whispered speech. Questions were produced with a lower spectral regression line slope m2 (from 3kHz to 11kHz) in comparison to statements indicating that the spectra fell more steeply above 3kHz for questions than for statements. In addition, questions were distinguished from answers by higher intensity, although the difference in consonantal intensity was smaller in semi-whisper than in the other modes. Apart from these robust differences, some parameters differentiate questions from answers exclusively in whispered speech. These include the spectral slope m1 (from 500Hz to 3kHz), being higher in questions than in statements indicating that questions are produced with steeper low-frequency slope. Furthermore, the two spectral moments skewness and kurtosis were found to be lower in whispered questions than in whispered statements. It is worth noting that the significantly higher skewness in whispered speech indicates that the mass of the spectral distribution is towards lower frequency values as compared to the other speech modes. However, for whispered questions, the mass of the spectral distribution moves towards higher frequencies as compared to whispered statements. In a similar vein, the higher kurtosis (peakedness; width of peak) in whispered speech indicates a narrower spectral peak for these sibilants in comparison to their semi-whispered and normal speech counterparts. The peak is, however, broader in whispered and semi-whispered questions than in whispered and semi-whispered statements. Finally, all segments in these long voiceless sequences, i.e., in the clusters, undergo changes in accordance with the pitch target. Our results indicate sensitivity to intonational differences not only in the fricatives directly adjacent to vowels but also the frication portions of affricates following voiceless fricatives and in absolute utterance-final position. Although the spectral properties of both fricatives and affricates are influenced by intended intonation, there are also differences between the segments independent of the pitch target: fricatives are produced with a higher m1 and lower m2 than affricates. Fricatives are also characterized by higher intensities, COG and STD than affricates, but lower skewness and kurtosis. The fact that the spectra of fricatives are different from those of affricates may be due to (i) the co-articulatory effects, i.e., the influence of a preceding vowel on fricatives, (ii) their position, i.e., the very final sentence position for affricates influenced by F0 declination and/or (iii) inherent differences between fricatives and affricates. 4 Discussion and conclusions The results indicate that varying intonation patterns affect not only vowels, as reported in much previous research, but consonants as well. Their spectral properties differ in line with the intended intonation of the speaker. Moreover, these spectral differences are more pronounced in whispered speech than in semi-whispered and normal speech. These results contribute to our understanding of different speaking modes and the encoding of intonational differences, and have several linguistic and non-linguistic applications. First of all, they provide further demonstration of an interdependent relationship between segments and intonation. Segmental properties are contingent upon intonation, independently of whether F0, the main correlate of intonation, is present or not and conversely segments, including voiceless sounds, show intonational differences. This conclusion has at least three important consequences for linguistically-oriented research. First, in general terms, intonation should not be viewed as a concept exclusively related to F0 but rather as an output of the interaction of multiple cues, including spectral properties of consonants. This conclusion supports Ladd’s (1996:6/2008:4) view according to which intonation refers to “suprasegmental phonetic features” including fundamental frequency, intensity and duration. Our study shows that intonation is also encoded in other measures such as spectral moments and such correlates can be found in consonants. This conclusion is also in line with recent studies on intonation, see e.g., recent studies in Żygis and Malisz (2016) where it has been shown that intonation does not only refer to F0 but it is an output of an interplay of several acoustic parameters. Second, voiceless segments, which have been generally avoided in research on intonation due to the F0 absence, should be considered as units which do encode information on intonation. Third, the results call into question the typical practice of disregarding intonational conditions in studies of segmental properties. The data indicate that intonation patterns significantly affect both vocalic and consonantal properties. This conclusion applies to all speech modes: whispered, semi-whispered and normal. Some of the spectral differences observed in consonants across conditions presumably arise from basic physiological processes. We focus here on the averaged spectra and the spectral slope measures (the double-peaked nature of these fricative spectra calls into question the use of the spectral moments analysis). For example, it is evident in the averaged spectra (Fig. 12) that the affricates have lower amplitudes than the fricatives. This may reflect the effects of decreasing subglottal pressure at utterance end. Lower driving pressures should yield reduced excitation of spectral poles, providing an explanation for flatter (less positive) m1 slope values in the affricates. Jesus and Shadle (2002) predicted that steeper m1 slopes should result from more posterior places of articulation, more localized sources, and higher source strengths. The higher m1 results in whispered questions compared to statements could therefore arise from any of those conditions (we note that a more posterior place of articulation would conflict with the vowel results, where higher F2s were observed). Conversely, lower m1 values in whisper compared to semi-whisper and modal speech could correspond to more anterior articulation, a more diffuse source (suggesting a difference in lingual configuration), and a lower source strength in this speech mode. Given that numerous articulatory characteristics can yield the same acoustic effect, articulatory data will be needed to distinguish among these possibilities. Whether the changes across speech modes are caused by internal or external factors, the end result is the same; the production system maintains its functions, i.e., to produce questions and statements, because the system of spoken language is robust (see e.g., Kingston & Diehl, 1995; Winter, 2014). Evidence for this property has been established, for example, by the wealth of experimental evidence derived from perturbation studies (see e.g., Brunner, Hoole, & Perrier, 2011; Weismer & Bunton, 1999) in which speakers, despite articulatory perturbations, found a way to achieve the desired output. The robustness of spoken language is possible due to a considerable repertoire of different and partially redundant cues which can enter into trading relations. Conversely, one cue can also serve different functions. For example, lower-frequency spectral peaks characterize whispered as compared to modal speech, and also differentiate questions vs. statements in whispered speech (see a discussion on various principles of robustness shared by speech and biological systems in Winter, 2014). The study also reports, to our knowledge for the first time, results on vowel and consonant characteristics in semi-whispered speech. The vowel intensity data (along with auditory impression) indicate that speakers produced this mode as expected in regard to the overall amplitude characteristics, in between the extremes of voiced and whispered speech. In other measures, however—most notably the formants—values for semi-whisper were not intermediate between those of the other two modes. Conceivably the lower F1s observed in semi-whisper compared to the other conditions reflect a strategy for producing softer speech by limiting articulatory opening. In contrast, the reversal of the formant differences between questions and statements, with lower values in questions than statements for F1 and F2 in semi-whisper, does not lend itself to simple interpretation. It is clear that more work is required to understand the nature of semi-whispered speech, but on the basis of the present data it appears that semi-whispered speech is not strictly identifiable in terms of presence vs. absence of particular cues but rather is characterized by an interplay of various cues, which may be subject to extensive inter-speaker variation. The distinct patterns of question-statement differences in semi-whispered speech observed here do suggest that this mode may provide useful material for testing interactions between speaking mode and intonation patterns, as well as cue weighting patterns in perception. We have presented a range of evidence indicating that various spectral cues encode prosodic differences, viz., rising intonation in questions and falling intonation in statements. The fact that some spectral differences between questions and statements are found exclusively, or to the greatest extent, in whispered speech emphasises the potential relevance of these cues for this particular speech mode and also suggests that they compensate for the lack of F0 which plays the most distinctive intonational role in the phonated speech mode. Such relations, in which one cue compensates for the absence or reduced occurrence of another cue, are widely known in the literature as trading relations (e.g., Diehl, 2011; Parker, Diehl, & Kluender, 1986). It is often the case that redundant cues enter into trading relationships wherein the magnitude of some cues is increased whereas others are decreased (see Pape & Jesus, 2014, 2015 for a discussion of the cue-trading aspect of the production-perception link). In the case at hand it is evident that some spectral cues are more pronounced in whispered speech than semi-whispered or voiced speech; the same cues may be less important or even redundant in voiced speech. The specific cues that are most important for robust perception of prosodic contrasts, and the degree to which such cues and cue-trading relationships are listener-dependent, remain to be determined by means of perception experiments. The study additionally may have implications for our understanding of speech adaptation processes. Previous studies have demonstrated that language users are able to quickly alter their output with the onset of environmental noise (e.g., Grynpas, Baker, & Hazan, 2011; see Winter & Christiansen, 2012 for an extensive discussion). The current results suggest that the feedback mechanism which detects changes in one’s perceived output and quickly adapts the speech production mechanism in order to achieve more intelligible speech is found in whispered speech as well. Our speakers varied the acoustic characteristics in accordance with which of the three speech modes they used. Thus, they did not adapt to external circumstances but to changes in their own speech patterns. In this context it would be interesting to see whether and how speech may differ in conditions where speakers talk to others, e.g., in dialogues (see a discussion of speech accommodation in terms of convergence and divergence in Winter & Christiansen, 2012). Finally, the results of the present study might be useful for speech synthesis where F0 reconstruction in whispered speech is a highly topical issue (e.g., McLoughlin, Sharifzadeh, Tan, Li, & Song, 2015; Sharifzadeh & McLoughlin, 2011; Toda, Nagiri, & Shikano, 2012). Several attempts to reconstruct F0 appear to have been insufficient because the algorithms were either based on small units (see e.g., MELP by Morris, 2003 or CELP by Sharifzadeh, 2010) or they were trying to derive F0 from vowel formants (McLoughlin et al., 2015). In our view, fine-grained spectral consonantal properties contingent upon intonational patterns, obtained by means of sensitive techniques, may provide additional parameters for reconstructing the intended intonation of a given sentence. Additional analyses of semi-whispered speech, in which F0 is partially present, could provide further insight into the variety of ways that prosodic variation might be synthesized.

Keywords Stuttering Attitudes Portugal POSHA–S Representative sampling 1 Introduction 1.1 Attitudes toward stuttering The current study was motivated by a growing number of investigations over several decades that have investigated public attitudes toward stuttering and have documented that the general public attributes negative traits to people who stutter (c.f. reviews by Hughes, 2015). Studies have sampled people from different ages (Doody, Kalinowski, Armson, & Stuart, 1993; Evans, Healey, Kawai, & Rowland, 2008; Griffin & Leahy, 2007; Hartford and Leahy, 2007; Kirsch, 2006), varying family status (Al-Khaledi, Lincoln, McCabe, Packman, & Alshatti, 2009; Crowe & Cooper, 1977; Özdemir, St. Louis, & Topbaş, 2011b), and different professional groups (Crowe & Cooper, 1983; Crowe & Walton, 1981; Dorsey & Guenther, 2000; Lass et al., 1992, 1994; Ruscello, Lass, Schmitt, & Pannbacker, 1994; Yeakle & Cooper, 1986), including speech and language therapists (SLTs) (Cooper & Cooper, 1996; Lass, Ruscello, Pannbacker, Schmitt, & Everly-Myers, 1989; Yairi & Williams, 1970). Findings from these studies indicate that anxiety, shyness, nervousness, introversion, and unassertiveness are among those negative traits commonly attributed to people who stutter and are referred to as the “stuttering stereotype” (MacKinnon, Hall, & MacIntyre, 2007; Yairi & Williams, 1970). The purpose of this study was to determine POSHA–S results using a probability sampling approach. As described in the Method (see Section 2.2), the country of Portugal was chosen for this research because the country's government is organized in such a way that a novel approach to probability sampling was feasible. Stigma, which can include prejudice (e.g., stuttering stereotype) and discrimination, relate to a “spoiled identity” (Goffman, 1963). Stigma typically begins with negative attitudes of the public (i.e., public stigma), but can become internalized by individuals (i.e., self-stigma) (Boyle, 2013). Given the pervasiveness of public and self-stigma related to stuttering, and their consequences, calls for actions, e.g., public awareness campaigns, to mitigate public stigma are common. The assumption has been that providing compelling, accurate, and up-to-date information regarding stuttering will increase the likelihood that people who stutter can grow up and live without the burden of stigma (Flynn & St. Louis, 2011). A major initiative, the International Project on Attitudes Toward Human Attributes (IPATHA), was inaugurated to compare public attitudes toward stuttering in different populations and then to develop a science of improving such attitudes. Both purposes required a standard survey instrument that could be translated and used internationally. Accordingly, the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes–Stuttering (POSHA–S explained in detail below in Section 2.1.1) was developed (St. Louis, 2011, 2012a, 2012b, 2015a, 2015b) and has been used since 2001 to collect information related to attitudes toward stuttering in 42 different countries and in 26 different languages (circa March, 2016). Excluding experimental versions of the instrument and samples composed entirely of stuttering individuals, SLTs, or Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) students, 11383 respondents from 141 different samples comprise the public database. The USA is most highly represented in the database, but American respondents account for 29% of the samples. Because the database samples vary, based on such selection variables as country, age, level of education, profession, socio-economic status (SES), or languages known, the median of the 141 sample means is taken as the “average” for each POSHA–S rating. The rationale is that, compared to the mean of all 141 sample means, the median value minimizes influence of “outlier” samples, i.e., samples with extremely positive (high) or extremely negative (low) attitudes. Currently, the median of the “Overall Stuttering Score” (OSS, described below) is 17 for public samples. On the POSHA–S −100 to +100 scale, this means that values below 17 are below average and those above 17 are above average. Most of the studies have employed various methods of convenience sampling. Typically, these involved investigators asking friends, acquaintances, family members, students, or colleagues to both fill out the POSHA–S and to distribute other questionnaires to their friends, acquaintances, family members, students, or colleagues. Many of these studies have excluded SLTs or SLT students (except those seeking to sample only these populations) since clear evidence exists that their attitudes are more positive than those of people in other professions (e.g., St. Louis, Przepiórka, et al., 2014). A few studies have used a form of probability sampling. These range from random sampling from a list of the population to sampling from a randomly selected cluster of potential respondents. 1.2 Stuttering attitudes in various countries Whereas, studies of public attitudes toward stuttering have been carried out in numerous countries, no systematic research has been reported that has sought to collect a representative sample that would allow generalization of findings to an entire country. Following is a review of selected studies that measured attitudes in samples across different regions of a country or sampled comprehensively enough to generate an impression of attitudes in a specific country. Most of the studies used convenience sampling. The few that used probability sampling are highlighted. 1.2.1 Comparative country studies with a short questionnaire Van Borsel and colleagues (Pereira, Rossi, & Borsel, 2008; Van Borsel, Verniers, & Bouvry, 1999; Xing Ming, Jing, Yi Wen, & Van Borsel, 2001) carried out parallel studies in Belgium, China, and Brazil with an orally-presented questionnaire composed of 12 questions (different from the POSHA–S questionnaire). The three studies were similar enough such that the authors have reported inter-country comparisons. Questions related to respondents’ knowledge about stuttering as well as thoughts about stuttering in other races and treatment of stuttering children. The studies were carried out with a form of convenience sampling, but with constraints designed to reduce bias that may be inherent in typical samples of convenience. Eligible respondents were people on a main shopping street who happened to be present on the days of sampling and agreed to talk to examiners who approached them. The fact that none of the respondents were presumably known to the questioners reduced selection bias, and the fact that none of them could have known in advance that they would be approached reduced response bias. Care was taken to assure that three age groupings and both sexes were proportionally included and that SLTs, physicians, and people who stuttered were excluded. Similarities and differences among respondents from Belgium, China, and Brazil were reported. For example, 68–85% reported that they had heard or met a person who stutters, and of those 41–59% knew someone who stuttered who was a friend, relative, or neighbor. Fifty-three to 71% thought more males than females stuttered. Other selected results of these studies are compared to those of the current study in Section 4.3. 1.2.2 Comparative studies using the POSHA–S Although numerous studies have been carried out in the USA using the POSHA–S in its original English, only one study intended to sample a subset of the population of the entire country, i.e., a study of American Indians (Native Americans) (Beste-Guldborg, St. Louis, & Campanale, 2015). In this study, through email lists acquired from tribal directories provided by tribal leaders, more than 1500 self-identified American Indian adults filled out online POSHA–S. They represented four regional tribal groups: Northern Plains, Eastern, Southwestern, and Northwestern tribal groups. Overall, 95 different tribal affiliations were listed, with individuals responding from 35 of the 50 USA states. Summary POSHA–S scores (described below) were very similar across the four regions and the Overall Stuttering Scores (OSSs) were identical to the POSHA–S database median (17) in the majority of the sample. Nevertheless, significant differences between regions for selected individual items occurred, partly because of the large sample sizes (n =205–639). The authors concluded that, in spite of a few exceptions, the American Indians had accommodated closely to majority attitudes around the country. Using Turkish translations of the POSHA–S, public attitudes in Turkey were investigated in four different studies. Three of them were convenience samples (i.e., Aydın, 2008; Çoşkun, 2006; St. Louis, de Andrade, Georgieva, & Troudt, 2005,). One was a probability sample derived from a public school-based scheme wherein city districts, then elementary schools within them, were selected at random (i.e., Özdemir et al., 2011b). This probability study compared samples of sixth-year elementary students with their parents, grandparents or adult relatives, and adult neighbors. Specific results are summarized in Section 4.3. Overall, however, the above-mentioned convenience samples yielded more negative Beliefs about stuttering on the POSHA–S but less negative Self Reactions to stuttering [Section 2.1.1] than the probability samples. Accordingly, Özdemir, St. Louis, and Topbaş (2011a) concluded that results from convenience sampling generated different attitudes than results obtained from probability sampling in one Turkish city. Four POSHA–S investigations in Poland (in Polish) explored attitudes toward people who stutter (Przepiórka, Błachnio, St. Louis, & Woźniak, 2013; St. Louis, Przepiórka, et al., 2014; Węsierska, Węsierska, St. Louis, & Beste-Guldborg, 2015; Węsierska & St. Louis, 2014). Respondents were 268 adults from the general public, 188 SLTs, 403 SLT students and 205 university students from other majors, all responding via convenience sampling. Generally, the Polish attitudes on different samples were quite consistent except that, uniformly, SLTs held more positive attitudes on POSHA–S than SLT students, and both groups were more positive than the general public (St. Louis, Przepiórka, et al., 2014; Węsierska, Błachnio, Przepiórka, & St. Louis, 2015). Subsequent to data collection in the current study but highly relevant to it, St. Louis, Sønsterud, et al. (2016) reported a study of European country attitudes that involved combining data from eight different studies of public attitudes. It showed that attitudes varied across countries, with the most positive attitudes being demonstrated in a combined sample from Norway and Sweden with an OSS of 34 (Nillson & Wetterling, 2013; St. Louis, Sønsterud, Carlo, Heitmann, & Kvenseth, 2014), followed next by the same OSS (23) from a sample from Bosnia-Herzegovina and a combined sample from Ireland and England (Daly & Leahy, 2014; Tyrrell, 2009; Węsierska & St. Louis, 2014), then by a sample from Germany (OSS =15) (Theiling, 2013), and finally with the least positive attitudes from Italy (OSS =−3) (Tomaiuloi, Del Gado, Capparelli, & St. Louis, 2013). It was noteworthy that for three of the country samples, i.e., Norway, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Italy, three different regions of the countries had been sampled in the same investigations, permitting regional comparisons within the countries. In each case, differences within countries were small, even though differences among countries were large. In the case of Italy, for example, 100 adults were sampled from several provinces in the north, in the central region, and in the south, wherein OSSs were 0, 12, and −6, respectively. All of these studies used convenience sampling except a portion of the Swedish sample which employed probability sampling. In searching for predictors in this compilation of studies of European attitudes, the authors were limited by the differences in sampling procedure (e.g., different strategies for convenience sampling), sample size, and other factors. Accordingly, they used a strategy of comparing rank orders of numerous demographic variables in the five countries (or areas) with rank orders for OSS. This procedure would not identify the effect of a given variable, e.g., sex of the respondent, on all the attitudes. Instead, it would provide an estimate of whether that variable had parallel or nonparallel effects in the different countries or areas. It is noteworthy that the suspected demographic variables of sex, age, and education had less effect on public stuttering attitudes than one's citizenship. Thus, national identity, or unique factors related to being a citizen of a particular country, was hypothesized to be a variable worthy of further investigation. For example, it might seem that the most negative Italian attitudes might somehow be related to less positive attitudes that have been observed in southern Europe and Turkey, but the samples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where more positive OSSs were observed, were roughly in the same latitude. Furthermore, recent unpublished POSHA–S data from France and Spain generated OSSs closer to or above the overall POSHA–S database mean, 19 and 16, respectively (M. Eboli, personal communication, April, 2014; L. Leprovost, personal communication November, 2015). The authors called for additional studies of public attitudes in Europe, especially those that could be generalized with some confidence to entire countries. Given that no systematic studies of public attitudes toward stuttering in any country using the POSHA–S have been published, the current study focused on Portugal and its potential geographical and cultural influences that might affect Portuguese public attitudes. Would Portuguese attitudes be more negative than the POSHA–S median values, as was the case in Italy, or be close to the median, as was the case in France and Spain (with which Portugal shares a border)? Regardless of the answers to this question, the need exists for a study designed to sample public attitudes toward stuttering in such a way that would enable statistical inferences from the sample to the typical, literate, adult population of an entire country. To do so, the sample size would need to be large enough to provide the statistical power to identify potential demographic variables that influence public attitudes within the country. A systematic, country-wide sample of public attitudes toward stuttering in Portugal would also be useful for stakeholders in the country. Although no systematic research study has been conducted related to public attitudes toward those who stutter, information distributed through pamphlets by the Portuguese Stuttering Association indicate that the public holds the stuttering stereotype with misconceptions about stuttering as well as a lack of information about the disorder (Associação Portuguesa de Gagos [Portugese Stuttering Association], 2014). Results from a carefully designed, probability sampling study could inform future public awareness campaigns or cognitive-behavioral treatments to attempt to mitigate negative stuttering attitudes and also serve as a baseline against which potential long-term attitude changes could be compared. 1.3 Purpose The overall purpose of this study was to measure the attitudes related to stuttering and people who stutter throughout the country of Portugal using the widely used POSHA–S. Two research questions guided the research. (a) To what extent is a local administration office-based probability sampling scheme in all the regions of the country of Portugal feasible for measuring and generalizing public attitudes toward stuttering? Addressing this question involved comparing demographic profiles to Portuguese census information and comparing the attitude results with results from other samples around the world. In that this is the first countrywide probability sample of public attitudes toward stuttering, complete information on the results are provided in tables and supplementary material. (b) To what extent do selected demographic variables predict Portuguese stuttering attitudes? Results were stratified according to selected variables, such as educational achievement, and tested statistically to determine whether the variables predicted more positive versus less positive stuttering attitudes. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Attitude measure 2.1.1 Instrument The POSHA–S is an epidemiological survey instrument designed to measure public attitudes toward stuttering worldwide (St. Louis, 2011, 2012b, 2015a, 2015b). As such, it was deemed the most appropriate measure of public attitudes for this feasibility study. It has a demographic section, a general section related to the comparison of stuttering with other stigmatizing and nonstigmatizing (“anchor”) conditions, and a detailed section related to stuttering. Items ratings of the POSHA–S are clustered and averaged to calculate components and components are clustered and averaged into subscores. The Beliefs about people who stutter subscore reflects opinions external to the respondent, i.e., Traits/Personality, Help From, Cause, and Potential. The Self Reactions to people who stutter subscore reflects opinions that personally involve or are internal to the respondents, i.e., Accommodating/Helping, Social Distance/Sympathy, Knowledge/Experience, and Knowledge Source. The mean of these two stuttering subscores is the OSS. The third subscore, Obesity/Mental Illness, permits comparisons of attitudes toward stuttering with those other potentially stigmatizing attributes (See St. Louis [2011] for a detailed rationale.) 2.1.2 Scoring Items in the general section and some of the demographic section require a 1–5 rating. Items in the detailed stuttering section require a “yes”, “no”, “not sure” response. The latter are first converted to a 1–3 scale (i.e., “no”=1, “not sure”=2 and “yes”=3) and then, for the sake of convenience, to a −100 to +100 scale with 0 being neutral. The 1–5 ratings are also converted to the −100 to +100 scale (i.e., “1”=−100, “2”=−50, “3”=0, “4”=+50 and “5”=+100) (St. Louis, 2012b)). Ratings on some items are inverted so that, uniformly, higher POSHA–S scores reflect more sensitive or accurate attitudes (consistent with recent literature findings), and lower scores reflect less sensitive or accurate attitudes. 2.1.3 Psychometric properties Psychometric and related properties of the POSHA–S have been carefully addressed and shown in numerous publications to be satisfactory and adequate, i.e., item analysis (St. Louis, 2012b), reliability (St. Louis, 2012b; Junuzović-Žunić et al., 2015; St. Louis, Lubker, Yaruss, & Aliveto, 2009), construct and discriminant validity (Flynn & St. Louis, 2011; St. Louis, Reichel, Yaruss, & Lubker, 2009; St. Louis, Williams, Ware, Guendouzi, & Reichel, 2014), and internal consistency (Al-Khaledi et al., 2009; St. Louis, 2012b). The instrument has been shown to be user-friendly as well as easy to measure and score (St. Louis, Lukber, Yaruss, Adkins, & Pill, 2008; St. Louis, Reichel, et al., 2009). It has been typically administered as a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, but an online administration versus paper-and-pencil administration were found to generate very similar results (St. Louis, 2012c). 2.1.4 Translation In a growing number of studies, the POSHA–S has been administered in many different languages (26 languages circa March, 2016), documenting that the instrument can be successfully and efficiently translated to other languages for international comparisons (St. Louis, 2015a, 2015b). For example, in the most comprehensive translation study, St. Louis and Roberts (2010) showed that differences in stuttering attitudes in two officially bilingual countries (Canada and Cameroon), were large regardless of whether an experimental prototype of the POSHA–S was given in English or French (when respondents selected their stronger language for the survey). By contrast, differences between English and French POSHA–S were small, regardless of the country. The authors recommended that POSHA–S translations be carried out by a bilingual person (in English and the other language) with knowledge of speech and language therapy. A back-translation to English should also be made by another bilingual person without familiarity with POSHA–S or the details of the study in question. They also pointed out that back-translations could not always exclude differences between the original and the translation. In order to rule out inaccuracies or inconsistencies that might affect the results, translation procedures carried out for the current study were more stringent than those of any previous translations (St. Louis, 2015a, 2015b). The following procedures were carried out: Translation into European Portuguese, synthesis of the translations, back-translation, committee review of the resultant translation, and feedback from the committee for final adjustments (Beaton, Bombardier, Guillemin, & Ferraz, 1998; Guillemin, Bombardier, & Beaton, 1993). The detailed process and satisfactory results are described elsewhere (Valente, Jesus, Roberto, Leahy, & St. Louis, 2015). 2.2 Probability sampling scheme A three-stage cluster probability sampling scheme, approved by an ethical committee and the National Data Protection Commission, was implemented for this study, with each stage including simple random sampling (Thompson, 2012). The scheme was designed to locate adults representing the population of Portugal as accurately as possible. The first stage entailed compiling a list of all Portuguese mainland districts and Islands (a total of 20 districts) as well as a list of all administrative regions (concelhos) within them. All 308 administrative regions in the entire country were included, with a number assigned to each region. Using random sampling without replacement five administrative regions within each district were selected such that a total of 100 administrative regions were included in the sampling frame. For the second stage, a list of all administrative subregions (freguesias) within each of the five administrative regions selected from each district was compiled resulting in a total of 1456 administrative subregions. Again, random sampling without replacement was used to choose one administrative subregion within each administrative region already chosen, yielding a total of 100 administrative subregions. The local administrative office (Junta de Freguesia) of each administrative subregion was the site where potential respondents would be selected because these local offices are accessible and used by the local population in Portugal for a wide variety of public services that are necessary and frequently used by adults, all in one place. Specifically, the local administrative office is the place where such activities as obtaining internet access, licenses (e.g., for animals or hunting), photocopy authentication, legal advice, social support services, tutoring (academic support), support for being unemployed, and – in some local offices – postal services are available. It is also the place where people attend various citizen meetings or workshops organized by the offices, register to vote, and cast ballots in elections. As such, a wide range of the population in terms of age, sex, occupation, education, income level, and health status would regularly go into the offices. The third of the three-stage cluster probability sampling scheme comprised the actual respondent identification and questionnaire distribution. Staff at each local administrative office (representing each of the 100 administrative subregions) selected one male and one female within each of three age groups: 18–24 yr, 25–64 yr, and 65 yr or older to be included as potential respondents. In summary, the random sampling procedure would represent 100 administrative subregions (taken from five administrative regions, one from each of 20 districts) and would yield 600 potential respondents (300 males and 300 females). One third of the males and females would be in each of the three age ranges. The first author made a list of the local administrative offices in each of the 100 administrative regions through a web search and then contacted those that were selected randomly in the second stage. The first contact, carried out via telephone and/or email explained the purposes of the study, explained the random procedure to select suitable persons to fill out the POSHA–S questionnaires, and asked permission to distribute questionnaires. When a contact person of the local office declined to assist in the study, the first author contacted the next local office of the same administrative subregion and followed the same procedure. Of the 100 local administrative offices contacted, the initial compliance rate was 70/100 or 70%. Proceeding to the next local administrative office after one declined generated a compliance rate of 100%. The contact person, typically a staff employee, at each local office actually made the final selection of respondents (a male and female in each of three age groups). It was requested that the staff person ask the first six persons entering the office to complete the questionnaire who would complete the inclusion criteria, i.e., that they lived in the subregion, that they were able to read and write, and that they were male or female in one of the age ranges. For statistical analysis, the administrative regions randomly chosen were clustered using the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS level II, hereinafter referred to as “Region”), which is a hierarchical system that divides the country based on existing administrative units and population size (EUROSTAT, 2011). The 100 administrative regions were distributed through seven NUTS level II regions, that is, five divisions on Portugal's mainland (North, Central, Lisbon, Alentejo, and Algarve) and two island regions (Madeira and Azores), as shown in Fig. 1 . The region percentages of the NUTS II data are also represented in Fig.1. 2.3 Data analysis The first purpose of the study was to ascertain the feasibility of the probability sampling countrywide. This was carried out in two ways. First, we compared selected POSHA–S demographic results with available Portuguese census data. The extent to which the probability sampling scheme generated results that approximated the census data would be an index of the extent the survey results were representative of Portugal's population. Second, we compared the results of the Portuguese stuttering attitudes with those from around the world generated from the POSHA–S. Specifically, we compared mean ratings for each POSHA–S component, subscore, and the OSS with the lowest, highest, and median sample mean values of the POSHA–S database, which contained 141 samples representing 11383 public respondents from 42 countries and 26 languages (circa March, 2016). Percentile ranks of the mean ratings for POSHA–S items, components, subscores and OSS for the Portuguese sample derived from all 141 database samples were calculated. The percentage of ratings falling in the 1st quartile (0–25th percentiles), interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles) and the 4th quartile (75th–100th percentiles) were used to determine if the attitudes of the Portuguese sample were close to the median or more/less positive than those in the POSHA–S total sample. It must be recalled that “average” adult attitudes toward stuttering are characterized by stereotype and stigma, and more similarities than differences have characterized POSHA–S samples around the world (St. Louis, 2015a, 2015b). Accordingly, another way of conceptualizing the percentile comparisons is that, within the POSHA–S ratings of the numerous populations sampled, some items typically reflect accurate or empathic attitudes while others do not. Thus, actual mean ratings must be interpreted within the context of percentiles relative to all the samples that have been analyzed rather than relative to their absolute −100 to +100 values. For the second purpose, predicting POSHA–S summary ratings (stuttering subscores and the OSS), eight demographic variables were targeted for their predictive potential for stuttering attitudes: Age group, regions in country, completed school levels, working situation, sex, marital status, parenthood, and number of languages known. As a first step, eight multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedures were run in IBM SPSS Statistics 22.00 to assess the overall influence of each of these predictive variables on the Beliefs subscore, the Self Reactions subscore, and the OSS with a Bonferroni correction such that alpha level for significance was set at p ≤0.00625 (.05/8). Roy's largest root was chosen as the discriminant function variate because this statistic typically generates the most powerful results on MANOVA comparisons (Field, 2013). The second step involved identifying the predictor variables that revealed statistically significant impact using univariate ANOVAs for their influence on the stuttering subscores and the OSS. Again, a Bonferroni correction was implemented, resulting in a criterion for significance of p ≤0.0168 (.05/3). As a third and final step, Gabriel post-hoc pairwise comparisons were run between means in all variables for which the ANOVAs were significant. Gabriel post-hoc tests were chosen since they can accommodate differences in sample sizes (Field, 2013). 3 Results 3.1 Demographic 3.1.1 Respondents From a total of 600 persons given a POSHA–S through the three-stage sampling procedure described above, a total of 311 questionnaires were returned, generating a return rate of 52%. Babbie (2006) asserts that a response rate of at least 50% is considered acceptable for analysis in a social science research survey. Table 1 presents absolute and relative frequencies of demographic information for the respondents according to demographic categories. Eight of these were evaluated as predictor variables (see below). Data related to respondents’ acquaintance with or self-identification as stuttering – as well as the four other anchor attributes on the POSHA–S (obesity, mental illness, left handedness, and intelligence) – are also listed. Wherever available, information from the 2011 Portuguese census (INE, 2011) is shown for the sake of comparing the probability sample obtained for this study to the entire population. Nine out of 10 respondents were from Portugal's mainland, and 3 out of 10 were from the center of the country. Nearly 40% of the Portuguese respondents who completed questionnaires were in the middle 25–64 age group, with approximately 30% in either the younger or older age groups. Respondents were about evenly split female to male, i.e., 51–48%. For educational achievement, the largest subgroup of respondents had completed high school (nearly 30%). Similarly, for current work status, the largest subgroup (45%) was currently working. Sixty percent of the sample was married, slightly over half had children, and about 45% knew only one language, i.e., European Portuguese. It can be seen that for sex, school level completed, working status, and marital status, census data indicate that the Portuguese sample is generally aligned with the population of the country (INE, 2011). By virtue of the individuals who visited the administrative offices, the younger, 18–24 group was over-represented, the middle, 25–64 group was under-represented, and the older, 65+ group was slightly over-represented. Also, the Center and Alentejo regions were over-represented while the North and Lisbon region were under-represented. More than half (55%) of the respondents reported having an acquaintance who stuttered. Only five people (less than 2%) identified themselves as individuals who stutter (which did not disqualify him/her as a respondent), and fewer than 1% as mentally ill. One quarter reported not knowing anyone who stuttered. More than one-third (36%) of the respondents reported knowing no one who was mentally ill, which represented the least familiarity with the five attributes. Only 1 in 6 of the Portuguese respondents regarded themselves as being intelligent. 3.1.2 Demographic and related ratings POSHA–S results for demographic ratings (converted to the −100 to +100 scale) relating to respondents’ relative income, self-rating of health and abilities, life priorities, and completion time are presented in Supplementary Dataset 1. The table also includes ratings for the two attributes not included in POSHA–S summary scores, i.e., left handedness and intelligence, and thus are treated as demographic variables. In this table, means (converted to the −100 to +100 scale) are followed by the POSHA–S database medians (based on 141 samples around the world), and the rank-order or percentile of the Portuguese data relative to those 141 samples. Relative income was scored well below average of the POSHA–S total database samples, i.e., −22 versus 0 on the −100 to +100 scale or at the 6th percentile. Self-ratings of health and abilities were also rated much lower than the average sample in the database, with percentiles ranging from the lowest observed heretofore for physical health (0 percentile) to ability to speak (13th percentile). Hypotheses related to why these values were rated so low are discussed in Section 4. Except for spending time alone, ratings of life priorities were within the approximate average interquartile range (25th–75th percentile) relative to the 141 samples in the database. 3.2 Comparison of the Portuguese results with POSHA–S database POSHA–S studies have typically been summarized in radial graphs that include components and subscores, with more positive scores closer to the periphery and more negative ratings closer to its center (St. Louis, 2011, 2012a, 2012b, 2015a, 2015b). The Overall Stuttering Score (OSS) of the Portuguese sample was 19 or only two units higher than the database average. Compared to all the samples in the database, this was at the 65th percentile relative to 141 previously analyzed samples from 42 countries, or slightly above the median at the 50th percentile. Component and subscore ratings are compared to the lowest, highest and median sample means from the POSHA–S database. The Portuguese comparisons can be seen clearly in Fig. 2 where mean values parallel the median database value quite closely but reflect more positive attitudes for the Potential and Social Distance/Sympathy components (which were in the 4th quartile) and less positive than average attitudes for the Help From component (which falls into the 1st quartile). Portuguese respondents also indicated knowing considerably less than the median database value for the combined Amount Known about obesity and mental illness (1st quartile). Overall, however, Fig. 2 shows graphically that the Portuguese respondents, chosen according to a careful probability sampling procedure, generated mean stuttering attitudes ratings that were similar to the medians from the POSHA–S database. Supplementary Dataset 2 provides all of the mean ratings of the Portuguese sample scored in the POSHA–S (items, components, subscores, and the OSS), along with the median database values and percentiles. It is important to recall that the percentiles compare the Portuguese to all other samples; they do not address the absolute positivity or negativity of particular attitudes (see Section 3.3). In comparison to previously analyzed samples, the 60 sample ratings are distributed as follows: 1st quartile or least positive attitudes, 7%; interquartile range or average attitudes, 73%; and 4th quartile of most positive attitudes, 20%. The mean percentile value was 54. Taken together, the Portuguese attitudes obtained through the probability sampling procedure in this study were mostly average but with a trend for slightly more positive than average ratings. Selected items that reflected more positive than average attitudes (i.e., in the 4th quartile) were: Agreeing that people who stutter can hold any job they want, rejecting that they should hide their stuttering; not feeling impatient while a conversational partner is stuttering; not being concerned if their doctor, a sibling, or the respondents themselves stuttered; wanting to stutter themselves. More negative than average attitudes (i.e., in the 1st quartile) were reported for three items: Accepting that a medical doctor should help a person who stutters and rejecting that others who stutter should do so and not agreeing that stuttering is caused by genetic inheritance. 3.3 POSHA–S predictors variables of Portuguese stuttering attitudes The predictor demographic variables were analyzed with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for the Beliefs and Self Reactions subscores and the OSS. Table 2 shows values for Beliefs, Self Reactions, and OSSs of the POSHA–S for subcategories in each of the eight predictor variables and Supplementary Dataset 3 provides detailed statistical results for each variable. The highest or most positive mean values were observed for the 25–64 age group (23), males, respondents living in Azores, those with 4-yr university degrees, students, unmarried respondents, non-parents, and persons knowing three languages. Results of MANOVA and univariate ANOVA analyses for each of the eight predictor variables revealed that five variables were statistically significant for OSSs: age (F(2,299)=13.853, p =0.004), region (F(6, 298)=2.580, p =0.019), school level completed (F(6, 290)=3.258, p =0.004), working situation (F(4, 301)=4.783, p =0.001), and number of languages known (F(3, 302)=4.055, p =0.008). Three variables did generate significant effects: Sex, marital status, and parental status. Considering the Self Reactions subscore, age, region, school level completed, working situation, and number of languages were significantly different. Only the age group variable significantly influenced the Beliefs subscore. Gabriel post-hoc multiple comparisons revealed significant differences between the 18–24 and ≥65 age groups (M =14.966, p <0.001) and also between the 25–64 and ≥65 age groups (M =14.831, p <0.001) for Self-Reactions. For Beliefs, the 25–64 age group held significantly more positive attitudes than the ≥65 group (M =8.068, p =0.014). And for OSS, the 18–24 and 25–64 age groups differed significantly from the older age group (M =11.065, p <0.001, and M =11.450, p <0.001, respectively). Post-hoc comparisons for the region variable revealed that respondents from the Azores island region held more positive Self Reactions in comparison with Central region (M =21.58, p =0.046), Lisbon (M =30.46, p =0.004), Alentejo (M =26.16, p =0.008), and Algarve (M =33.45, p =0.011). Self-Reactions of respondents who completed secondary school or a 4-yr university degree were also more positive than those with only a primary school education (M =−14.245, p =0.006 and M =−15.493, p =0.041, respectively). The same was true for the OSS comparisons (M =−9.765, p =0.010 and M =−13. 222, p =0.005, respectively). Working people held significantly higher Self Reactions subscores and OSS values when compared with retired people (M =15.640, p =0.000 and M =9.380, p =0.001, respectively). Students and unemployed people also had higher OSSs than retired people did (M =9.671, p =0.048 and M =10.267, p =0.016, respectively). We carried out additional ANOVAs to identify factors that might explain the lower scores of elderly people. The amount known about stuttering reported by the ≥65-yr age group was lower (although not significantly so) than the amount known by the younger age groups. Nevertheless, Post-hoc comparisons within the ≥65 age group revealed that the amount known influenced negatively the Self Reactions subscore [F(4, 84)=3.865, p =0.006]. Accordingly, we submit that misinformation or lack of information can be a reason for significantly negative ratings of older adults compared with younger adults. Post-hoc comparisons for the number of languages known was associated with significantly more positive attitudes for respondents who spoke three languages versus one language (M =−15.96, p <0.001) and also between two languages and three languages spoken (M =−13.30, p =0.017) for the Self Reactions subscore. OSSs were significantly higher for people who knew three languages in comparison with people knew only one language (M =−8.23, p =0.024). 4 Discussion 4.1 Summary The present study analyzed the public attitudes of the Portuguese population toward people who stutter through a representative sample of the entire country based on a Portuguese translation of the POSHA–S. Mean attitudes on the POSHA–S using a three-stage cluster sampling procedure, with final recruitment of respondents accomplished by staff at widely-used local administrative offices were commensurate with median of the 141 previously analyzed samples from 42 countries around the world. To the extent that the median represents “average” adult stuttering attitudes, the results of this country-wide sampling procedure were approximately “average,” with trends toward slightly “more positive than average” attitudes. With the methodological innovations employed, we submit that the detailed probability sampling not only generated a representative sample from which to generalize about Portugal's adult stuttering attitudes but also a solid baseline against which future samples can be compared. Given the careful stratification of the sample, the variables that predicted more positive versus less positive stuttering attitudes can be regarded as important for future investigations. Respondents’ age, home region, educational achievement, employment/student status, and number of languages known all were significant predictors. By contrast, respondents’ sex, marital status, or parental status were not significant predictors of stuttering attitudes. 4.2 Portuguese attitudes toward stuttering Fig. 2 confirms that the measured attitudes toward stuttering of the Portuguese population were visibly very similar to the median tracing of all the sample means in the POSHA–S database. Their Beliefs about stuttering were 34, their Self Reactions, 5, and their OSS, 19. Their Obesity/Mental Illness ratings were −34. As noted, these ratings were average to slightly more positive than average. Consistent with the database sample ratings, fully 73% of the percentiles shown in Supplementary Dataset 2 for each Portuguese POSHA–S rating are in the interquartile range, with 7% and 20%, respectively, in the 1st and 4th quartiles. 4.3 Feasibility of the probability sampling scheme The over-arching purpose of this study was to carry out a study of public attitudes toward stuttering that would be representative of the entire country of Portugal. Specifically, one goal was to determine the feasibility of using a local administrative office-based method of respondent recruitment in the country-wide probability sample. Results indicated that the sampling procedure, in general, generated respondents who were representative of the Portuguese population. With a few exceptions, the samples obtained at the 100 local administrative offices were aligned to the expected percentages based on data from the official Portuguese census. Most notably, the sample was almost equally balanced for males and females and was parallel to the population percentages for school achievement, work status, and marital status. Additionally, the fact that 2% of the respondents stuttered is close to prevalence rates of stuttering around the world (Bloodstein & Ratner, 2008). The relative income rating (combined from ratings of one's income relative to both friends and family as well as all the people in one's country) of −22 was considerably lower than the POSHA–S database median of 0 on the −100 to +100 scale, placing it at the 6th percentile. This was also lower than all five countries/areas in the St. Louis, Sønsterud, et al. (2016) study, where mean ratings ranged from −9 in Bosnia & Herzegovina to 15 in Germany. These means, as are most in the POSHA–S database, were generated from convenience sampling. Özdemir et al. (2011a) found that the relative incomes of two probability samples of adults in Turkey were also much lower than those of adults from a convenience sample in the same city, i.e., −7 and −12 versus 9. It is likely that most previous POSHA–S investigators, representing moderate income levels, tend to recruit respondents more similar to their own incomes than do probability sampling strategies. Although not comparable to any available census data, it was puzzling that the Portuguese sample regarded themselves much lower than average on the demographic self-ratings for physical health, mental health, ability to learn, and ability to speak (0–13th percentiles relative to the POSHA–S database samples) (Supplementary Dataset 1). Moreover, only 16% regarded themselves as intelligent (18th percentile). These are commensurate with some other cultural samples analyzed wherein respondents apparently do no not wish to “brag” about themselves, e.g., Poland (Przepiórka et al., 2013) and Hong Kong or Mainland China (Ip, St. Louis, Myers, & An Xue, 2012) where rank orders were all in the 1st quartile relative to the database and most below the 10th percentile. Apparently, the Portuguese population is not predisposed to rate themselves highly on characteristics that might appear to be “bragging.” Public attitudes toward stuttering in Portugal, in comparison to other database samples around the world that used the POSHA–S, were also roughly “average.” Importantly, however, in comparison to the most relevant study of European attitudes (St. Louis, Sønsterud, et al., 2016), Portuguese attitudes were substantially more positive than measured attitudes in Italy (OSS =−3), slightly more positive than those in Germany (OSS =15), slightly lower than Bosnia & Herzegovina or the combined English/Irish samples (OSS =23), and substantially lower than the combined Norway/Sweden samples (OSS =34). Additionally, the present probability sample also confirmed that regions within the Portugal mainland held similar attitudes, confirming what has been showed in three different regions of Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, and Norway (St. Louis, Sønsterud, et al., 2016). The authors of the European study acknowledged that variation in sampling schemes may have influenced their results; however, it is extremely unlikely that the large differences (i.e., between the Scandinavian countries and Italy) were due to sampling differences. Given that demographic variables such as sex, age, SES did not predict the rank orders of ratings among the five countries or areas, national identity was suggested as a likely predictor variable. The authors did not speculate on how national identity might affect attitudes, i.e., why the Italian attitudes were substantially less positive than the other four countries and why the Scandinavian attitudes were substantially more positive. The current study does not address the question either; yet, it further brings into focus the need to include a measure of national identity (e.g., the International Social Survey [Rusciano, 2003]) in public attitude studies in different countries or perhaps measures of identity within countries. Comparing to other samples within countries, Portuguese attitudes were similar to the four tribal groups of American Indians (Beste-Guldborg et al., 2015 wherein OSSs ranged from 17 to 24. They were also similar to attitudes of adults sampled in six different regions of Poland (OSS =18) (Przepiórka et al., 2013). As noted, most studies utilizing the POSHA–S have employed convenience sampling methodology. Only one study in Turkey compared probability sampling of adults using a public school-based cluster sampling scheme with a previous study using convenience sampling in Eskişehir, Turkey (Özdemir et al., 2011a, 2011b). Whereas OSSs were similar, the profiles of the various components and subscores were markedly different using the different sampling methods, leading the authors to conclude that probability sampling was the preferred procedure. Comparing the Portuguese results to adults in the two different probability samples (Özdemir et al., 2011b), summary stuttering attitudes for Portugal (OSS =19) were more positive than those for Turkey (OSS =−2 and OSS =4). Of course, the Turkish studies were not attempting to generalize to an entire country, but demographic difference were likely important determinants for the differences observed from the current study. School-based samples are likely effective and efficient strategies to generate probability samples in specified areas, but country differences in public versus private schools, socio-economic influences on school populations, sizes and grade level included in school, and other factors such as access to schools in an increasingly dangerous world limit their use. By contrast, the current study confirms that in countries such as Portugal where adults are obliged to visit various local governmental offices for a wide variety of necessary life functions, a local administrative office-based sampling model provides an attractive, relatively inexpensive strategy to carry out probability sampling of adults in an entire country where these or similar government offices exist. The results of this study can be compared to results of three items of the Van Borsel et al. (1999), Pereira et al. (2008), and Xing Ming et al. (2001) studies in Belgium, Brazil, and China related to knowing a person who stutter and the cause of stuttering. Compared to 82% of the Flemish respondents, 85% of the Chinese respondents, and 68% of the Brazilian respondents who had heard of or met a person who stutters, 79% of the Portuguese respondents identified an acquaintance, close friend, relative, or someone else who stuttered. Nearly half (45%) of the Flemish respondents believed the cause of stuttering to be psychogenic, compared to 57% of the Brazilians but only 15% of the Chinese. Forty-four percent of the Portuguese respondents marked “yes” that stuttering was caused by a very frightening event. By contrast, for genetic etiology, 70% of the Belgium respondents, 69% of the Brazilian respondents, and 77% of the Chinese respondents thought that stuttering was not hereditary. This corresponds to a “no” answer to the question for 63% of the Portuguese respondents. The results suggest that the Portugal local office-based sampling procedure yielded reasonably similar results to the face-to-face interviews on the street in three cities in other countries. Taken together, the comparisons of the current respondents with Portuguese census data and the comparison of Portuguese attitudes with other studies of stuttering attitudes around the world indicate that the administrative office-based sampling scheme is an effective way to sample attitudes in an entire country. As such, the POSHA–S results for Portugal can be considered to be the most representative profile of public attitudes toward stuttering available for any country to date and arguably a “gold standard” estimate for Portuguese beliefs and self reactions regarding stuttering. 4.4 Demographic predictors of stuttering attitudes Numerous studies have attempted to explain differences in attitudes toward stuttering related to various demographic variables. In a detailed review of potential predictors (or correlates) of POSHA–S-measured attitudes, St. Louis (2015a,b) considered such variables as familiarity with stuttering, sex, age, socio-economic status (mostly likely manifested as education, occupation, and income), geography (continent or country), language of the questionnaire, and religion. Geography, education, familiarity with stuttering appeared to emerge the most frequently from published and unpublished POSHA–S studies. The current study did document that respondents characterized by younger or middle age, university education, living in the island regions of Portugal, not being retired, and speaking at least three different languages were all associated with more positive attitudes. By contrast, respondents’ sex, marital status, and parental status were not. It should be noted that sex of the respondent has been mentioned often as a predictor of stuttering attitudes, perhaps because one of the first studies to consider it found a significant difference (Burley & Rinaldi, 1986). In fact, the study sampled only 10 male and 10 female respondents. Like Burley and Rinaldi (1986), some studies have shown better attitudes for females than males, especially those with very large sample sizes (e.g., Arnold, Li, & Goltl, 2015; Li & Arnold, 2015). Such studies typically have very small effect sizes, raising questions of how the findings might best be interpreted. Careful studies using the POSHA–S have shown, as the current study did, that sex of the respondent did not make a difference in the attitudes of adults toward stuttering (St. Louis, 2012a; St. Louis, LeMasters, & Poormohammad, 2015). Supporting the lack of relationship between Portuguese parental status and attitudes, a recent study by St. Louis, Weidner, and Mancini (2016) revealed that parents of young children, parents of older children or adult children, and non-parents held very similar attitudes on the Appraisal of the Stuttering Environment (ASE), a clinical instrument that is very similar to the second experimental version of the POSHA–S. More positive stuttering attitudes were associated with achieving higher levels in education, and less positive attitudes were associated with the ≥65yr age group. Comparisons with the two aforementioned probability samples in Turkey using the POSHA–S (Özdemir et al., 2011b), might shed light on these findings. The mean Portuguese age for the 311 respondents was 46 yr compared to 12 yr for the Turkish children, 37 and 38 yr for the parents, 45 and 62 yr for the grandparents/adult relatives (with far more aunts and uncles and far fewer grandparents in the first sample), and 35 and 36 yr for the neighbors. Mean years of school completed in Portugal was 10.3 yr and in Eskişehir, Turkey, 5.0 and 5.0 yr (children), 7.1 and 7.3 yr (parents), 4.8 and 7.0 yr (grandparents/adult relatives), and 7.6 and 8.2 yr (neighbors). It would be reasonable to assume that the differences in education would explain the much less positive attitudes in Eskişehir, Turkey compared to Portugal. However, the lack of large differences in attitudes as a function of age in the Turkish sample suggests that age, per se, might not be a universal predictor of stuttering attitudes. Our analyses suggested that less knowledge of stuttering was an important factor in the older Portuguese age group, but the weighted POSHA–S item for personal experience with stuttering of the groups was −86 for Portugal in comparison to −87 to −92 for Eskişehir, Turkey, or not much different. Speaking more than one language positively influenced the attitudes toward people who stutter in Portugal. Comparisons across samples in the POSHA–S database have not been carried out, so at this point we cannot explain why multilingualism appears to be associated with more positive stuttering attitudes. Though only significant for one versus three languages known, the means in Table 2 suggest that Self Reactions were most different between one or two languages known versus three or four. Different results have also been reported. St. Louis and Roberts (2010) compared Canadian and Cameroonian respondents taking an experimental version of the POSHA–S either in English or French. Importantly, both are official languages in Canada and Cameroon. A control group of monolingual USA respondents taking the POSHA–S English held attitude ratings much more similar to the Canadians than the Cameroonians, irrespective of the latter groups’ knowledge and use of other languages. As it was mentioned in Section 4.1, the current study showed that stuttering attitudes in the Portuguese mainland regions were quite similar. However, statistical significance of the region variable related to the better attitudes in the small island regions of Azores suggest that different factors could have influenced a higher score of the Self Reactions to people who stutter in this region which accounts for less than 5% of the country's population. These predictor findings suggest that future studies of public attitudes adults in circumscribed regions consider age, education, work status, and number of languages known as covariates. Additionally, this study adds support to previous research showing that respondents’ sex, parental status, or marital status are not consistent predictors of better or worse attitudes. 4.5 Strengths, limitations, and future research We have suggested that the care and controls employed in this study which employed a three-stage cluster probability study of the entire country of Portugal arguably have generated the most valid estimate of stuttering attitudes in any single country to date. This is supported by the generally similar percentages of adults in the study versus in the population census summaries. Accordingly, the study's results have substantial potential value in efforts to improve attitudes in Portugal as well as in validation of results from a host of convenience samples in other countries. The methodology of the study can serve as a model for future studies as well. In spite of these strengths, limitations or cautions must be mentioned. First, whereas the return rate was determined to be satisfactory (Babbie, 2006), nearly one half of the individuals handed a questionnaire by staff members at the local administrative offices did not return them. It is possible that those who did not fill them out would have held attitudes different than those who did. If so, then the generalizability would be limited the “typical” individual who not only avails him or herself to the functions of the office but also those who would be likely to fill out a questionnaire that they did not expect to receive. This is similar to questions that could be raised about virtually any study. For example, were the persons on one main street on a heavy shopping day in Flanders, Shanghai, and Rio de Janiero representative of the average adult in their respective countries (Van Borsel et al., 1999; Pereira et al., 2008; Xing Ming et al., 2001)? A follow-up mixed-method study with interviews of a number of potential respondents who did and did not complete the questionnaire would be one way to estimate the effect of such potential selection bias. Additionally and possibly related to the same sampling issue, the alignment of the percentages of respondents in this study with Portuguese census, although generally close, is far from perfect. The regions of Alentejo and Center regions of the country are somewhat over-represented while the North and Lisbon regions are under-represented. Similarly, the 18–24 age group is over-represented, and the 25–64 group is under-represented. This is likely not a serious issue given that the only significant differences which occurred between age groups were between these two younger groups and the ≥65 age group (with this older age group holding the more negative attitudes). It is not clear whether these differences are due to factors related to whether or not potential respondents filled out questionnaires or to who would be more or less likely to visit their local administrative office. We suspect that the latter explanation is the most tenable. Results of the current study suggest several research projects that should be carried out. First, a similar, though not necessarily identical probability sampling procedure should be carried out consistently in several different countries to determine the extent to which probability sampling can distinguish differences between countries as convenience sampling has. If Portugal, Italy, and a Scandinavian country could be included, along with a carefully selected measure of national (or regional) identity, the reasons behind the differences that have been observed between countries might be elucidated. In this process, schemes for probability sampling, beyond the local administrative offices scheme in Portugal and randomly selected schools scheme in Turkey, could be advanced and tested. It is possible that the population of Portugal is more homogeneous than populations of some other countries, such as the USA. If so then yet-to-be tested schemes for probability sampling of stuttering attitudes might be more appropriate in such countries. Second, in probability or convenience sampling with substantial sample sizes, additional predictors of positive and negative stuttering attitudes should be sought. Knowledge of and acquaintance with stuttering is one such predictor that past research has shown to be ambiguous. Third, smaller, convenience samples in Portugal of the general public, or specific occupational groups, should be carried out and compared with the results of the current study to determine when and where probability sampling is required or not required. Fourth, studies should be undertaken in Portugal that attempt to improve public attitudes. Finally, considering the large number of studies that have documented negativity in public attitudes toward stuttering (see reviews by Boyle & Blood, 2015; Hughes, 2015; St. Louis, 2015a,b), one can wonder if additional studies add meaningful information. Agreeing with St. Louis, Sønsterud, et al. (2016) and St. Louis, Weidner, and Mancini (2016), we submit that so long as unexplained, disparate findings are forthcoming, as in differences in attitudes in Italy versus other European countries, continued search for relevant predictor variables are warranted.

However, the physiology and acoustics of the larynx during trumpet playing has seldom been studied. Therefore, the current paper describes the laryngeal articulation during trumpet performance with biomedical signals and auditory perception. The activation of laryngeal musculature of six professional trumpeters when playing a standard musical passage was analysed using audio, eletroglottography (EGG), oxygen saturation and heart rate signals. Two University trumpet teachers listened to the audio recordings, to evaluate the participants' laryngeal effort (answers on a 100 mm Visual-Analogue-Scale (VAS): 0 \"no perceived effort\"; 100 \"extreme effort\"). Correlations between parameters extracted from the EGG data and the perception of the audio stimuli by the teachers were explored. Two hundred and fifty laryngeal articulations, where raising of the larynx and muscular effort were observed, were annotated and analysed. No correlation between the EGG data and the auditory evaluation was observed. However, both teachers perceived the laryngeal effort (VAS mean scores = 61±14). Our findings show that EGG and auditory perception data can provide new insights into laryngeal articulation and breathing control that are key to low muscular tension.",

The results based on the acoustic analysis of 16 speakers' pronunciation, reveal that the new variants of alveolo-palatals are characterised by spectral peaks at higher frequencies and higher centre of gravity values than their Standard Polish counterparts. In addition, spectral moments, spectral slopes and the formants of preceding vowels differentiate the new variants from Standard Polish alveolo-palatals. We provide the rationale for the development of the new variants by referring to (i) a functional approach involving contrast optimisation in the sibilant system, (ii) a sociolinguistic approach that makes use of a sound-symbolic association between energy concentration in higher frequency regions and smallness and (iii) a speech disorder.",

        "doc_abstract": "The Polish system of sibilants is currently undergoing changes in the speech of young women. The innovation involves alveolo-palatals and can be characterised as a change in progress in its initial stage. The change has recently come to the attention of many Poles. The new variants of sibilants connote childishness and immaturity and are heavily stigmatised among users of the standard variants. We present the results of an acoustic study of the new system of sibilants, in which the contrast [s: : ] and [ts: t: t] has been replaced by [s: s: ] and [ts: ts: t]. We have analysed sibilants / s: : / and / ts: t: t / pronounced by 16 speakers and divided them into two equal groups: speakers showing the standard realisations and speakers showing the new realisations of alveolo-palatals (i.e. [s], [ts]). We have investigated the centres of gravity of the sibilants. The results of linear mixed models reveal statistically significant differences between the standard and the new variants of sibilants and lead us to the conclusion that the alveolo-palatal sibilants are currently undergoing changes in their acoustic realisation. In order to explain the social restriction of the change, we refer to the existence of an iconic association between acoustic energy concentration in higher frequency regions and youth or childishness. The change may be seen as a trait of an emerging feminine accent of Polish. We also consider two other explanations for the change: contrast optimisation in the sibilant system and a speech disorder.",

        "doc_abstract": "© The Author(s) 2014.Children with speech sound disorders (SSD) represent a large number of speech and language therapists' caseloads. The intervention with children who have SSD can involve different therapy approaches, and these may be articulatory or phonologically based. Some international studies reveal a widespread application of articulatory based approaches in children with different SSD. In Portugal no survey has been previously conducted about speech and language therapists (SLTs) practices when working with children with SSD, so it is still unknown how SLTs treat children with SSD. This study aims to explore the use of different intervention approaches of SLTs in Portugal, and to describe the approaches most frequently used in treating children who have phonologically based SSD. Data collection was conducted through a questionnaire available on the web platform Advanced Communication and Swallowing Assessment (ACSA; http://acsa.web.ua.pt), and data analysis was based on 88 responses, corresponding to 5% of the total Portuguese SLTs population. Results showed that the intervention approaches most used with children who have SSD are phonological awareness (97% of the participants), auditory discrimination (92%), meaningful minimal contrast therapy (75%) and parent-based work (58%). The great majority of SLTs combined several approaches in their intervention. There was also a high percentage of SLTs that used articulation based approaches, namely articulation work (31%) in cases of phonologically based disorders. Most (63%) SLTs used weekly interventions over a period of more than six months (51%). The data presented here agrees with the results obtained in South African, UK and USA studies in terms of the approaches most frequently used in intervention with children who have phonologically based SSD. Regarding the frequency and duration of intervention, there is a discrepancy between the results obtained and what is commonly used across research. The characteristics described by the Portuguese SLTs for establishing the differential diagnosis of SSD do not always reflect the evidence available in recent literature. The findings presented in this article revealed the intervention approaches that SLTs currently use to treat children with phonologically based SSD and the theoretical foundations that guide their clinical practice. This allows the reader to compare clinical practice of SLTs across countries and research studies.",

We recorded all stops and fricatives in four vowel contexts and two word positions. We computed the devoicing of the time-varying patterns throughout the stop and fricative duration. Our results show that regarding devoicing behaviour, EP is more similar to German than Italian. While Italian shows almost no devoicing of all phonologically voiced consonants, both EP and German show strong and consistent devoicing through the entire consonant. Differences in consonant position showed no effect for EP and Italian, but were significantly different for German. The height of the vowel context had an effect for German and EP. For EP, we showed that a more posterior place of articulation and low vowel context lead to significantly more devoicing. However, in contrast to German, we could not find an influence of consonant position on devoicing. The high devoicing for all phonologically voiced stops and fricatives and the vowel context influence are a surprising new result. With respect to voicing maintenance, EP is more like German than other Romance languages.",

Results showed differences in phonological acquisition of children with phonologically based SSD, namely a low percentage of correct consonants score and a higher percentage of occurrences of typical phonological processes. Children with phonologically based SSD also used phonological processes (e.g., backing and initial consonant deletion) that are considered unusual in normally developing children and were not observed in the TD group. Results for SSD children also showed that early acquisition consonants were substituted by later acquisitions. Children with SSD presented differences in phonological acquisition, unusual phonological processes, and replaced early acquisition consonants by later acquisition consonants.

All rights reserved.Purpose: To describe the cross-cultural adaptation process of the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes (POSHA-S) to European Portuguese (EP). The POSHA-S was developed by the International Project on Atitudes Toward Human Attributes (IPATHA) to measure the public attitudes toward stuttering and people who stutter. The POSHA-S was created to be used internationally, through translation into other languages. Method: The EP translation and adaptation process followed five steps: 1) production of two forward translations; 2) synthesis of the translations; 3) production of two back-translations based on the synthesised version; 4) multidisciplinary expert committee review to develop the pre-final version; 5) cognitive debriefing of the new translation. To assess the agreement between the judges during the cognitive debriefing phase, a modified Bland and Altman (1986) method (Jesus, Valente and Hall 2015, pp. 4-5) was used. Results and discussion: Two forward translations were produced and syntesised by the two translators. Two back-translations were produced by two persons with English as mother tongue. The expert commitee revised the documents in terms of semantic and idiomatic content and conceptual equivalence; the level of agreement was high and discrepancies were solved through a decentering technique. Eight discrepancies relating to the POSHA-S instructions and seven discrepancies with regard to the items were solved. The pre-final version of the POSHA-S in EP was filled in by five native speakers of the translated language and similar to the target population of the assessment tool. Five individuals completed a questionnaire relating to relevance, clarity, simplicity and accuracy of instructions and items, using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The Bland and Altman method revealed that there was one item about which the judges did not agree (simplicity of instructions). The POSHA-S EP version presented good cross-cultural equivalence. Conclusions: The exhaustive traslation and adaptation process of POSHA-S’ original version into EP can be considered a good model to guarantee the equivalence and sensibility of the translated tool, in order to allow comparisons between the attitudes of the general Portuguese public and the total sample of POSHA-S.",

Introduction Respiratory diseases are among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Thus, great research efforts have been devoted to improve their diagnosis and monitoring through technological improvements of lung auscultation as it is a non-invasive, economic and universally available tool2. For the last three decades, scientific research has been contributing for improving the equipment to acquire respiratory sounds (RS)3 and for *Corresponding author.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license Peer-review under responsibility of SciKA - Association for Promotion and Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge 698 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 enhancing the understanding of the clinical meaning of changes occurring in RS4,5. However, these new advances in science have been poorly translated to health professionalsâ€™ academic education6. The education and training of a â€œhands-on professionâ€�, such as health related professions, in an academic setting is challenging as it requires the rationale and the skills to manage authentic patient scenarios, whilst the training is routinely provided with healthy subjects7. Specifically for lung auscultation, it requires the development of skills to: i) understand the principles of acoustics, ii) distinguish between RS and sound artefacts that may be heard in clinical environments (i.e., speech, movement and articular noise resulting from holding the stethoscope), iii) differentiate between normal and adventitious sounds, iv) relate the auscultation with other patientâ€™s characteristics and v) build a clinical rationale based on these parameters6,8. Such skills can be achieved by listening repeatedly to recordings of typical RS without artefacts (such as low and high frequency crackles and wheezes) and visualising their waveforms, but also by identifying these typical RS in recordings acquired from real patients and in clinical environments. Nevertheless, real patients and clinical environments are difficult to find and/or mimic in academic contexts and learning tools are difficult to transport to clinical environments7. Computer-assisted learning tools may help to overcome these difficulties, since they allow students interaction with RS previously recorded in real clinical contexts and from patients with different pathologies, whilst ensuring patient confidentiality7. Also, if properly developed, the computerised learning tool may be suitable to be used by students in their clinical placements where a large variety of cases can be presented and recorded for posterior analysis and discussion. Few computer-assisted learning tools have been developed in the area of respiratory medicine6 and the existing tools do not integrate the latest scientific advances on RS9,10 (e.g., updated nomenclature and clinical interpretation) and/or do not contemplate all the required features for integration of knowledge (e.g., sound recording and analysis)11,12. Furthermore, these tools have not been successfully implemented in academic settings, as it has been reported that most used learning tools in respiratory medicine are still books, standard sounds and websites6. Therefore, we aimed to develop and evaluate a computer-assisted learning application for RS recording, analysis and interpretation. Accordingly, this paper is organised as follows: section 2 presents the tools and methods used to design the application; section 3 describes the results obtained after the usability session, when using CLASS as a learning tool for RS; section 4 discusses the benefits and drawbacks identified in the usability session, and section 5 concludes the paper and presents future work directions. 2. Methodology Computerised Lung Auscultation â€“ Sound System (CLASS) is an open-source application that has been developed based on two previous applications: LungSounds@UA11 and RSAS@UA12. These two applications do not integrate recording and analysis of RS and were developed for research purposes only, using a proprietary software that requires a commercial license (i.e., Matlab). To overcome these drawbacks and take into consideration studentsâ€™ needs, CLASS has been developed in Java, a free and open-source object-oriented programming language. Moreover, Java applications are executed on Java Virtual Machines (JVM) that can be easily installed in most computer platforms. This promotes its use across different operating systems (e.g., Unix, Linux, OS X and Windows)13. 2.1. Design Principles The CLASS application was designed using a User-Centred Design (UCD) process14. UCD facilitates usersâ€™ workflow throughout the application as it supports their current habits and behaviours, instead of requiring them to adapt to the application14. A task-oriented prototyping technique in the analysis requirements phase was used to identify the tasks that users needed to accomplish with the application15. Therefore, users were able to test each task independently during the development of the application (prototypes), whilst other tasks were being developed concurrently. 699 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 2.2. Application structure The application, currently available in English, is organised using tabbed document interfaces (TDI), so that its main features can be displayed in sections easily identified and accessed by the user. This organisation also makes the application visually more pleasant and intuitive16. The application includes: RS recordings with a digital stethoscope; RS files playback; RS files analysis; learning exercises for RS identification and tutorials on RS acoustic properties together with their clinical interpretation. 2.2.1. Authentication The navigation starts with the validation of usersâ€™ credentials to assure data integrity and confidentiality17, through the authentication window, as shown in Fig.1 (a). Then, a main window (see Fig.1 (b)) is displayed containing four TDIs on the top of the page: Main; Recordings; Annotations and Tutorials. The Main TDI is composed of two panels, as shown in Fig.1 (b). Panel P1 displays information about the number of exercises performed by the user, average evaluation of the submitted exercises, number of exercises that reached 80% of agreement on adventitious RS detection (comparing with a multi-annotator gold standard) and current exercise level (i.e., beginner or advanced). Panel P2 presents the user personal information (username and role). 2.2.2. Recordings The Recording TDI is composed of 4 panels as shown in Fig.2 (a). Panel P3 allows to select patients from a pre- configured list, to configure the session (i.e., to select whether the recording is performed before or after the treatment session) and to select the anatomical location where the recording will be performed (i.e., trachea and left and right anterior, lateral and posterior locations). In panel P4 users can select the acquisition device to perform the RS recording and, if applicable, the device used for flow and volume acquisition. The latter is not mandatory to proceed with the RS acquisition. Panel P5 allows RS recordings. After pressing the recording bottom, a recording window (see Fig.2 (b)), with a real time waveform of the acoustic signal being collected, is displayed. A time countdown is visualised (20 seconds are defined by default, but this duration can be modified), and after that, the user is redirected to the Annotations TDI, where annotation of the recorded RS can be performed. Finally, panel P6 is composed by a table containing information about the previously recorded RS for the patient selected in panel P3: recording date and time; anatomical location; session and filename. Also, users may select a RS from the table to: annotate that sound; repeat the recording; remove the sound from the list. Figure 1. (a)Authentication window. (b) Main tabbed document interface. 700 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 2.2.3. Annotations The Annotation TDI (see Fig.3(a)) allows users to playback RS files and to manually annotate respiratory phases and adventitious RS, i.e., wheezes and crackles. The process for sound playback and/or annotation starts in panel P7, where users can list and select a specific RS, depending on the patient, clinical condition or exercise level they are interested in. After RS selection, the sound is displayed in panel P8 in a waveform display and users may play the sound and/or activate the noise filter. This will filter frequencies below 100 Hz and higher than 2000 Hz, which are outside the bandwidth of interest to detect adventitious RS18, and thus will facilitate the annotation process. The sound volume and reproducing rate (i.e., reduction of the reproducing rate to half of the normal rate or reproduction at normal rate) can also be selected in this panel19,20. This will further facilitate the accurate annotation of the beginning and end of a respiratory phase and/or adventitious RS. The annotation process and management of annotations are available in panels P9, P10 and P11. Here, users can select which annotation information (i.e., crackles, wheezes and respiratory phases or all) they want to see in the plot along with the RS waveform, manage annotation data (add or remove annotation, clear annotation list and change annotation type) and submit annotations. After submitting an annotation, the user can visualise it by selecting the corresponding RS file. The Annotations TDI also allows users to train their skills on RS annotation, by annotating pre-selected RS files and comparing their annotations with a multi-annotator gold standard (i.e., a set of annotations performed by at least three different respiratory experts). These exercises are divided into two levels: beginner and advanced. At a beginner level, users simply select a RS file from the â€œexercisesâ€� list (presented in panel P7) and perform its annotation. After submitting their annotation, users receive a report on their percentage of agreement with the gold standard, as well as a visual feedback of his/her performance, i.e., the gold standard annotation overlaps with the annotation performed by the user (presented in yellow in Fig.3(a), panel P8). After five annotations with at least Figure 2. (a) Recording tabbed document interface; (b) Recording performance window. Figure 3. (a) Annotation tabbed document interface (b) Tutorials tabbed document interface 701 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 80% of agreement with the gold standard, the advanced level of exercises becomes available. In this level, users are presented with a RS file previously automatically annotated and have to verify if those annotations are correct and if the RS is fully annotated. If these premises are not verified, the exercise consists of performing the required corrections. After exercise submission, the process is similar to what has been previously described for the beginner level. 2.2.4. Tutorials The Tutorials TDI, shown in Fig.3 (b), has two entries containing normal and adventitious RS. For each sound, the user can visualise the RS waveform, play the sound and learn about the clinical features usually related with that type of sound, according to the most recent findings of RS classification4. 2.3. Usability assessments CLASS was developed and iteratively assessed (with informal evaluations) during its design process by identifying the problems that users (four independent respiratory researchers) had when interacting with the application and performing the required corrections to solve those problems. Then, when a final version of CLASS was produced, it was submitted to a formal usability panel composed of eight physiotherapy students without any prior knowledge of the application and its general structure. Prior to the usability panel session, all participants gave their informed consents, answered a background questionnaire about their expertise and usage of computer applications21 and enrolled in an exploratory and instruction-based training session22 for approximately 60 minutes. Participants also received training manuals describing the general structure of CLASS. Two researchers involved in the development of the application (the first and third authors) were present during the training session23-25. Two days after the training session, eight validation sessions were performed. Students were distributed in individual rooms in each validation session. Each student received a pre structured case study. The case study followed the workflow scenario of a patient with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease who went to a hospital and had his/her RS recorded by a health professional for further analysis. The case study also included an evaluation of the participantsâ€™ skills to detect adventitious RS by asking them to perform a beginner and an advanced exercise. After completing the case study, participants were asked to fill in a user experience questionnaire26 and to participate in a focus group interview27, to gain insight into their experience when interacting with the application. The focus group themes were selected following a semi-structured discussion guide28 and included: relevance, ease of navigation, alert messages, design, layout and content organisation, areas of application, problems and suggestions for improving CLASS. The focus group interview lasted for approximately 20 minutes and was video recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. 3. Results Participants (3 male; 20.5 Â± 0.5 years) had previous experience with software applications either for academic (n=8; 100%) or leisure purposes (n=6; 75%). One participant reported having had previous bad experiences with software applications and three students (38%) reported having already used an application similar to CLASS. In the post session questionnaires, participants stated that the application was easy (n=8; 100%) and pleasant to use (n=7; 88%), that it had good design (n=7; 88%) and was consistent regarding the order in which the contents were displayed (n=8; 100%). However, five participants (63%) reported that they were not able to be independent in their interaction with the application and two (25%) found some annoying characteristics, such as the gold standard appearing suddenly after the submission of the annotations and the absence of a timeline in the annotation process. 3.1. Focus group interview The results obtained in the eight pre-established themes for the focus group are presented below. 702 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 Relevance: Five participants (63%) agreed that CLASS is a useful application. The importance of having the Tutorials TDI was highly emphasised, as it provides a valuable platform to learn about the RS characteristics. Ease of navigation: Most participants (n=6; 75%) agreed that CLASS is easy to navigate and perform tasks and that the TDI organisation was a smart approach, which facilitated the navigation. Alert messages: Six participants (75%) agreed that alert messages were understandable and helpful. However, since all messages appeared in red, users felt that they were committing errors all the time. Design: All participants (n=8; 100%) thought that CLASS had a simple, efficient and functional design. Layout and content organisation: Two participants (25%) agreed that the content presented on the application was well chosen and four (50%) further stated that the application did not need any additional content to be useful for academic purposes. Areas of application: Six participants (75%) stated that, if available, they would use CLASS for educational purposes, instead the classic learning tools (i.e., books, standard RS recordings and websites). They pointed out the fact that having CLASS as an educational tool, would make them more prepared for clinical placements, since they would be able to recognise adventitious RS ahead of actually being with patients. It was also stated by six participants (75%) that the use of CLASS in clinical placements would be of great value, as it would allow to record patientsâ€™ auscultations and then perform a more detailed analysis at home. Three participants (38%) also reported that CLASS would allow students to objectify their findings before and after treatment, as it allows analysis of RS recordings at different instances in time. Problems: All participants reported difficulties recording and/or annotating RS. Five participants (63%) stated that after performing a RS recording, it was not clear which steps were required to save the RS file. Also, after saving the recording (see Fig.2 (b)), the patient in which the recording was being performed, was automatically deselected in the recording configuration window (see Fig.2 (a), panel P3), causing participants to have to reselect the patient every time they wanted to record a different anatomical site of auscultation. Five participants (63%) also reported difficulties in inserting respiratory phases and adventitious RS, mainly due to the absence of a dynamic time cursor, which would follow the waveform while the sound was played back. Editing difficulties were due to the absence of an edit option, i.e., every time participants made a mistake in inserting a respiratory phase or adventitious RS, that annotation had to be deleted and inserted again. It was also mentioned by two participants (25%) that the application did not allow them to change between TDIs without losing unsaved annotations. This was pointed as the major limitation of the application, since it did not allow participants to consult the tutorials while they were performing the annotations. Suggestions: Regarding the Recording TDI, two participants (25%) suggested that the â€œsession typeâ€� (see Fig. 2, panel P3) should have an intermediate option, to allow students to record patientsâ€™ RS not only at beginning and end of the treatment session, but also between the application of different physiotherapy techniques in the same session. In the Annotation TDI (see Fig. 3(a)), five participants (63%) suggested that undo/redo buttons should be added to allow users to go backward and forward during the annotation process. Participants also suggested replacing the RS list with encoded identifications by a table with the RS characteristics, as it is presented in the Recordings TDI (see Fig. 2 (a), panel P6). All participants suggested the insertion of a vertical time cursor in the waveform plot, so they could have a visual feedback of the RS time instant they were currently listening. Regarding to the presentation of the gold-standard, it was suggested that this should not automatically appear when an annotation is performed. Instead, users should have the option to select it, if and when he/she wants to visualise it. Two participants (25%) also suggested changing the colours in which the gold standard was being presented to distinguish it from the userâ€™s annotation. Four participants (50%) stated that the use of CLASS in lectures and clinical placements would increase the interest of students about lung auscultation. Hence, it was suggested that it could be inserted in studentsâ€™ curricular plan and workshops could be developed to those who were already in clinical placements. 4. Discussion This study presented a computer-assisted learning application (CLASS) to be used by students in academic and clinical placements for learning purposes. The usability evaluation conducted with the application highlighted its great potential to boosts studentsâ€™ skills on lung auscultation. Moreover, the use of CLASS may potentiate studentsâ€™ motivation to use auscultation later in their clinical practice. 703 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 CLASS combines in a single application a learning tool that can be used to teach both RS acquisition and interpretation. Also, being multi-platform and based on open source components, it can run in studentsâ€™ personal computers and thus be taken to their clinical placements, enabling the learning process to be extended outside of the academic environment. This advantage is not found in any similar existing RS applications, such as MARS Database29, LungSounds@UA11 and RSAT@UA12. Although authors claimed that those applications could also be used for learning purposes29, there are no reports of usability validation tests occurring with Health Sciences students. Also, none of these tools integrate recording, annotation and tutorials about RS in the same application. Recently, some educational websites have emerged which integrate RS recordings and exercises for diagnosis training30,31. Although very useful to train auscultation in RS recordings without artefacts, these websites do not provide examples of RS recordings in real clinical environments, where the sound file is often contaminated with several artefacts that need to be distinguished from RS. Additionally, only examples of specific auscultation places, mostly lower lobes and trachea, are provided. It is known that RS characteristics differ from upper, middle and lower lobes32, and thus it is essential to train students to recognise and understand those differences, as it is possible with CLASS. The potential of the application to be used in clinical placements was the advantage most highlighted by participants in the focus group. Participants valued the fact that, by using CLASS, they could share and discuss their annotations pre (base) and post a physiotherapy treatment with their tutors and peers. It is known that although students appreciate computer tutorials acting as a supplement to their educational activities, they do not favour them as the primary or exclusive method of education delivery7. In fact, they perceive their interaction with other classmates and lecturers as an integral part of the learning process7. Hence, although CLASS is a computer-assisted learning application, that allows students to record and analyse their own sound files, it creates the opportunity to generate scientific discussions between lecturers and students, addressing doubts that may never emerge with the isolated RS sound files usually used in the conventional teaching method. This may not only motivate students, but also instructors as they might feel students more engaged in their own learning process33. Despite the great number of advantages reported by participants, some suggestions were given for future improvements, namely regarding the gold standard visualisation, alert messages design, RS recording/storage procedures, patientâ€™s selection remembrance between tasks, inclusion of a timeline during RS playback, annotation editing and navigation between TDIs during an annotation session. 5. Conclusion and Future Work The design of successful computer-assisted learning applications is one of the main challenges in the area of respiratory medicine6. According to our best knowledge, CLASS is the only computer-assisted learning tool that simultaneously allows recording and analysis of RS. Despite of the drawbacks addressed in the usability assessment, the utility has great potential to be used both in academic and clinical environments. New developments are being implemented to meet usersâ€™ requirements, and new standardised evaluation models are being analysed for future usability assessments, such as the USE-IT and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires. An improved version of this application is also being prepared to be used by health professionalsâ€™ and researchers in their practice.

However, few have been developed in the area of respiratory medicine and the majority does not include all the required features for integration of knowledge (e.g., sound recording and analysis). Thus, we aimed to develop and evaluate an open-source computer-assisted learning application for respiratory sound recording, analysis and interpretation, the Computerised Lungs Auscultation – Sound Software (CLASS). CLASS is the only computer-assisted learning tool which simultaneously allows the recording and analyses of respiratory sounds. The usability of CLASS has been tested by eight physiotherapy students through an open-ended questionnaire and a focus group interview. Participants highlighted its utility and great potential to be used in academic and clinical environments, and they also identified some drawbacks. New developments are being incorporated to improve CLASS usability in the academic context but also to make it available in health professionals’ clinical practice.

The dashed grey lines and numbers in the glottis panel show for comparison the configuration for the same stimulus but with 50% fricative voicing maintenance. Please note that the durations given are the control parameters for the articulatory synthesiser. Fig. 2 Area functions for EP fricatives (labiodental, alveolar and postalveolar place of articulation) and the vowel /a/ (in black solid lines) in terms of 40 cross-sections (tube sections) between the glottis and the mouth. The first tube section represents the glottis end of the vocal tract. The articulator that confines the vocal tract at the anterior-inferior side at each of the 40 sections is given on top of each line (T=tongue, I=incisors, L=lip, N=other). The information about the articulators is used by the synthesiser VocalTractLab 2.1 to facilitate noise source modelling for fricative generation (Birkholz, 2014). The red dashed lines represent the area function with a pharyngeal width increased by 20% (used as a factor in the second perception experiment). Fig. 3 Results of the first perception experiment: The listeners’ response probability that a voiced fricative was heard is shown on the ordinate. The abscissa shows the stimulus voicing maintenance percentage (0%=fully voiceless, 100%=fully voiced), the different panels show the three EP places of articulation for fricatives from anterior to posterior, and the different lines of each plot show the factor fricative duration. Shown are means plus/minus one standard error. Fig. 4 Results of the second perception experiment: The listeners’ response probability that a voiced fricative was heard is shown on the ordinate. The abscissa shows the stimulus voicing maintenance percentage (0%=fully voiceless, 100%=fully voiced), the three rows show the three EP places of articulation for fricatives from anterior to posterior (left to right). The upper three panels show the listeners’ response probability for varying glottis height (high, low, normal), and the lower three panels show the results for varying pharyngeal width (normal, 10% wider, 20% wider). The plots show means plus/minus one standard error.

Furthermore, new insights into laryngeal vs. supra-laryngeal gestural coordination are gained which may facilitate the development of fricative models. Keywords Fricative synthesis Fricative voicing Cue weighting European Portuguese Voicing perception 1 Introduction For speech production, the phonological voicing distinction is defined as the presence or absence of vocal fold vibration during consonant production (Jakobson et al., 1952). For the perception of intervocalic fricative voicing, Stevens et al. (1992) showed in a study of American English that alveolar fricatives, generated with a Klatt (1980) synthesiser, are perceived as voiced if the voiced part of (a partly devoiced) fricative exceeds a duration of 30ms. Furthermore, when the devoiced part of the (otherwise voiced) fricative exceeds a duration of 60ms the listener robustly perceives a voiceless fricative. Having established this baseline for the perception of voicing, in their data, Stevens et al. (1992) compared these perception results to an acoustic study conducted beforehand and showed that all of their phonologically voiced fricatives devoiced for less than 60ms, and 89% of their phonologically voiceless fricatives were voiceless for more than 60ms. In other words, as expected, the percentage of voicing maintenance (defined as the duration of voicing during fricative production in percent of the total fricative duration) was very high for phonologically voiced English fricatives, but very low for phonologically voiceless fricatives. In contrast to the findings of Stevens et al. (1992), Cho and Giavazzi (2008) observed a linear relation of alveolar fricative voicing in American English listeners, with the result that all listeners showed a linear increase of their voicing responses for increasing vocal fold vibration duration (i.e., for increasing voicing maintenance). It has to be noted that when stimuli were presented with only very small portions of fricative voicing (i.e., a few ms) for all listeners a consistent initial bias towards voiced responses was observed, all in comparison to the presentation of fricatives without any voicing. In other words, the linear relationship between stimulus voicing and perception of voicing is not observed for the beginning of the voicing continuum. Rivas (2006) compared Dutch and Italian listeners with respect to their cue-weighting between frication duration and voicing maintenance. They found that for both languages listeners mainly depended on voicing maintenance to discriminate voiced and voiceless alveolar fricatives. Following Rivas (2006), we will use in this paper the term voicing maintenance as the percentage of voicing to the length of the entire fricative. This measure is the ratio of the duration of the voiced section to the length of the entire fricative, times 100, expressed in percentage. Apart from the fricative voicing maintenance, both Stevens et al. (1992), Cho and Giavazzi (2008) showed that varying the duration of the fricative noise had a small, but consistent effect on the identification of voicing for American English listeners, with the effect being more pronounced for shorter fricative durations (the shorter the duration, the more the fricative was perceived as voiceless). Denes (1955) showed the same relationship for Dutch intervocalic alveolar fricatives, but Rivas (2006) could only find a very minor effect of fricative noise duration on listeners’ identification of voicing for the same place of articulation. With respect to the preceding and following vowel duration, both Denes (1955) and Slis and Cohen (1969) showed that the preceding vowel duration strongly influences the perception of listeners’ fricative voicing for Dutch, with longer vowels triggering more voiced fricative responses. Cho and Giavazzi (2008) replicated these results for American English and could confirm the effect of the following vowel duration. In summary, for fricative perception the importance of the three factors (fricative voicing maintenance, its duration and the preceding vowel duration) seems to be comparable to the perception of stops (see, e.g., Pape and Jesus (2014a) for an overview of stop voicing cues in perception). Furthermore, there seems to be both uncertainty and language-dependency with respect to the use of the available acoustic cues for identifying voiced vs. voiceless fricatives (fricative duration, preceding vowel duration or voicing maintenance) and especially how cue-trading between different acoustic cues is mediated by the perceptual system for the language in question. If the results of Stevens et al. (1992) were valid for all languages, listeners of European Portuguese (EP) would judge the majority of the phonologically voiced fricative productions in the EP database by Pape and Jesus (2015) as voiceless, since most of them are highly devoiced, independent of their place of articulation and vowel context. In other words, if the presence of voicing during the fricative portion of the stimulus was the main factor for voiced/voiceless distinction, then most of EP voiced items would be judged voiceless. Thus, apparently additional cues take over (separately or combined) to result in a robust perceptual voicing distinction, and are weighted against the maintenance of fricative voicing. This discrepancy between the phonetic realisations of the EP production data and the expected perceptual responses based on Stevens et al. (1992) and other studies lead directly to our research questions, i.e., whether (1) perceptual ratings in fact mirror the very low voicing maintenance of EP phonologically voiced fricatives in speech production (Pape and Jesus, 2014b, 2015; Jesus and Shadle, 2002; Jesus and Shadle, 2003b; Pinho et al., 2012) and (2) cue-weighting between acoustic cues like preceding vowel duration, fricative duration and fricative voicing maintenance would occur for EP fricative perception. The second research question is particularly difficult to answer due to findings that cue-weighting is listener-dependent, i.e., some listeners give more weight to certain acoustic cues than others. Furthermore, redundant cues often enter into trading relationships; thus, increasing the amount of certain cues while at the same time decreasing the amount of other cues may generate the same perceptual outcome. In the present study, we performed perception experiments to assess these two questions. In general, methods to define and build a multidimensional stimuli space for perceptual experiments should be able to generate realistic articulatory targets, while simultaneously allowing independent parametric control of perceptual parameters, such as fricative duration, vowel duration and transition duration. The most realistic perceptual stimuli would consist of naturally recorded speech, but in this condition there is no control of the presence and strength of possible perceptual cues, thus introducing an unwanted perceptual bias to the experiment. On the other hand, articulatory synthesis can generate realistic articulatory targets and the independent parametric control of all relevant parameters, but suffered until recently from very poor noise generation capabilities. For our study, we overcame this drawback by using an articulatory speech synthesiser with a sophisticated noise source model for stimuli generation, where all relevant parameters of the stimuli could be controlled at a physiological level (Birkholz, 2013, 2014; Birkholz et al., 2011; Birkholz and Jackèl, 2004). Furthermore, using an articulatory synthesiser allowed us to examine the perceptual relevance of two additional differences in the production of voiced vs. voiceless fricatives: Studies using EMMA and MRI data have shown that in sustained productions there are no significant articulatory differences with respect to the place of the main articulator between voiced and voiceless fricatives in English (Narayanan et al., 1995) and EP (Martins et al., 2008). However, Narayanan et al. (1995) and Proctor et al. (2010) showed that the area functions extracted from English MRI images varied significantly with respect to pharyngeal width and glottis height when comparing voiced and voiceless fricatives with the same place of articulation. Martins et al. (2008) confirmed these differences for the pharyngeal width for EP fricatives. Until now, it is not clear whether aerodynamic demands, enhancement of speech economy, or perceptual reasons (i.e., to increase the distinctiveness of robust acoustic cues) are responsible for this articulatory difference in voiced versus voiceless fricative production. We therefore aim to test possible perceptual correlates of these production differences between voiced and voiceless fricatives by including the factors pharyngeal width and glottis height into the design of the perception experiment. 2 Method 2.1 Stimulus construction 2.1.1 Synthesis method The stimuli were generated with the articulatory speech synthesiser VocalTractLab 2.1 (Birkholz, 2013) using the function “Synthesise from tube sequence file”. This function allows the synthesis of speech utterances from a user-defined sequence of vocal tract area functions and glottal configurations. The sequence of area functions specifies the temporal variation of the vocal tract shape. As in key frame animation in computer graphics, the user defines a number of key area functions at arbitrary points in time, between which the area function is linearly interpolated. In the same way, the temporal variation of the vocal fold configuration is specified by multiple key vocal fold configurations in terms of vocal fold model parameters. The vocal fold model underlying the synthesis is the self-oscillating two-mass model by Birkholz et al. (2011), the fundamental frequency was set to 100Hz (thus resulting in a male synthesis voice). The aero-acoustic simulation is based on the transmission-line model of the vocal tract as defined by Birkholz and Jackèl (2004) and is running in the time-domain. It considers losses due to yielding vocal tract walls, viscous friction, turbulence and radiation. The simulation includes a sophisticated noise source model (Birkholz, 2014) for the synthesis of fricatives. The main feature of the noise source model is that it takes into account the place of articulation for the specification of potential noise sources during fricative production. This allows using tailored noise source properties (spectral shape and amplitude) that inherently consider place-specific geometric conditions of the vocal tract for the synthesis of very natural-sounding fricatives. Since the place of articulation cannot be reliably determined from the classic area function, the enhanced area function has been introduced by Birkholz (2014). This function adds the identity of the articulator that confines the vocal tract at the anterior-inferior side as a new layer of information to the area function (see Fig. 2 in Section 2.1.3). This allows the reliable discrimination of places of articulation of fricatives and therefore the effective parameterisation of noise sources. Fig. 1 illustrates the synthesis of the /aCa/ utterances in this study. The bottom half of Fig. 1 shows how the articulators were controlled, the upper half shows the resulting speech signal. The subglottal pressure was set to 1kPa through the whole utterance. The vocal tract (in terms of its area function) was set to the state for /a/ at the beginning of the utterance (landmark 1, top of Fig. 1). After a steady state interval for /a/ (landmark 2), there was a 50ms linear transition from the vocal tract state for /a/ to the vocal tract state for the fricative (landmark 3). The transition was followed by a steady state interval for the fricative (up to landmark 4), a 50ms transition back to /a/ (landmark 5), and a steady state interval for the final /a/ (up to landmark 6). The durations of the steady state intervals were adjusted such that the intended phoneme durations were produced. The state of the vocal folds was set to a configuration appropriate for modal phonation during the initial vowel and the following voiced portion of the fricative. This phase was followed by a 50ms linear transition towards an open glottis state appropriate for voiceless excitation. In the final part of the fricative the vocal fold configuration was changed back to the modal phonation state, which was sustained during the final vowel. The start time of the glottal transition towards voiceless excitation was determined by the intended degree of fricative voicing. In the case of 75% or 100% fricative voicing, the fully open glottis state was not achieved, because the time was too short for a full abduction–adduction cycle. The example in Fig. 1 shows the synthesis of /aʃa/ with a preceding vowel duration of 110ms, a fricative duration of 160ms and a voicing maintenance of 25% (first 25% of the fricative is voiced, the following 75% of the fricative is devoiced). 2.1.2 Language-specific phoneme durations To obtain both phoneme durations and transition durations as input for the synthesis, we measured the appropriate EP durations in an extensive speech production database (see Pape and Jesus, 2015) generated for this purpose. The database was recorded for six EP speakers, consisting of /CV1CV1/ items in the frame sentence Diga CVCV outra vez (“Say CVCV again”), with all EP fricatives /f v s z ʃ ʒ/ in four symmetric vowel contexts /i e o a/. Each item was repeated 9 times in a randomised order. Vowel and consonant boundaries were defined based on the onset and offset of stable formant structure. Table 1 shows the duration measures for the medial fricative (CVCV) in low vowel context /a/ (since we used only this vowel context for the perception stimuli in the present study). As can be seen, the consonant duration (CVCV) is higher for voiceless fricatives, and the vowel preceding the fricative (CVCV) is longer for the voiced fricative as compared to its voiceless counterpart. In contrast, the following vowels (CVCV) have rather similar durations with respect to the overall voiceless–voiced distinction. The total percentage for EP fricative devoicing (a phonologically voiced fricative was counted as devoiced if voicing is absent for at least one glottal period within the fricative) was 47% for EP labiodentals, 60% for alveolars and 54% for postalveolars. In sum, the EP data show clear differences for both preceding vowel and fricative duration between voiceless and voiced fricatives. The durations shown in Table 1 are consistent with other acoustic studies of EP consonants (Delgado Martins, 1975; Jesus and Shadle, 2003a; Veloso, 1995a,b). 2.1.3 Language-specific area functions We analysed vocal tract MRI data of EP phonemes (Martins et al., 2008) to obtain the enhanced area functions necessary for the stimuli synthesis. The reason we adapted the area functions to Portuguese instead of using the German default values distributed with the software VocalTractLab 2.1 (Birkholz, 2013) was that the fricative place of articulation is language-dependent, e.g., the constriction of the EP postalveolar fricative is more fronted than the German counterpart, as could be confirmed by the comparison of the German and EP area functions. Area functions for the three voiceless fricatives /f s ʃ/ were obtained from MRI images of a male speaker for the sustained fricative productions in the low vowel context /a/ (details of the MRI recordings are given in Martins et al., 2008). The precise place of constriction was manually fine-tuned when necessary and the width of the constriction was set to 15mm2. The manual corrections were necessary due to the limited resolution of the MRI images of the EP fricatives and therefore limitations for an accurate extraction of constriction areas are observed. The appropriateness of the EP stimuli set was constantly (acoustically) checked during stimuli generation in a pilot test with six EP listeners until all EP listeners judged the complete set as “very natural” for their native language. Fig. 2 shows the EP area functions used to model the three fricatives and the vowel /a/ with annotations for each tube indicating the confining articulator (Birkholz, 2014). For the second stimuli set, the area functions for the wider pharynx conditions were obtained by adding an additional 10% or 20% to the original values of the first twenty tube areas (counted from the glottis), all weighted by a Hanning window to avoid artificial discontinuities of the area functions. Thus, the areas of the first 20 of the 40 tubes are enlarged by 10% or 20%, weighted by a Hanning window with its maximum at the 10th tube section. The red lines in Fig. 2 show the 20% increase in the pharyngeal width for all EP fricatives. The area functions for the higher/lower glottis condition (also second stimuli set) were obtained by reducing/enlarging the sixth to 20th tube section lengths by an amount that results in a total increase or decrease of the length of the area function by 1cm. In other words, only the pharyngeal part of the area function (tubes 6–20) was lengthened/shortened by a total of 1cm, which is a realistic articulatory setting (including the setting for the tongue root) for a raised/lowered glottis condition. The lengthening/shortening of the pharyngeal cavity is the equivalent to a lowering/raising of the glottis in terms of area function computation. 2.2 Perception experiment Forty (40) female native EP listeners were recruited. The mean age was 20years (standard deviation 1year). All listeners were in the second year of their university education (Health Sciences) at the University of Aveiro (Portugal). They did not receive course credit or financial compensation for their participation. None of the listeners reported speech or hearing problems. The majority of the subjects (n =36) were from the same dialectal region (Dialetos Setentrionais, according to Segura, 2013), three subjects were from the southern dialectical region (Dialetos Centro-meridionais), and one subject was from the Azores islands (Dialetos Insulares). Each participant first listened to three repetitions of the first set of stimuli (3×135 items in total), and after a short break to three repetitions of the second set of stimuli (once more 3×135 items). The stimuli were presented in randomised order. The listeners were informed that they would hear synthetic VCV items. For each item (/aCa/), they were asked to identify whether the presented fricative was voiced or voiceless. The listeners were encouraged to respond as quickly as possible, but also as accurately as possible. Items could not be repeated. The average time to perform the two experiments was 30min. The items were presented over open headphones with a linear frequency response (Sennheiser HD 600) connected to the internal headphone output of a notebook computer (no other processes running, all networking interfaces disabled). Listeners’ responses were collected by means of mouse clicks placed on different buttons on the screen. Listeners were seated in a soundproof room (size around 3m by 2m) at University of Aveiro’s Speech, Language and Hearing Laboratory (SLHlab). We used Alvin v 1.27 (Hillenbrand and Gayvert, 2005) open source software for stimulus and visual presentation. The computer screen showed two buttons labelled “vozeada” (“voiced”) and “não-vozeada” (“voiceless”), one on the left side and one on the right side (at identical distances), around a “next” button at the screen centre. After selecting their response, listeners had to click on the “next” button to proceed to the next stimulus, thus placing the cursor at the exact centre of the screen before the next stimulus presentation (to guarantee identical distances for the two answer possibilities). All button options and accompanying text were written in Portuguese in order to not confuse listeners’ internal language presentation. The placement of all buttons was rotated 180° for one half of the listener population, thus counterbalancing biases of horizontal movement and listener preference. A selection of the stimuli used in the perception experiment is provided as supplemental material to this paper to allow the reader to verify the high synthesis quality of the fricatives. 2.3 Statistical analysis To test the statistical validity of the listeners’ response patterns in the identification experiments a series of Logit models with mixed effects (Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), function lmer (Bates et al., 2011) were performed in the R environment (R Development Core Team, 2008). Logit models are suited for dependent variables with binomial distributions (using z-scores). This allowed statistical modelling based on binary decisions (Baayen, 2008), as is the case with the listener responses obtained (“voiced” or “voiceless” response). 2.4 Summary In order to study the conditions under which EP fricatives are perceived as voiced or voiceless, we used articulatory speech synthesis to generate a number of /aCa/ stimuli, where C were labiodental, alveolar, and postalveolar fricatives. Across these stimuli, we varied the duration of the preceding vowel /a/, the duration of the fricative, the percentage of voicing maintenance during fricative production, and other articulatory parameters. These stimuli were then judged by 40 native EP listeners as containing either a voiced or a voiceless fricative in a forced choice identification task. The stimuli to be judged consisted of two sets. In the first set, for each of the three places of articulation /aCa/ stimuli were generated for all combinations of three vowel durations (using the same duration for both the initial and final vowel), three fricative durations, and five degrees of the fricative voicing maintenance) according to Table 2 , yielding a total of 3×3×3×5=135 stimuli. The phoneme durations were derived from a database of EP speech recordings (Pape and Jesus, 2015), and language-specific articulatory targets were determined using midsagittal outlines, obtained from 2D MRI data of all fricatives and vowels (Martins et al., 2008). For the second set of stimuli, fixed phoneme durations of 135ms for both vowel and consonant were used. These constitute ambiguous values with regard to the perception of fricative voicing (Section 2.1.2). The place of articulation and percentage of voicing maintenance were varied as in the first set, but in addition the pharyngeal width (standard area function width vs. 10% increased width vs. 20% increase width) and height of the glottis (standard area function height vs. 1cm lowered vs. 1cm raised). Standard area function refers to the values extracted from the area functions of the voiceless EP fricatives shown in Martins et al. (2008). Variation of pharyngeal width and glottis height was motivated by the observations by Narayanan et al. (1995) and Proctor et al. (2010), who showed that American English voiced and voiceless fricative area functions differ with respect to glottal height and pharyngeal width. The four factors and their levels are summarised in Table 3 . All combinations of these factors yielded 3×3×3×5=135 stimuli for the second set. 3 Results 3.1 Experiment 1 (first stimuli set) We ran a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with the fixed factors voicing maintenance [0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%], fricative duration [110ms, 135ms, 160ms], preceding vowel duration [110ms, 135ms, 160ms], repetition [1, 2, 3] and fricative place of articulation (POA) [labiodental, alveolar, postalveolar]. The dependent (binomial) variable was the listeners’ voiced/voiceless decision. Listener was included as a random variable. All fixed factors (except fricative POA) were centred and normalised before computation of the LMM. The two factors voicing maintenance (z =39.09, p <.001) and fricative duration (z =−2.74, p =0.006) had a significant effect on the listeners’ voiced/voiceless decision, but the preceding vowel duration did not (z =1.73, p =0.08). The fricative POA was significant, but only for labiodentals (labiodental to alveolar: z =−5.06, p <.001; labiodental to postalveolar: z =4.14 p <.0001; alveolar to postalveolar: z =1.1, p =0.27). The factor repetition was not significant (z =−1.77, p =0.08). The factors fricative POA and voicing maintenance interacted significantly. At 25% voicing maintenance, listeners were more likely to label labiodental fricatives as voiced than alveolar or postalveolar fricatives, while at 75% and 100% voicing maintenance, they were slightly less likely to label the labiodentals voiced. Fig. 3 shows clear ceiling effects for both the absence of voicing maintenance (0%) and high amounts of voicing maintenance (75–100%). Thus, the presence or absence of fricative voicing is the dominant cue for the listeners’ voicing decision. However, if the fricative voicing is rather ambiguous, e.g., if only 25–50% of the fricative duration is voiced (and thus the rest of the fricative duration devoiced), then the listeners’ voicing decision seems to be influenced by all three main factors with strong interactions: voicing maintenance (higher voicing decisions for more fricative voicing), fricative duration (higher voicing decisions for shorter fricative durations, but only for 25–50% voicing maintenance) and place of articulation (higher voicing decisions for labiodental than for alveolar or postalveolar fricatives, but restricted to the intermediate region of voicing maintenance). 3.2 Experiment 2 (second stimuli set) In the second perception experiment both fricative duration and preceding vowel duration were set to fixed values (135ms for both fricative and vowel duration), i.e., the duration values were in an intermediate and thus ambiguous range with respect to the voiced–voiceless decision with the aim to force listeners to base their decisions on other cues. We ran a GLMM with the fixed factors voicing maintenance [0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%], pharynx width [normal, 10% wider, 20% wider], glottis height [normal, 1cm lowered, 1cm raised], repetition [1, 2, 3] and fricative POA [labiodental, alveolar, postalveolar]. The dependent (binomial) variable was the listeners’ voiced/voiceless decision. Listener was included as random variable. All fixed factors (except fricative POA) were centred and normalised before computation of the LMM. Again, the factor voicing maintenance (z =39.36, p <.001) had a significant effect on the listeners’ voiced/voiceless decision, but not the variation of the other factors pharynx width (z =0.05, p =0.96) or repetition (z =−0.87, p =0.38). Glottis height was nearly significant (z =−1.69, p =0.09), so there seems to be an influence of glottis height on listeners voiced responses, though it was not strong enough to reach significance with our methodological setup. The fricative POA was significant, but only for labiodentals (labiodental to alveolar: z =2.28, p <.023; labiodental to postalveolar: z =−3.2, p =0.0014; alveolar to postalveolar: z =−0.816, p =0.41). The factors fricative POA and voicing maintenance interacted significantly (z =−2.218, p =0.027): Listeners were more likely to label labiodental fricatives as voiced than alveolar or postalveolar fricatives, but only at the 50–75% voicing maintenance. Fig. 4 shows this effect and gives an overview of all listener responses for the second perception experiment, with the data split by the factors voicing maintenance, pharynx width, glottis height and place of articulation. 4 Discussion and conclusions In order to conduct a perceptual experiment examining European Portuguese (EP) fricative voicing decisions, physically realistic vowel–fricative–vowel stimuli were modelled by means of articulatory synthesis. The input to the synthesiser, i.e., phoneme identities, phoneme durations, and devoicing patterns, were obtained from an extensive EP real speech corpus. The models (voicing patterns) for the generation of different devoicing conditions were based on the voicing curves in the EP database (Pape and Jesus, 2015). 4.1 Voicing maintenance in production and perception We have shown that the factor voicing maintenance is the major cue for listeners’ voicing identification for EP fricatives. Furthermore, there was a significant effect of both place of articulation and fricative duration: The shorter the fricative duration, the more the listeners judged the stimuli as voiced. These results are generally consistent with the results presented in Stevens et al. (1992) for American English. However, in comparison to Stevens et al. (1992), our data showed that voicing decisions of our EP listeners were not equally distributed along the voicing maintenance continuum: The effect was strongest for intermediate voicing maintenance values from 25%–75%, whereas for fully devoiced/voiceless fricatives or fully voiced fricatives (0% and 100% voicing maintenance) a ceiling effect with no influence of fricative duration on the listeners’ ratings was observed. Hence, our data here contradict the linear relationship between voicing maintenance in the stimulus and the listeners’ voicing decisions found by Cho and Giavazzi (2008) for American English. Furthermore, with respect to place of articulation, we found that this effect is stronger for labiodental than for alveolar and postalveolar fricatives. This suggests that due to the more restricted articulatory setting for alveolars and postalveolars (where tongue tip and tongue body are required to be in a very precise position – both horizontally and vertically – in order to generate a suitable frication noise) the labiodental place of articulation has a higher number of degrees of freedom, thus increasing variability for all articulators (except the lips). In the following, we attempt to link speech production and perception of EP fricatives. The aim, apart from the comparability to the study of Stevens et al. (1992), is to obtain a single measure to link speech production and speech perception to examine whether our perceptual findings of the very strong fricative voicing cue are also mirrored in the occurrences of devoicing of EP phonologically voiced fricatives. For this reason, we attempt here to compare the results from the EP production study (described in Section 2.1.2) to the perceptual results (of the first experiment), all in reference to an acoustic landmark we define as voicing offset. We first computed for the production data (the complete EP database, see Section 2.1.2) the absolute voicing offset of all phonologically voiced fricatives separately for each item, i.e., for each fricative production we measured the acoustic landmark where the actual devoicing started. For example, a value of 0ms would be obtained for fully devoiced/voiceless fricatives, and a value of 50ms for fricatives that maintain their voicing up to 50ms following fricative onset, which is consistent with overall percentages of EP fricative devoicing, as described in the Section 2. The results of this analysis, split by place of articulation, are shown in the histograms (voicing offset at the x-axis) in Fig. 5 . We then contrasted this production data with the results of the first perception experiment, again computed with reference to an absolute voicing offset for all stimuli, i.e., the acoustic landmark during fricative duration (VCV) of each stimulus where devoicing occurred in comparison to its overall voicing probability. Fig. 6 shows these results pooled over all stimuli with reference to the absolute voicing offset landmark. When comparing the EP production data (Fig. 5) with the EP perception data (Fig. 6) it can be seen that a high percentage of EP phonologically voiced fricatives has an absolute voicing offset of less than 50ms, thus would be judged as voiceless with reference to the 0.5 voicing probability of the perception experiments results displayed in Fig. 6 (the 0.5 probability point can be extracted at around 50ms, thus voicing durations less than 50ms are perceived as voiceless by the majority of the EP listeners). It has to be noted that around 40% of the EP phonologically voiced fricatives are produced as fully voiced (thus no problem occurs here with reference to listeners’ voicing decisions), and that a large number of EP voiced fricatives has an absolute voicing offset higher than 50ms (again, there would be no problems with listeners’ voicing decisions according to Fig. 6). However, the high percentage of items with absolute voicing offset of less than 50ms in EP is clearly different from the database of Stevens et al. (1992) for American English, where no phonologically voiced fricative voicing lasted for less than 50ms. Thus, an important difference between the two languages occurs for the fricatives here. For EP perception, the high percentage of phonologically voiced fricatives with less than 50ms voicing presents a problem for the perceptual system since, according to Fig. 6, EP listeners should judge all these items as voiceless (see 0.5 probability point in Fig. 6). But since this is not the case, other acoustic cues, most likely fricative duration should be taken into consideration to obtain a robust voicing decision. It would be interesting to further investigate in follow-up experiments what other acoustic cues help in the process to generate a robust voicing decision. 4.2 Perceptual influence of varying pharyngeal width and glottis height Our hypothesis that a variation of pharyngeal width and glottis height would influence voicing distinction for ambiguous duration values was not supported by the results of the second experiment. Thus, it seems that the articulatory differences of pharyngeal width and glottis height observed in MRI images when comparing voiceless and voiced fricatives are due to other reasons (such as aerodynamic requirements), but not deliberately produced to signal and trigger a perceptual contrast. However, the nearly significant results of the glottis height factor could mean that our experimental setting was not precise enough to trigger the perceptual contrast with respect to glottis differences. A follow-up experiment with a different glottis model, other voice qualities or varying F0 might generate significant results. Another possibility is that the effect of glottis height on listener perception is relatively small compared to the strong voicing maintenance cue and thus does not show up in our results. In this case, other perceptual paradigms are necessary to examine the quantitative effect size of glottal height on voicing distinction in fricatives.

Jesus et al.The goal of this study was to analyse perceptually and acoustically the voices of patients with Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis (UVFP) and compare them to the voices of normal subjects. These voices were analysed perceptually with the GRBAS scale and acoustically using the following parameters: mean fundamental frequency (F0), standard-deviation of F0, jitter (ppq5), shimmer (apq11), mean harmonics-To-noise ratio (HNR), mean first (F1) and second (F2) formants frequency, and standard-deviation of F1 and F2 frequencies. Statistically significant differences were found in all of the perceptual parameters. Also the jitter, shimmer, HNR, standard-deviation of F0, and standard-deviation of the frequency of F2 were statistically different between groups, for both genders. In the male data differences were also found in F1 and F2 frequencies values and in the standard-deviation of the frequency of F1. This study allowed the documentation of the alterations resulting from UVFP and addressed the exploration of parameters with limited information for this pathology.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2014 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.Background Event- and interval-based measurements are two different ways of computing frequency of stuttering. Interval-based methodology emerged as an alternative measure to overcome problems associated with reproducibility in the event-based methodology. No review has been made to study the effect of methodological factors in interval-based absolute reliability data or to compute the agreement between the two methodologies in terms of inter-judge, intra-judge and accuracy (i.e., correspondence between raters' scores and an established criterion). Aims To provide a review related to reproducibility of event-based and time-interval measurement, and to verify the effect of methodological factors (training, experience, interval duration, sample presentation order and judgment conditions) on agreement of time-interval measurement; in addition, to determine if it is possible to quantify the agreement between the two methodologies Methods & Procedures The first two authors searched for articles on ERIC, MEDLINE, PubMed, B-on, CENTRAL and Dissertation Abstracts during January-February 2013 and retrieved 495 articles. Forty-eight articles were selected for review. Content tables were constructed with the main findings. Main Contribution Articles related to event-based measurements revealed values of inter- and intra-judge greater than 0.70 and agreement percentages beyond 80%. The articles related to time-interval measures revealed that, in general, judges with more experience with stuttering presented significantly higher levels of intra- and inter-judge agreement. Inter- and intra-judge values were beyond the references for high reproducibility values for both methodologies. Accuracy (regarding the closeness of raters' judgements with an established criterion), intra- and inter-judge agreement were higher for trained groups when compared with non-trained groups. Sample presentation order and audio/video conditions did not result in differences in inter- or intra-judge results. A duration of 5 s for an interval appears to be an acceptable agreement. Explanation for high reproducibility values as well as parameter choice to report those data are discussed. Conclusions & Implications Both interval- and event-based methodologies used trained or experienced judges for inter- and intra-judge determination and data were beyond the references for good reproducibility values. Inter- and intra-judge values were reported in different metric scales among event- and interval-based methods studies, making it unfeasible to quantify the agreement between the two methods.",

A cross-sectional correlational study was undertaken with two hundred and fifty-five (N = 255) individuals from Portuguese general population (mean age 43 years, range 25–84 years; 148 females, 107 males). Participants completed the European Portuguese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life short-form instrument and the European Portuguese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Demographic information was also collected. Portuguese adults reported their QOL as good. The physical, psychological and environmental domains predicted 44 % of the variance of QOL. The strongest predictor was the physical domain and the weakest was social relationships. Age, educational level, socioeconomic status and emotional status were significantly correlated with QOL and explained 25 % of the variance of QOL. The strongest predictor of QOL was emotional status followed by education and age. QOL was significantly different according to: marital status; living place (mainland or islands); type of cohabitants; occupation; health. The sample of adults from general Portuguese population reported high levels of QOL. The life domain that better explained QOL was the physical domain. Among other variables, emotional status best predicted QOL. Further variables influenced overall QOL. These findings inform our understanding on adults from Portuguese general population QOL and can be helpful for researchers and practitioners using this assessment tool to compare their results with normative data.",

Perceptual stimuli were generated using biomechanical modeling. First, a discrimination experiment was conducted to determine the listeners' perceptual sensitivity to the voicing maintenance cue. Second, an identification experiment was conducted to examine the effect and interaction of vowel duration, stop duration, and voicing maintenance during stop closure on the voiced/voiceless identification responses of EP listeners. The results of the discrimination test show that voicing maintenance differences have a significant effect as soon as they exceed a certain threshold. In the identification experiment, evidence was found that only the two factors vowel duration and voicing maintenance significantly influence the listeners' decisions, but not stop duration. The ratio between stop duration and vowel duration plays a major role in distinguishing stop voicing, but only for highly devoiced stimuli. It is shown that in stimuli without a stop burst, both voicing maintenance, as a major but not required cue, and vowel duration are important acoustic cues for stop voicing distinctions in EP.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2014 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.Background The effectiveness of two treatment approaches (phonological therapy and articulation therapy) for treatment of 14 children, aged 4;0-6;7 years, with phonologically based speech-sound disorder (SSD) has been previously analysed with severity outcome measures (percentage of consonants correct score, percentage occurrence of phonological processes and phonetic inventory). Considering that the ultimate goal of intervention for children with phonologically based SSD is to improve intelligibility, it is curious that intervention studies focusing on children's phonology do not routinely use intelligibility as an outcome measure. It is therefore important that the impact of interventions on speech intelligibility is explored. Aims This paper investigates the effectiveness of the two treatment approaches (phonological therapy and articulation therapy) using intelligibility measures, both in single words and in continuous speech, as the primary outcome.Methods & Procedures Fourteen children with phonologically based SSD participated in the intervention. The children were randomly assigned to phonological therapy or articulation therapy (seven children in each group). Two assessment methods were used for measuring intelligibility: a word identification task (for single words) and a rating scale (for continuous speech). Twenty-one unfamiliar adults listened and judged the children's intelligibility. Reliability analyses showed overall high agreement between listeners across both methods.Outcomes & Results Significant improvements were noted in intelligibility in both single words (paired t(6) = 4.409, p = 0.005) and continuous speech (asymptotic Z = 2.371, p = 0.018) for the group receiving phonology therapy pre-to post-treatment, but no differences in intelligibility were found for those receiving the articulation therapy pre-to post-treatment, either for single words (paired t(6) = 1.763, p = 0.128) or continuous speech (asymptotic Z = 1.442, p = 0.149).Conclusions & Implications Intelligibility measures were sensitive enough to show changes in the phonological therapy group but not in the articulation therapy group. These findings emphasize the importance of using intelligibility as an outcome measure to complement the results obtained with other severity measures when exploring the effectiveness of speech interventions. This study presents new evidence for the effectiveness of phonological therapy in improving intelligibility with children with SSD.",

Methods: The Modified A-Space method was used to select 4 speakers (1 male and 1 female class I, 1 male and 1 female class II). Articulatory and acoustic features of the vowels were studied using different tasks and methods. The articulatory and acoustic features of consonants in male and female speakers of class I and class II from the XRMB-SPD were also described in detail. Measures extracted from multitaper spectra and articulatory data were used, to observe individual differences related with gender and dental occlusion. Results: Results showed some structural differences related to occlusal class and variance in class II subjects' structures and articulatory adaptations. However, subjects showed a high adaptation capacity, being able to adjust their articulations to produce all vowels. Conclusions: Speech production variability is related with orofacial structures' variance. Different structures produce various functional adaptations and distinct speech signals.",

All rights reserved.The overall goal of the paper is to contribute to a better understanding of segment-prosody interaction in different speech modes. In particular, the paper shows that depending on intonation patterns, utterance-final voiceless fricatives in Polish show different properties. In polar questions with rising intonation, the frequency of the highest spectral peak is higher than in statements produced with falling intonation. Voiceless fricatives in questions display higher Centre of Gravity accompanied by higher standard deviation. Furthermore, the fricatives are produced with higher mean intensities in questions than statements. Differences in fricatives are more pronounced when the sentences are whispered. For instance, in contrast to normal speech where skewness and kurtosis do not show differences, in whispered speech both spectral moments display lower values in statements than in questions. In addition, spectral slopes (m1, m2) are steeper in questions than in statements. In summary, the paper shows that voiceless fricatives are prone to intonation differences and follow its patterns by means of varying spectral cues inherent to these sounds.",

        "doc_abstract": "This paper examines acoustic correlates of intonation in Polish whispered, semi-whispered and normal speech modes. In particular, it investigates correlates of utterance-final rising intonation in polar questions and falling intonation in statements. The paper examines not only properties of vowels but also properties of the following voiceless consonant clusters. The study is based on measurements of 4608 sibilants (fricatives and affricates) produced by 16 native speakers of Polish. The results point to differences in spectral properties of both utterance-final vowels and consonants where falling intonation in statements contrasts with rising intonation in polar questions. Regarding the consonants, both fricatives and affricates are produced with higher spectral peaks, higher intensity and higher COG and STD values in questions than in statements. Skewness and kurtosis values are lower in questions than in statements. Some spectral differences of sibilants, including spectral slopes, are more distinguishable for questions versus statements in the whispered speech mode than in other speech modes. The more pronounced role of these cues in whispered speech suggests their compensatory function for the fundamental frequency, which is the main correlate of intonation in phonated speech but is completely absent in whispered speech. In summary, the study shows that speakers produce intended intonation patterns by varying the choice of cues as well as their magnitude in dependence on both (i) speech modes and (ii) intonation patterns.",

        "doc_abstract": "Speech production and speech perception studies were conducted to compare (de)voicing in the Romance languages European Portuguese (EP) and Italian. For the speech production part, velar stops in two positions and four vowel contexts were recorded. The voicing status for 10 consecutive landmarks during stop closure was computed. Results showed that during the complete stop closure voicing was always maintained for Italian, and that for EP, there was strong devoicing for all vowel contexts and positions. Both language and vowel context had a significant effect on voicing during stop closure. The duration values and voicing patterns from the production study were then used as input factors to a follow-up perceptual experiment to test the effects of vowel duration, stop duration and voicing maintenance on voicing perception by EP and Italian listeners. Perceptual stimuli (VCV) were generated using biomechanical modelling so that they would include physically realistic transitions between phonemes. The consonants were velar stops, with no burst or noise included in the signal. A strong language dependency of the three factors on listeners' voicing distinction was found, with high sensitivity for all three cues for EP listeners and low sensitivity for Italian listeners. For EP stimuli with high voicing maintenance during stop closure, this cue was very strong and overrode the other two acoustic cues. However, for stimuli with low voicing maintenance (i.e. highly devoiced stimuli), the acoustic cues vowel duration and stop duration take over. Even in the absence of both voicing maintenance during stop closure and a burst, the acoustic cues vowel duration and stop duration guaranteed stable voicing distinction in EP. Italian listeners were insensitive to all three acoustic cues examined in this study, with stable voiced responses throughout all of the varying fully crossed factors. None of the examined acoustic cues appeared to be used by Italian listeners to obtain a robust voicing distinction, thus pointing to the use of other acoustic cues or combination of other cues to guarantee stable voicing distinction in this language. © 2014 Pape and Jesus; licensee Springer.",

        "doc_abstract": "Background: Addressing the long-term consequences of stroke is a top 10 research priority, and understanding the views of different stakeholders is essential in designing appropriate patient-centred multidisciplinary rehabilitation.Aims: This study reports on the perspectives of 38 individuals who live with or work with aphasia: people with aphasia (PWA), family members (FM) and friends, and speech and language therapists (SLTs), about its consequences in the daily lives of PWA.Method & Resources: In total, 14 PWA, 14 FM and 10 SLTs participated in the study. All participants were interviewed about the consequences of stroke and aphasia. Small focus groups were used with some participants. In-depth semi-structured interviews were used with other participants. Interviews were carried out in groups or individually in order to accommodate severe aphasic impairments or respondents with fewer years of education. Interviews were video or audio-recorded. Verbal and non-verbal communication was transcribed and analysed qualitatively using content analysis. Data was coded and mapped onto the ICF framework.Outcomes & Results: All three groups reported consequences in Body Functions and Body Structures, primarily in Mental Functions (Specific Mental Functions and Global Mental Functions) and Neuromusculoskeletal and Movement-Related Functions. Within Specific Mental Functions, PWA emphasised Expression of Oral Language, whereas FM and SLTs emphasised Emotional Functions. Within Global Mental Functions, PWA and FM emphasised Energy and Drive Functions, whereas SLTs emphasised Temperament and Personality Functions. Some consequences were shared between PWA and SLTs (Sensory Functions and Pain, and Functions of the Digestive, Metabolic and Endocrine Systems), whilst others were specific to SLTs alone (Voice and Speech Functions, and Cardiovascular, Haematological, Immunological and Respiratory Systems). All three groups reported consequences in Activities and Participation in Major Life Areas; Community, Social and Civic Life; Interpersonal Interactions and Relationships; Communication; and Mobility. Some consequences were shared by PWA and FM (Domestic Life), and others by FM and SLT (Self Care). Consequences in General Tasks and Demands were only described by SLTs and in Learning and Applying Knowledge by PWA. Both PWA and FM reported a general Loss of Autonomy.Conclusions: PWA, FM and SLTs reported a considerable range of stroke and aphasia consequences in the daily life of those who live with it. They were concerned to different degrees with language, physical and emotional changes, and impact on communication, mobility, self-care, relationships, leisure and work. Professionals' practices in Portugal need to be changed in order to consider these findings. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",

        "doc_abstract": "Background In Portugal, the routine clinical practice of speech and language therapists (SLTs) in treating children with all types of speech sound disorder (SSD) continues to be articulation therapy (AT). There is limited use of phonological therapy (PT) or phonological awareness training in Portugal. Additionally, at an international level there is a focus on collecting information on and differentiating between the effectiveness of PT and AT for children with different types of phonologically based SSD, as well as on the role of phonological awareness in remediating SSD. It is important to collect more evidence for the most effective and efficient type of intervention approach for different SSDs and for these data to be collected from diverse linguistic and cultural perspectives. Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a PT and AT approach for treatment of 14 Portuguese children, aged 4.0-6.7 years, with a phonologically based SSD. Methods & Procedures The children were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment approaches (seven children in each group). All children were treated by the same SLT, blind to the aims of the study, over three blocks of a total of 25 weekly sessions of intervention. Outcome measures of phonological ability (percentage of consonants correct (PCC), percentage occurrence of different phonological processes and phonetic inventory) were taken before and after intervention. A qualitative assessment of intervention effectiveness from the perspective of the parents of participants was included. Outcomes & Results Both treatments were effective in improving the participants' speech, with the children receiving PT showing a more significant improvement in PCC score than those receiving the AT. Children in the PT group also showed greater generalization to untreated words than those receiving AT. Parents reported both intervention approaches to be as effective in improving their children's speech. Conclusions & Implications The PT (combination of expressive phonological tasks, phonological awareness, listening and discrimination activities) proved to be an effective integrated method of improving phonological SSD in children. These findings provide some evidence for Portuguese SLTs to employ PT with children with phonologically based SSD. © 2012 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.",

We analysed the spectral peaks and troughs by means of multitaper spectra and performed a parameterisation of the stop spectra using slope and moment measures. In comparison to traditional spectral estimations, multitaper is more exact and, more importantly, not limited to a stationary signal length necessary for the analysis window. Therefore, it is well-suited for the rather short duration of the burst of a stop. Results show that the burst characteristics vary with place of articulation. While the global spectral frequencies match the data in classical literature, it is shown that other spectral measures in our data do not follow the typical classical spectral patterns. It is discussed whether these differences are due to the use of different methodology, or substantial cross-linguistic differences in the spectral characteristics.",

        "doc_abstract": "Understanding of the production mechanisms of voiced fricatives lags significantly behind that of other phonemic categories of speech. This paper presents a new voicing classification criterion to distinguish the voicing in fricatives from that of their contextual vowels in VCV tokens: weak vs strong voicing. The criterion is based on the oral airflow, distinguishing it from previous criteria based jointly on the acoustic and EGG signals. Aerodynamic and EGG recordings of four normal adult speakers (two females and two males), producing a speech corpus of 9 isolated words with the European Portuguese (EP) voiced fricatives /v, z, ̂/ in word-initial, -medial and -final position, and the same 9 words embedded in 42 different real EP carrier sentences, were analysed. Fricatives were characterised in terms of oral airflow, fundamental frequency, first formant intensity level and glottal open quotient in absolute terms and relative to the values found in their surrounding vowels. The voicing during fricative production presented properties distinct from the voicing of the contextual vowels, leading to the development of a classification criterion based on the relative amplitude of the oscillations in the oral airflow signal. This contributes to distinguish voicing in fricatives from the modal voicing of the vowels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Understanding of the production mechanisms of voiced fricatives lags significantly behind that of other phonemic categories of speech. This paper presents a new voicing classification criterion to distinguish the voicing in fricatives from that of their contextual vowels in VCV tokens: weak vs strong voicing. The criterion is based on the oral airflow, distinguishing it from previous criteria based jointly on the acoustic and EGG signals. Aerodynamic and EGG recordings of four normal adult speakers (two females and two males), producing a speech corpus of 9 isolated words with the European Portuguese (EP) voiced fricatives /v, z, ʒ/ in word-initial, -medial and -final position, and the same 9 words embedded in 42 different real EP carrier sentences, were analysed. Fricatives were characterised in terms of oral airflow, fundamental frequency, first formant intensity level and glottal open quotient in absolute terms and relative to the values found in their surrounding vowels. The voicing during fricative production presented properties distinct from the voicing of the contextual vowels, leading to the development of a classification criterion based on the relative amplitude of the oscillations in the oral airflow signal. This contributes to distinguish voicing in fricatives from the modal voicing of the vowels. Highlights ► New criterion to distinguish voicing in fricatives from that of contextual vowels in VCV tokens. ► Criterion based on oral airflow oscillation amplitude alone. ► Voicing mode in fricatives has properties distinct from the voicing of the contextual vowels. ► Oral airflow oscillation amplitude reduces on average by 70% between vowels and fricative. 1 Introduction It is well known that voiced fricatives are less frequent than other classes of speech sounds in the world's languages (Ohala & Solé, 2010; Solé, 2010), but the reason why is still an open problem (Shadle, 2010). The multiple aerodynamic, articulatory and acoustic interactions that govern the production principles involved are not as well understood as for their voiceless counterparts (Shadle, 2010). The phonetic realisation of voicing in different languages is highly variable, and most definitions of voicing are based on properties of the acoustic signal and use articulatory terms (Möbius, 2004, p. 5). Despite the fundamental interaction of voicing mechanisms with airflow, the differences in aerodynamic behaviour (Barney, Jesus, & Santos, 2008) have not been used, to our knowledge, to investigate voicing in vowel–fricative–vowel (VFV) productions. Stevens (1991) indicates that maintenance of voicing in fricatives can be problematic as the constriction required to produce frication noise acts to reduce the trans-glottal pressure drop. A strong noise source can only be achieved during fricative production at the expense of voice efficiency. If strong voicing is to be maintained, the amplitude of the noise source becomes small. Smith (1997) and Pirello, Blumstein, and Kurowski (1997) observed high percentages of devoicing for American English fricatives. Jesus and Shadle (2002, 2003) showed that the devoicing rate was very high for European Portuguese (EP) fricatives, especially when compared with studies of other languages, and that devoicing occurred more often in word-final than word-initial position. Both the acoustic signal and the electroglottograph (EGG) signal have been used in the past (Jesus & Shadle, 2002) to determine manually whether a fricative was devoiced. In a study of devoicing of EP fricatives, Jesus and Shadle (2003) used a criterion based on the ratio of variances of the EGG signal during the vowel–fricative (VF) transition and during the fricative to classify the examples into two categories (voiced/devoiced). Jesus and Jackson (2008) recently proposed, based on the acoustic signal, an automatic method for phonetic analysis of the durational characteristics of voicing and frication features in EP and British English. The final output was an objective annotation of voiced and unvoiced frication to 1ms resolution, from which duration statistics were obtained. The oral airflow, however, being more closely related to the laryngeal mechanisms of voice production (in contrast to the more perceptually related acoustic output of the vocal tract) may offer new insight into the maintenance or cessation of voicing under different phonological conditions. We therefore wished to explore the differences that might occur from phone to phone in the oral airflow during the production of fricatives in inter-vocalic contexts. Our previous work (Pinho, Jesus, & Barney, 2009) suggested that measurements of this kind might lead, in the longer term, to a more in-depth understanding of the conditions required for the maintenance or cessation of glottal vibrations during voiced fricative production. Accordingly, we report here the outcomes of Rothenberg (1973) mask recordings, a device which provides a well-established and straightforward means to measure the oral airflow, together with recordings of laryngeal activity from an EGG signal. Our goal was to establish systematically the airflow characteristics under different phonetic conditions of voiced fricative production relative to those of a preceding and following contextual vowel. Specifically, we considered absolute values of oral airflow oscillation amplitude, fundamental frequency, first formant intensity level and glottal open quotient. In addition to using a different measurement regime to previous studies, we asked our subjects to produce real EP words and phrases for our data collection. The main motivation for using real words in a rich variety of contexts (resulting in multiple within word and crossword interaction effects), was evidence from the literature (Fitch, 1990; Higgins, Netsell, & Schulte, 1994; Netsell, Lotz, & Shaughnessy, 1984) that “more natural speaking tasks … might reveal subtle speech production mechanisms … because of the different physiological demands placed upon the phonatory mechanism” (Higgins, et al., 1994, p. 38). Fitch (1990) has shown that natural speaking tasks result in less between-trial variability than other speech. Further, Higgins et al. (1994, p. 39) suggest that “Speaking tasks that result in minimal normal variability while still approximating the dynamics of normal speech production would be the most desirable…”. The next section of this paper describes in detail our data collection methods, the corpus used to elicit speech from our subjects and the analysis methods we adopted for the oral airflow and EGG signals. We then report the results of our measurements and analyse them in terms of the changes in parameters between phones in VCV sequences with a statistical analysis to identify significant differences. We also report on the suitability of classical measures of devoicing defined for the acoustic signal and adapted here for application to the oral airflow. Finally, we identify a mode of voicing, weak voicing, prevalent during voiced fricatives, that differs from the more modal voicing found during the contextual vowels and define a threshold value for the relative amplitude of the oral airflow oscillations between the fricative and its surrounding vowels which is characteristic of this voicing mode. 2 Data collection and analysis 2.1 Subjects Data were collected from two adult female (JG and HV) and two adult male (LJ and RS) speakers of EP with an age range of 20–39 years. None of the subjects had reported speech, language or hearing disorders. They were assessed by an experienced Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) using a standardised evaluation protocol (Jesus et al., 2009) and all were found to have phonatory behaviour that lay within normal parameters. 2.2 Corpus The corpus was designed so that a large number of real EP sentences (grammatically possible and appropriate) was used as the basis for the analysis. Speakers were recorded producing 51 utterances: – 9 isolated words containing the EP voiced fricatives /v, z, ʒ/ in word-initial, word-medial and word-final positions; – the same 9 words embedded in 42 different carrier sentences of the form: “Diga X Y por favor”. Here X is one of the 9 words and Y was a segment starting with a word that had an initial phone chosen to represent one of the possible consonantal (taps, laterals, stops and nasals) or vocalic (close, open front and back vowels) real EP contexts (see Appendix A for details of the words and carrier sentences used). The 9 isolated words containing the EP voiced fricatives /v, z, ʒ/ in word-initial, word-medial and word-final positions, included vocalic contexts representing the different vowel heights used in EP: open, open-mid, close-mid and close. The carrier phrases represented a change from the carrier sentence “Diga X por favor” used by Jesus and Shadle (2002) and Lousada, Jesus, and Hall (2010). The Y segment started with a word with an initial phoneme chosen to represent one of the possible consonantal (taps, laterals, stops and nasals) and vocalic real EP contexts (X was one of the 9 words). The vowels in the initial syllable of the first word in the Y segments were divided into two groups according to their height: group 1—/i, ɨ, u, e, o/; group 2—/ɛ, ɔ, ɐ, a/. A rich variety of phonetic contexts using real EP words was selected to study the most relevant phoneme variants (Jesus & Shadle, 2002), and fully describe the aerodynamic properties of EP fricatives. Words were chosen and sentences were built following language-specific phonological rules (Jesus & Shadle, 2002), for example: vowels /ɐ/ and /u/ can occur in the tonic syllable; vowels /ɐ/, /ɨ/ and /u/ can occur before and after the tonic syllable; the fricatives /v, z, ʒ/ can all occur in initial and medial positions; /ʒ/ is the only fricative that can occur in word-final position. Phonetically, any fricative can be found in word final position as a consequence of deletion of unstressed vowels (Jesus & Shadle, 2002). The corpus was designed to include word and crossword contexts that might elicit devoicing (or help maintain voicing) in fricatives. The following phonological environments were used. – Environment 1 (files 001–009—9 tokens): A baseline is established by producing the nine (9) words without a frame sentence. The fricatives are better controlled and easier to analyse than those occurring in frame sentences. – Environment 2 (files 019–030—12 tokens): Words with fricatives in final position are produced in a frame sentence where the word that follows the fricative has the following initial phonemic context: Vowel from group 2 (/ɛ, ɔ, ɐ, a/) followed by a lateral (019, 023 and 027) and a tap (020, 024 and 028); Vowel from group 1 (/i, ɨ, u, e, o/) followed by a lateral (021, 025 and 029) and a tap (022, 026 and 030). – Environment 3 (files 031–039—9 tokens): The nine (9) words with fricatives are embedded in the frame sentences “Diga X por favor” previously used by Jesus and Shadle (2002) and Lousada et al. (2010) to facilitate comparisons. – Environment 4 (files 040–048—9 tokens): Words with fricatives in final position are produced in a frame sentence where the word that follows the fricative has the following initial phonemic context: Voiced velar stop (040, 043 and 046); Vowel from group 1 (/i, ɨ, u, e, o/) followed by voiced velar stop (041, 044 and 047); Vowel from group 2 (/ɛ, ɔ, ɐ, a/) followed by voiced velar stop (042, 045 and 048). – Environment 5 (files 049–054—6 tokens): Words with fricatives in final position are produced in a frame sentence where the word that follows the fricative has one of the following initial phonemic contexts: Vowel from group 2 (/ɛ, ɔ, ɐ, a/) followed by nasal stop (049, 051 and 053); Vowel from group 1 (/i, ɨ, u, e, o/) followed by nasal stop (050, 052 and 054). – Environment 6 (files 055–060—6 tokens): Words with fricatives in final position are produced in a frame sentence where the word that follows the fricative has one of the following initial phonemic contexts: Vowel from group 2 (/ɛ, ɔ, ɐ, a/) followed by voiced postalveolar fricative (055, 057 and 059); Vowel from group 1 (/i, ɨ, u, e, o/) followed by voiced postalveolar fricative (056, 058 and 060). A number of different factors have been reported in the literature as having an influence in the maintenance of voicing. These have determined our choice of word and sentence contexts, namely: Place of articulation—voicing may cease earlier for more posterior places of articulation (Jesus & Shadle, 2002; Keating, Linker, & Huffman, 1983; Ohala & Riordan, 1979). Word-position—Westbury and Keating (1985) showed that from an aerodynamic point of view a voiced obstruent is more likely to be produced in medial position, whereas in utterance initial and final position it is more probable to produce devoiced items. Consonant duration—Ohala and Sprouse (2003) showed in a vented valve experiment that it was difficult to maintain voicing for longer than around 60ms, i.e., the longer the consonant duration, the more probable that voicing ceases. Context—For English, Ohala and Riordan (1979) observed that obstruents coarticulated with high vowels maintained voicing longer than when coarticulated with low vowels. They explained the results by the enlarged pharyngeal cavity for high vowels. For German, Pape, Mooshammer, Hoole, and Fuchs (2006) confirmed this vowel-dependency, with a higher obstruent devoicing percentage when followed by any low vowel. This result was obtained even when the vowel-stop cluster spanned a word boundary. However, despite the reported vowel-dependent results regarding obstruent voicing for other languages, this has not been observed in previous studies for EP fricatives. Jesus and Shadle (2002) found that “…there seems to be no particular vowel context that is primarily associated with devoicing…” and further that “…devoicing occurs more often in word-final than word-initial position, but is unrelated to a particular vowel context…” Pape and Jesus (2011) analysed the effect of the height of the following vowel on devoicing and found no difference for three of the four speakers in their study. Although the evidence from Ohala and Riordan (1979) suggests that stops coarticulated with high vowels are less likely to devoice than stops coarticulated with non-high vowels, Ohala (1983) reviewed additional experimental evidence related to voicing in stops and did not find “…much support for this in the phonological literature.” (Ohala, 1983, p. 198). Ohde's (1984) analysis based on acoustic signals is one of the very few pieces of work that revealed a significant effect of vowels on the change of f0 from the first to the second glottal periods following VOT of American English stops. However, the degree of articulatory constraint (DAC) model of speech production predicts that fricatives /z, ʒ/ (that we focus on this study) are resistant to coarticulation effects (Recasens & Espinosa, 2009). 2.3 Recordings Recordings were made in a quiet room (ABS-AUD.45.1, Absorsor, Portugal; 45dB sound reduction) using a Rothenberg mask (Rothenberg, 1973) and a PTW-1 pressure transducer (Glottal Enterprises, USA) for measuring the airflow at the mouth. An EGG signal was also collected using an EGG processor (model EG2-PCX, Glottal Enterprises, USA). The oral airflow and EGG signals were recorded with a MS-110 electronics unit (Glottal Enterprises, USA), connected via an external sound card to a laptop computer running WaveviewPro Version 2.2.6 (16 bits, 44.1kHz sampling frequency). Airflow calibration and zero-setting of signals were undertaken before each recording session using a Glottal Enterprises FC-1 airflow calibrator and WaveviewPro Version 2.2.6 standard procedures. Speakers were asked to read the words and phrases from a cue card placed in front of them with normal effort and as close as possible to their natural speech. Speakers spent a short time acclimatising to speaking wearing the mask prior to recording. 2.4 Corpus annotation The time waveforms of all the corpus words were manually annotated using Praat Version 5.0.43 (Boersma, 2001) to detect the start of phone 1 (the vowel or silence preceding the fricative), the start and end of the fricative (phone 2) and the end of phone 3 (the vowel or silence following the fricative). Manual annotation was used to guarantee a consistent segmentation, between utterances and subjects as recommended by Jesus and Shadle (2002, p. 442). The start of phone 1 (preceding the fricative) was defined by the presence of periodicity in the airflow waveform (see Fig. 1) and checked against the spectrogram for the visible presence of F2. The start of phone 2 (the fricative) was considered to occur when there was a simultaneous decrease in airflow amplitude (see Fig. 1), a cessation of voicing (for devoiced cases) and an onset of frication noise. For phone 3 the start was defined as the point where one or all of the following criteria was satisfied: frication noise ceased; voicing restarted (for devoiced or partially devoiced phone 2); there was an increase in oral airflow amplitude (see Fig. 1). The end of phone 3 was established by listening to the time-derivative of the airflow and checking the spectrogram for the presence of F2. For each metric discussed below average values were calculated from 20ms windows centred within phones 1, 2 and 3 (see Fig. 1). We chose a window duration of 20ms based on previous work by Stevens, Blumstein, Glicksman, Burton, and Kurowski (1992) and Pirello et al. (1997). Both these studies suggest that in any fricative perceived as voiced there will be a minimum of 20ms where periodicity can be detected in the acoustic speech signal. In vowels this corresponds approximately to a steady state portion of the utterance. In the fricatives the signal is not always stationary during this analysis window but it represents, nevertheless, a portion of the phone which excludes the phonemic transition regions. 2.5 Absolute measures Oral airflow (OA—cm 3 /s): The mean value of the amplitude of the oscillations in the oral airflow over the analysis window was extracted for phones 1, 2 and 3 from all the recordings and for every speaker. Matlab scripts were used to extract the peaks and troughs of the signal cycle-by-cycle. The mean amplitude of the oral airflow fluctuations within each analysis window was obtained by averaging the cycle-by-cycle values. We describe this measure as the absolute oral airflow (OA). Fundamental frequency (f0—Hz): Absolute mean fundamental frequency was calculated for the analysis windows of the three phones from all the recordings and for every speaker using the Praat Version 5.0.43 autocorrelation method with the following parameters: 0s time step; 75Hz pitch floor; 600Hz pitch ceiling. First formant intensity level (IF1—dB/Hz): The amplitude and decay rate of the oscillatory patterns in the oral airflow are related to the amplitude and broadness of the corresponding formant peaks in the spectrum of the acoustic speech signal (Hertegard & Gauffin, 1995). We therefore refer, in this study, to the first spectral peak extracted from the oral airflow as the first formant (F1) and use an extraction method designed for use with the acoustic signal. A Praat Version 5.0.43 split Levinson algorithm was applied to the oral airflow signal to extract the absolute first formant frequency track (F1) sampled over the analysis windows for each phone with the following parameters: time step of 25% of analysis window length; maximum number of formants 5; maximum formant frequency 5500Hz; 0.025s analysis window length; 50Hz pre-emphasis. This gave an estimate of F1 at each sampling point. Next, a spectrogram was generated from the raw oral airflow and the power spectral density (PSD) (cm6 s−2/Hz) was extracted at the F1 frequency corresponding to each sampling point. The parameters for the spectrogram were: 0.005s window length; maximum frequency 5000Hz; 0.002s time step; 20Hz frequency step; Gaussian window shape. The mean F1 intensity for the window was calculated by averaging over all PSD estimates. The mean F1 intensity level (IF1) is the mean F1 intensity expressed in dB. Open quotient (OQ—%): the open quotient, a parameter used to characterise the nature of the quasiperiodic vocal fold vibrations, is defined as the ratio of the duration of the glottal open phase to that of the fundamental period. OQ changes can be correlated to physiological constraints in different phonation types (Bouzid & Ellouze, 2007). The mean open quotient over the analysis windows for each phone was extracted from the EGG signal using custom Matlab scripts based on the open source software MOQ interface (Henrich, 2007). The method DEGG DECOM, based on the raw and differentiated EGG (DEGG) signals was used to estimate f0 and OQ. Henrich, Alessandro, Doval, and Castellengo (2004) reported that this method was an improvement on those proposed by Rothenberg and Mahshie (1988) and Howard (1995). For each phone we extracted every valid OQ value to obtain the average OQ over the analysis window. In cases where the peaks in the DEGG do not stand out clearly and the OQ cannot be calculated reliably, it does not make sense to talk of an OQ at all (Henrich, 2007). Taking this into account, zero and nonsense OQ values (e.g., corresponding to f0 values greater than 400Hz) were not considered. To be consistent we did not make an OQ analysis when phone 1 or phone 3 was silence. 2.6 Relative measures There is compelling evidence (Ladefoged, 2005; Ladefoged & Johnson, 2011; Lahiri, Gewirth, & Blumstein, 1984) that absolute values are not linguistically relevant and that they only “convey information about the speaker's age, sex, emotional state, and attitude toward the topic under discussion” (Ladefoged & Johnson, 2011, p. 24). Ladefoged (2005) hypothesises that the goals of speech production are to achieve certain aerodynamic targets and shows that the phonetic property stress is correlated to relative (to adjacent syllables) respiratory energy. For bilabial and dental/alveolar stops it has long been known (Lahiri et al., 1984) that they may be differentiated effectively by time varying and relative acoustic properties. We therefore consider here not only the absolute values of the parameters defined in Section 2.5 but also their relative values between phones. For each metric described above (OA, f0, IF1 and OQ) a relative measure between phones 1 and 2 (phone (1–2)%) and between phones 2 and 3 (phone (2–3)%) was calculated using (Pinho et al., 2009) (1) P h o n e ( 1 − 2 ) ( % ) = [ M e a n ( P h o n e 1 ) W 20 ms − M e a n ( P h o n e 2 ) W 20 ms ] ⁎ 100 M e a n ( P h o n e 1 ) W 20 ms (2) P h o n e ( 2 − 3 ) ( % ) = [ M e a n ( P h o n e 3 ) W 20 ms − M e a n ( P h o n e 2 ) W 20 ms ] ⁎ 100 M e a n ( P h o n e 3 ) W 20 ms 2.7 Analyses Voicing classification: A classification of the voicing category of fricatives was proposed by Jesus and Shadle (2002) and has been adapted for this study. They used an acoustic speech signal, recorded with a microphone located 1m in front of the subject's mouth and an EGG signal. A study by Pirello et al. (1997) used an alternative measure of presence or absence of voicing based on the acoustic signal: when there was a difference in amplitude greater than 10dB between a fricative and its preceding vowel it was classified as devoiced. It was not evident a priori, however, whether the same threshold value would be suitable for use with the oral airflow. In this study we used the durations proposed by Jesus and Shadle (2002) for voicing classification but applied them to the oral airflow and EGG signals. Their criteria, adapted to our study, may be summarised as follows. A fricative was called: – devoiced when less than one-third of the frication interval showed periodic structure; – partially devoiced when more than one-third but less than half of the frication interval contained steady periodic cycles; – voiced when more than half of the frication interval showed steady periodic cycles, even if the amplitude was much lower than in the vowel. This classification was automatically extracted with a Praat Version 5.0.43 script developed for this purpose. When the EGG and oral airflow-based estimates disagreed (a minority of cases), a visual inspection of the signals was performed. Most of these disagreements happened for signals where the proportion of voicing was close to the category margin. In all cases of disagreement the oral airflow-based estimate was given precedence. Analysis-of-variance (ANOVA): Repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between mean metrics for phones 1, 2 and 3 at the 95% level. Factors were subject (4 levels, random effect), phone (3 levels, repeated measure) and fricative ID (3 levels, repeated measure). The dependent variable was one of OA, f0, IF1 and OQ. The repeated measures design was required because mean values of a given metric for phones 1, 2 and 3 for a given subject and fricative may not be independent. The ANOVA was implemented using the algorithm RMAOV2 written in Matlab (Trujillo-Ortiz, Hernandez-Walls, & Trujillo-Perez, 2004). In the case of each of the dependent variables, analysis of the data sets did not support an assumption of sphericity according to Mauchly's test (Mauchly, 1940; Trujillo-Ortiz & Hernandez-Walls, 2003) so prior to significance testing the number of degrees of freedom for each factor was adjusted using the Huynh–Feldt epsilon (Huynh, 1978; Trujillo-Ortiz, 2006). 3 Results 3.1 Voicing classification A classification of the voicing category of fricatives produced by the four speakers, was made using an adapted version of the criteria (see Section 2.7) proposed by Jesus and Shadle (2002). Only 21% (/v/ 7%; /z/ 11%; /ʒ/ 3%) of recorded fricatives were classified as devoiced or partially devoiced (see Table 1). This is a much lower percentage of tokens classified as devoiced and partially devoiced than was reported in Jesus and Shadle (2002) for their corpus (/v/ 61%; /z/ 89%; /ʒ/ 91%). However, as described above, they based their classification on the acoustic speech signal and the EGG signal, whereas we used the oral airflow and EGG. Our data suggests that when a voicing decision is based on the oral airflow, the large majority of fricative tokens will be classified as voiced. 3.2 Oral airflow waveforms Figs. 2–4 show the oral airflow waveforms across phones 1, 2, and 3 for male speaker LJ. We observed that the oral airflow during phone 2 (the fricative) had a lower oscillation amplitude than during the preceding and following phones (when these were voiced). Further, during the fricative the harmonic complexity of the signal was reduced, in particular the formant excitation, frequently visible in the surrounding vowels, was rarely visible in the fricative. Measurements for other subjects showed the same overall patterns of reduced oscillation amplitude and harmonic complexity of the oral airflow in phone 2 compared to phones 1 and 3 although the fine details of the voicing pattern for different utterances often differed substantially between subjects. 3.3 Absolute oral airflow The values for the mean absolute oral airflow and its standard deviation are shown in Table 2 for each of the 4 subjects. The absolute values for the oscillation amplitude varied widely between subjects, although the general pattern of reduced oral airflow oscillation amplitude during phone 2 was common to all subjects. An analysis-of-variance, as described in Section 2.7, was used to investigate the statistical significance of differences between the mean absolute oral airflow values in phones 1, 2 and 3. There was a significant difference in the mean absolute oral airflow measured between phones 1, 2, and 3 after accounting for the differences between subjects (F(2,6)=23.251, p=0.02). Post hoc testing based on the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the means showed that for subjects LJ, RS and HV phones 1 and 2 have significantly different mean oral airflow, phones 2 and 3 have significantly different mean oral airflow and phones 1 and 3 have significantly different mean oral airflow. For subject JG the contrast between phones 1 and 3 was not significant for the mean oral airflow. There was no significant difference in mean oral airflow for the factor fricative ID once differences due to the subjects had been accounted for (F(2,6)=1.445, p=0.32). For the interaction effect fricative ID vs. phone, the overall contribution to the variance was not significant at the 95% level (F(4,12)=0.365, p=0.83) indicating that the significant main effect found for phone was not modified by the choice of fricative. 3.4 Absolute fundamental frequency (f0) The raw data for the estimates of f0 from the oral airflow show the expected, gender-related differences in mean f0. The mean absolute f0 estimated from the oral airflow for each subject and its standard deviation is shown in Table 3. The mean fundamental frequency derived for phone 2 was lower than for either phone 1 or phone 3 although each subject had a minority of cases where f0 stayed the same or increased during phone 2. An analysis of variance, as described in Section 2.7, was used to investigate the statistical significance of differences between the mean f0 values in phones 1, 2 and 3. There was a significant difference in the mean f0 measured between phones 1, 2, and 3 after accounting for the differences between subjects (F(2,6)=31.118, p≤0.001). Post hoc testing based on the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the means shows that for subjects LJ and HV there were significant differences in mean f0 between phones 1 and 2 and between phones 2 and 3 but not between phones 1 and 3. Subject RS had no significant differences in mean f0 between any phone pairs and subject JG had a significant difference between phones 1 and 2 only. Note that despite gender difference, LJ and HV had similar f0 strategies across the phones, although their absolute values were different. There was no significant difference in f0 for the factor fricative ID once differences due to the subjects had been accounted for (F(2,6)=2.443, p=0.17). For the interaction effect fricative ID vs. phone, the overall contribution to the variance was significant (F(4,12)=3.792, p=0.03). The significant main effect found for phone was qualified according to the choice of fricative. After subject differences were accounted for, contrasts based on the 95% confidence interval of difference in the mean values showed that for each of /v/, /z/ and /ʒ/ phones 1 and 2 were significantly different, phones 2 and 3 were also significantly different, but phones 1 and 3 were not significantly different. 3.5 Absolute IF1 intensity The pattern of variation of IF1 between phones 1, 2 and 3 was much more diverse and frequently F1 could not be estimated from the phone 2 analysis window. Only subject RS produced measurable F1 values for the majority of phone 2 tokens. For the other subjects and in particular the female ones, F1 for phone 2 was substantially reduced or absent for a majority of measured utterances. Table 4 shows the mean and standard deviation of IF1, where they were measurable, for each subject. The symbol “–” (in Table 4) for JG's phone 2 fricative /z/ indicates that this subject produced no measurable F1 in any production of this fricative. An analysis of variance, as described in Section 2.7, was used to investigate the statistical significance of differences between the mean IF1 values in phones 1, 2 and 3. There was an overall significant difference in the mean IF1 measured between phones 1, 2, and 3 after accounting for the differences between subjects (F(2,6)=49.354, p=0.004). Post hoc testing based on the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the means shows that for all subjects, phones 1 and 2 had significantly different mean IF1 as did phones 2 and 3. Phones 1 and 3, however, did not have significantly different IF1. To clarify this finding, the IF1 of the fricative, when measurable, always differs significantly from that of the surrounding phones, however in the majority of tokens IF1 was not measurable. There was no significant difference in IF1 for the factor fricative ID once differences due to the subjects had been accounted for (F(2,6)=1.028, p=0.43). For the interaction effect fricative vs. phone, the overall contribution to the variance was not significant at the 95% level (F(4,12)=2.041, p=0.15) indicating that the significant main effect found for phone was not modified by the choice of fricative. 3.6 Open quotient (OQ) Mean OQ values over the data analysis windows extracted from the EGG data are shown in Table 5 with their standard deviations. Only data from those cycles of the EGG where a valid OQ could be extracted by the analysis software were used. In a majority of cycles the value of f0, extracted from the EGG signal, could not be determined and therefore OQ could not be calculated. Where OQ could be determined, most subjects showed a pattern of slightly increasing OQ on average during the fricatives, though JG had a decrease in OQ in all cases. An analysis of variance, as described in Section 2.7, was used to investigate the statistical significance of differences between the mean OQ values in phones 1, 2 and 3. Unlike the other dependent variables considered in this study, the difference between subjects for the OQ was not significant at the 95% level (F(2,6)=0.239, p=0.68). Furthermore, for the OQ, none of the other effects was significant at the 95% level (Fricative ID: F(2,6)=2.339, p=0.22; Fricative ID vs phone: F(4,12)=0.918, p=0.48). 3.7 Relative measures The mean relative oral airflow and its standard deviation, for each subject, are shown in Table 6. The mean value for phone (1–2)% was calculated by taking the mean oral airflow oscillation amplitude for each token for a given subject and fricative, substituting the absolute oral airflow values into Eq. (1) and then averaging over all the phone (1–2)% values so calculated. A corresponding process was undertaken for phone (2–3)% for each subject and fricative using Eq. (2). There was no significant difference between the relative oral airflow values of males and females when tested by a t-test (t(22)=1.356, p=0.189). The relative mean f0 values (calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2) analogously to the method for oral airflow) varied from 3% to 13%, except for the female speaker JG who seemed to use a different f0 adjustment during fricative production with much larger relative changes, as shown in Table 7. The difference in relative measures between genders was significant for f0 (t(22)=3.297, p=0.003) even when the data for subject JG was excluded from the test. Neither relative mean IF1 nor relative mean OQ was considered as the number of tokens for which each could be reliably calculated was low. 4 Discussion Voicing maintenance during consonant production requires well known articulatory (Möbius, 2004, p. 24) and aerodynamic (Stevens, 1991) conditions. These alone do not, however, allow us to account for the frequent occurrences of devoicing observed in EP (Jesus & Shadle, 2002) and other languages (Smith, 1997). However, the voicing category results (Section 3.1), obtained using the criteria proposed by Jesus and Shadle (2002) with an adaptation to use the oral airflow in place of the acoustic signal, resulted in the identification of very few devoiced samples. There are different possible explanations for this. Subjects could have voiced more samples as an effect of the experimental setting (e.g., effect of the Rothenberg mask or the choice of stimuli). However, when the same corpus was recorded with a microphone and EGG for subject LJ and the criteria were applied jointly to those two signals, there was a much higher percentage of devoicing found. Although these results are not directly comparable to those of Jesus and Shadle (2002) because the corpus was different, LJ was also studied by Jesus and Shadle (2002) using EGG and acoustic signals and in that study also showed a tendency to devoicing significantly. We suggest therefore that the criteria used to define voicing categories based on the acoustic signal (as in Jesus and Shadle, 2002) are not adequate for our new framework based on the oral airflow signal. We hypothesise that the small oscillations seen in the fricative oral airflow (which relate to production) do not generally produce significant acoustic excitation (which relates to perception) and that these low amplitude oscillations, often with little higher frequency content (perhaps resulting from minute mucosal oscillations for an open glottis), are only weakly related to measurable periodicity in the acoustic signal. Our observations indicate that the quality of the voicing during the fricatives generally differs from that observed during the contextual vowels. The mean absolute oral airflow amplitude, though varying widely between subjects, conforms to a general pattern of reduced oral airflow during phone 2 regardless of which fricative a subject produces. Previously, place of articulation has been shown to have an effect on the number of devoiced fricative tokens: “… the percentage of devoicing increased as the place of articulation moved posteriorly.” (Jesus & Shadle, 2003, p. 5). Place of articulation has also been shown to have an effect on the aerodynamic properties of stops (Ohala, 1983). Some of these patterns have also been observed for our tokens, but the results were not statistically significant which may be a result of analysing devoicing in terms of the oral airflow rather than the acoustic signal. There were also no significant differences in the f0 estimate for the different fricatives. For all subjects except RS, for any given fricative, phone 2 had a significantly lower f0 value than the other two phones. Voiced obstruents have previously been shown (Ohde, 1984, p. 226) to have lower f0 values than adjacent vowels and the lowering of the laryngeal structures has long been known (Ohala, 1972) to decrease the value of f0. Löfqvist, Baer, McGarr, and Story (1989) present f0 values and cricothyroid muscle activity levels for vowels following obstruents and infer “…that an increased longitudinal tension of the vocal folds…” (Löfqvist, et al., 1989, p. 1320) could account for voicing distinctions (lower f0 during voiced obstruent production). We therefore believe that the significant differences that we have observed in f0 result from different voicing strategies between vowels and obstruents as a result of some combination of laryngeal lowering and vocal fold abduction. Vibration of the vocal folds can only occur when two physiological and aerodynamic conditions are met. First, the vocal folds must be suitably adducted and tensed. Second, a sufficient trans-glottal pressure gradient is needed to cause enough positive airflow through the glottis to maintain vibration. There is a recognised difficulty in supporting vibration during fricative production because in order to produce adequate frication the oral pressure should be high but voicing can only be maintained with a sufficient trans-laryngeal pressure drop (Ohala, 1983, p. 201). Therefore, it could be argued that the particular glottal constraints that have been reported in previous studies (Löfqvist et al., 1989; Ohala, 1972; Ohde, 1984; Watson, 1998) are related to mechanisms used to provide the oral pressure differential required for frication and result in a less constricted glottis (Ohala, 1983, p. 202). In a majority of the tokens analysed, IF1 could not be estimated for phone 2. Only subject RS produced measurable F1 values for the majority of phone 2 tokens. For the other subjects and in particular the female ones, F1 for phone 2 was substantially reduced or absent for a majority of measured utterances. Nevertheless, we could conclude that, where F1 was detectable, IF1 during fricative production was always on average reduced compared to the surrounding phones. Given that we expect voicing to be more damped in fricatives (in our data a longer OQ indicates the likelihood of this), lower F1 amplitude in phone 2 was perhaps to be expected as the observed acoustic excitation pattern for the vocal tract. To extract the open quotient of the signal, the method DEGG DECOM (Henrich et al., 2004), uses peaks at glottal opening and closure in the differentiated EGG (DEGG) signals to estimate f0 and hence OQ. At opening, they reported instances of imprecise peaks in some subjects which may prevent good estimates of OQ. At closing, all the samples they presented were for something approximating modal voice, where there is a clear glottal closed period. In our signals, for a perhaps more abducted glottis, the closure may be less definite or even incomplete leading to imprecise peaks at closing and hence poor detection of f0. This was the case for a majority of fricative tokens leading us to the conclusion that an OQ of 100%, or at least a very tentative glottal closure was quite a common occurrence. Where we could estimate a valid OQ, our results showed a slight increase in this parameter during the fricatives. Howard (1995, p. 166), suggested an increase in OQ value is related to a less physically efficient voice. He argued that this could be explained by the fact that an unobstructed acoustic tube from the lungs to the lips (through an open glottis) maintained for a greater portion of a glottal cycle resulted in higher subglottal damping. He also noted that more air from the lungs is expelled in each glottal cycle due to the longer open phase compromising “the efficiency of power source usage” and reinforcing a perception of breathiness (Howard, 1995, p. 166). It is notable that airflow in the fricative portion of the tokens (see Figs. 2–4) does not decay to zero during the “closed” phase of the glottal cycle. This may relate to the increase in OQ observed, but, according to Cranen and Schroeter (1995, p. 166) leak airflow cannot usually be explained solely on the basis of an incomplete adduction. A realistic model of airflow arising from a leaky glottis must also take into account a relatively gradual change in airflow during opening and closing and hence a weak acoustic excitation of the sub- and supra-glottal vocal tract. We have thus a situation in the oral airflow of voiced fricatives where traditional measures of voicing category designed for use with the acoustic and EGG signals are not valid since periodicity in the oral airflow continues even when associated only weakly with acoustic excitation of the vocal tract. The voicing regime represented by the oral airflow appears, however, to be substantially different to that found in the modal voicing of vowels having a smaller mean amplitude for the oral airflow fluctuations, lower fundamental frequency, a simpler harmonic structure with little or no excitation of the first formant of the vocal tract and a lengthened (frequently ∼100%) open quotient. We propose that this kind of laryngeal mode, which is expected to lead to a much lower level of acoustic excitation than the modal voicing of vowels, be designated weak voicing. 4.1 Defining weak voicing in obstruents Weak voicing has been regarded in most linguistics literature as what happens in voiced fricatives, stops and affricates. Weakly voiced obstruents have been described for Dutch (Ernestus & Baayen, 2007, pp. 3–5) as: “…voiceless obstruents that possess some acoustic characteristics of genuine voiced obstruents…”. Some voiced stops in Xhosa have been described as having “…short and weak voicing…” (Jessen & Roux, 2002, p. 1), resulting from “…the absence of closure voicing in most contexts…” (Jessen & Roux, 2002, p. 4). Jessen and Roux (2002) observed higher f0 values for vowels following “slack voicing” in stops and measured a number of spectral parameters (f0, H1, H2, F1, A1, F2, A2, F3 and A3) none of which seemed to provide information that could be clearly related to this voicing mechanism. However, their discussion about slack voicing (Jessen & Roux, 2002, pp. 38–39) hypothesised larynx lowering as the physiological mechanism responsible for most glottal leakage and devoicing during obstruent production, also resulting in lower f0 and F1 frequency. In fact, voicing in stops has long been regarded (Kingston & Diehl, 1995, pp. 8–9) as a low frequency acoustic property that can be observed “…during or shortly after the consonant constriction…” and results in “…a low f0 and F1 at the edges of vowels next to that interval…”. We now wish to further characterise weak voicing in obstruents on the basis of observed changes to the oral airflow waveform. Our results suggest that activity measurable in the oral airflow waveform may be only weakly related to events in the acoustic waveform due to the incomplete or tentative glottal closure and the consequent weak excitation of the vocal tract formants (see Fig. 5 where the secondary peaks in each cycle, present in the vowel but not in the fricative, relate to the vocal tract formants). Therefore, focus on the oral airflow waveform may give additional insight into laryngeal mechanisms in the generation of voiced obstruents that is not available from the output speech sound. With a definition of weak voicing based on the oral airflow signal alone, we could, for example, revisit specific EGG analysis techniques (Howard, Lindsey, & Allen, 1990; Rothenberg & Mahshie, 1988) for cases with a very low amplitude periodicity in the EGG signal (see Fig. 6). This might provide a new view on the classic problem of defining the meaning, in terms of physical activity in the larynx, of changes in the EGG signal during fricative and stop production (Childers, Hicks, Moore, Eskenazi, & Lalwani, 1990; Childers & Larar, 1984; Howard et al., 1990). One possibility is to define weak voicing as voicing with, say 100% (or perhaps >80%) open quotient. However, this may pose a technical problem in distinguishing voiced fricatives from breathy vowels, voiceless fricatives and stops, or any speech sound produced with a significant glottal chink (typical, for example, in female speakers). Weakly voiced speech frames could also be classified on the basis of an absolute oral airflow amplitude criterion of x cm3/s lower than the surrounding vowels. However, absolute values for the oral airflow and EGG vary significantly from subject to subject and are not ideal for setting definitive inter-subject criteria. We therefore propose to use a relative measure of oral airflow amplitude as the classification criterion since our measurements suggest this parameter does not differ significantly between subjects or by gender. Detailed analysis of our experimental data led to the empirical definition of an oral airflow amplitude threshold that could be used to define an epoch of weak voicing. This was based on the relative level of the oral airflow as defined by Eqs. (1) and (2). As can be seen from Fig. 7, the mean of the relative airflow values for subject HV and fricative /v/ taking data for phone (1–2)% and phone (2–3)% together is predominantly greater than 70%. Data for the other fricatives shows a similar pattern and again the means are predominantly greater than 70%. Through similarly considering the mean value of all the relative measures of oral airflow amplitude from all the tokens for all speakers we therefore defined a threshold of 70% on or above which, voicing in a fricative was considered to be weak compared to the strong voicing found in the surrounding contextual vowels. The outcomes of classifying all the tokens of the four speakers with this criterion are presented in the first five columns of Table 8. Here, a fricative is classified as weakly voiced if the mean of phone (1–2)% and phone (2–3)% is greater than or equal to 70%. When comparing these results with those obtained for the same data using Jesus and Shadle's (2002) criteria, presented in Table 1 and reproduced in columns 6–10 in Table 8, we observed a lower percentage of strong voicing (compared to the category voiced in Table 1) and a large number of weak voicing samples (compared to the sum of the categories partially devoiced and devoiced in Table 1). The numbers in the weak voicing category overall compare more favourably with the results presented by Jesus and Shadle (2002) as devoiced+partially devoiced (/v/ 61%; /z/ 89%; /ʒ/ 91%), though it must be borne in mind when making this comparison that for their study both the subjects (for the most part) and the corpus differed from ours. Classification based on a 70% threshold using values for oral airflow amplitude from phone (1–2)% alone gives the same or a slightly higher percentage of fricatives classified as having weak voicing (/v/ 60%; /z/ 71%; /ʒ/ 53% over all subjects) and using phone (2–3)% alone reduces the number classed as weakly voiced (/v/ 43%; /z/ 51%; /ʒ/ 38% over all subjects). 5 Conclusions and future work Our application of voicing category rules designed for the acoustic signal (Alphen & Smits, 2004; Jesus & Shadle, 2002) to the oral airflow suggests that new criteria are required to describe voicing during fricatives. This is largely due to the persistence of periodicity in the oral airflow signal that may be only weakly associated with acoustic excitation. Using the oral airflow signal to characterise behaviour during voiced fricatives may allow investigation of laryngeal mechanisms related to phone production that cannot easily be deduced from the acoustic signal. We have shown that the oral airflow signals in VFV sequences in real words can be characterised as having, during the production of the fricative, lower average oscillation amplitude, reduced amplitude of the formant oscillations, a longer open quotient and a generally lower f0 compared to that in the surrounding phones. Clearly, voicing in the fricatives of VFV sequences is qualitatively and quantitatively different to the modal voicing found in the surrounding vowels and we have denoted these changes collectively by the term weak voicing. A new and more general criterion for the definition of weak voicing, based on the analysis of the airflow signal, was presented. Our definition of this voicing mode is based on factors more closely related to phone production (laryngeal behaviour) than to the more perceptually orientated acoustic signal. Our classification criterion for weak voicing (≥70% relative reduction in the amplitude of oral airflow oscillations between the fricative and the surrounding vowels) has the advantage that it is based on the oral airflow signal alone and therefore does not rely on subjective interpretation of the relationship between the EGG signal and laryngeal activity. Our future work will focus on further defining the laryngeal mechanisms and the vibration mode during weak voicing and in exploring the relationship between these and the observed EGG signal. Parallels with the corresponding conditions in unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) patients have been presented in Pinho, Jesus, and Barney (in press).

        "doc_abstract": "Aims. To translate and adapt the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised to Portuguese using the ICNP® (International Classification of Nursing Practice) terminology and to determine if it can be administered reliably across examiners. Background. Assessment tools for the person in a coma can contribute to the planning, implementation and evaluation of care. It also strengthens the autonomy and responsibility of nurses, contributing to the safety, quality and satisfaction of those who deliver and receive care. This allows the sharing of information amongst healthcare professionals and supports decision-making within a multidisciplinary team. Methods. A convenience sample of 20 patients admitted to an intensive care unit constituted the study participants. The data were collected during 2009. The instrument was administered by the same two raters in all the patients on two consecutive days. The total and subscale score agreement was then examined, using inter-rater and test-retest analyses. The intercorrelation dependencies between the subscales were also analysed. Results. The results of the analyses suggest that the instrument can be used reliably, even when there are some patient fluctuations. The correlation of the subscale scores was high and better than the results presented for the original Coma Recovery Scale - Revised, indicating that this scale is a homogeneous measure of neurobehavioural function. Conclusion. The new instrument can be administered reliably by trained examiners and produces a high degree of reproducibility in scores between raters over repeated assessments. We believe that assessment tools that can assess the communication ability of patients will be relevant to evaluating the continuity of care, and promote the effectiveness of care. © 2011 The Authors.

The study explores acoustic properties related to voicing. The following acoustic properties were measured: voice onset time (VOT), stop duration, closure duration, release duration, voicing into closure duration, duration of the preceding vowel and duration of the following vowel. Results suggested that when [b d ] were devoiced, the acoustic properties stop duration, closure duration, duration of the following vowel, duration of the preceding vowel and duration of voicing into closure were relevant for the voicing distinction. Implications for research and practice in speech and language therapy are discussed. Further investigation is needed to find how the productions analysed in the present study were perceived by listeners, specifically productions of devoiced stops. © 2010 International Phonetic Association.",

The frequencies of high-amplitude peaks in the [χ] and spectra clearly indicate a back place of articulation, with median duration across subjects and words of 69 ms and 35 ms.

        "doc_abstract": "A new articulatory synthesizer (SAPWindows), with a modular and flexible design, is described. A comprehensive acoustic model and a new interactive glottal source were implemented. Perceptual tests and simulations made possible by the synthesizer contributed to deepening our knowledge of one of the most important characteristics of European Portuguese, the nasal vowels. First attempts at incorporating models of frication into the articulatory synthesizer are presented, demonstrating the potential of performing fricative synthesis based on broad articulatory configurations. Synthesis of nonsense words and Portuguese words with vowels and nasal consonants is also shown. Despite not being capable of competing with mainstream concatenative speech synthesis, the anthropomorphic approach to speech synthesis, known as articulatory synthesis, proved to be a valuable tool for phonetics research and teaching. This was particularly true for the European Portuguese nasal vowels. © 2005 Hindawi Publishing Corporation.",

Two devoicing criteria (a manual criterion and a criterion based on the ratio of variances of the laryngograph signal during the VF transition and during the fricative) were used to classify the examples into two or three categories. The results of the automatic and manual measures of devoicing are compared, and an explanation for observed misclassifications is presented. Devoicing occurs extensively in Portuguese; results are compared to those for English.",

Substantial differences were found between spectra of voiced and unvoiced, same-place fricatives. The parameters spectral slope, frequency of maximum amplitude, and dynamic amplitude, derived from previous studies, behaved as predicted for changes in effort level, voicing, and location within the fricative. Changes in syllable stress, however, did not affect the fricatives in a manner consistent with effort level variation.
