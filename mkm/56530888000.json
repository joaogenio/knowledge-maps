Full anonymity has no traceable identifiers to report diagnosis results. Moreover, implicit and explicit consent routes are of practical importance under recent data protection regulations (GDPR), translating directly into break-the-glass requirements. Pseudonymisation is an acceptable compromise when dealing with such orthogonal requirements and is an advisable measure to protect data. Our work presents a pseudonymisation protocol that is compliant with implicit and explicit consent routes. The protocol is constructed on a (t,n)-threshold secret sharing scheme and public key cryptography. The pseudonym is safely derived from a fragment of public information without requiring any data-subject's secret. The method is proven secure under reasonable cryptographic assumptions and scalable from the experimental results.",

With billions of devices connected via the Internet, opportunities for smart applications increase tremendously. Unfortunately that is also the case for the risks. This means that security and privacy of the Internet of Things are aspects that need to be addressed timely and thoroughly. This briefing paper points out that when designing and implementing infrastructures and applications a number of questions need to be answered in order to take well-founded decisions. Addressing these questions is the responsibility of a variety of stakeholders. The roles and responsibilities of the various groups of players are introduced in this paper as Key points to take away. 1 What is the Internet of Things? The Internet of Things, or IoT, could be labelled as “buzzword”, a fashionable term that has become very popular. IoT is nonetheless an important and dynamically evolving aspect of the ICT field. But what does it mean? As already mentioned in the IFIP Position Paper “IoT: Do we have a choice?” (IoT March 2019) there are many definitions of the IoT. Moreover, definitions evolve over time as mentioned also in the Wikipedia page on the IoT A combination of some definitions gives a good idea of what the IoT is: “The Internet of Things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices (also referred to as “thing”, “object”, “connected devices” or “smart devices”) such as vehicles, buildings, and other items such as home appliances embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity, which enable these devices to collect and exchange data and interact with others over the Internet, possibly for remote monitoring and control.” As is often the case with buzzwords, variations are used to specify subsets or to give a different perspective. This also applies to the Internet of Things, with terms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the Internet of Everything (IoE), and – as a more discipline-specific example – the Internet of Medical Things (or indeed Internet of Health Things). As long as the reader has a general sense of what the IoT is, the exact definition in principle is not the most important element. However, it is important to realize that there are differences between a consumer-oriented environment and an industry-oriented environment. Examples of the consumer-oriented environment are smart home applications for energy management and for assisting elderly people and people with disabilities. Industry-oriented environments include cyber-physical systems in for instance smart energy grids and process control in supply chain networks. 2 Why is security and privacy important? The growth in the number of connected devices is almost beyond imagination. Many consultancy and market research companies present statistics and predictions (10 Charts That Will Challenge Your Perspective Of IoT's Growth June 2018; Roundup Of Internet Of Things December 2018). For example: IoT adoption gaining momentum 2016 2017 2018 2030 IoT units installed base - total (m) 6,382 8,381 11,197 125,000 Consumer devices (m) 3,963 5,244 7,036 75,000 Consumer devices as a% of total devices 62% 63% 63% 60% Connected devices per person 5 5 5 5 World population (m) 7,400 7,600 7,700 8,500 IoT adoption rate 11% 14% 18% 176% Source: DBS Bank based on estimates by Gartner, United Nations, World Bank In: Internet of Things: The Pillar of Artificial Intelligence – Sector Briefing Number 63 – DBS Asian Insights – DBS Group Research – June 2018 (Internet of Things June 2018). Given these figures it is almost inevitable that most, if not all of us, will be confronted with Internet connected devices in our home or work environment. Devices collecting data about our behavior and wishes, about our systems’ states and changes and about our physical and perhaps even mental condition. Devices acting upon these data by automatically replenishing stock, adjusting positions, advising us to move into a certain direction, prescribing medicine, etcetera. The risk of faulty decisions, either by mistake or on purpose, is increasing. This requires extra attention for security and privacy issues in the IoT. 3 What are the security and privacy concerns with respect to IoT? The increasing number of connected devices also increases the security and privacy threats. Cases of malware infected devices in the consumer environment being used for DDoS attacks on industrial applications (think for instance on Internet banking systems) are already a reality. A well-known case is the Mirai malware. 1 1 [accessed 16-02-2020] The growing number of devices collecting data about individuals also makes it more and more difficult to stay in control of your personal data. That increases the risk of privacy breaches. While most security threats do apply to the Internet of Things, they are on the one hand not specific for the IoT, on the other hand the risks may be bigger due to the numbers. Take for instance unauthorised access to devices enabling an unauthorised person to interfere with or collect data. If we talk about billions of connected devices, it is obvious that the risk of this happening is substantial. In addition, the consequences of threats that materialized are much bigger. Confidentiality, integrity and availability remain the key objectives, but there are specific features when addressing security and privacy issues for IoT infrastructure and applications. A whole lot of questions have to be answered in order to take well-founded decisions: • who collects data; • where are they stored; • who has access to the data; • are data anonymized; • who is responsible for the security; • who decides what an acceptable risk level is; • who owns the data; • how much control do users have on their own data • what are the liability arrangements; • what can be legally enforced in terms of collecting data; • who is responsible for decisions based on incorrect data; • can you opt in or opt out; • who takes care of communications security; • etcetera. Addressing these questions is a responsibility of the players involved: ICT professionals, users (both consumers and companies), ICT industry, authorities / regulators. All players can and must contribute to developing, implementing and using a safe and secure IoT infrastructure and applications. What roles and responsibilities the various groups of players have is briefly introduced in the next chapter: Key points to take away. 4 Key points to take away 4.1 ICT professionals ICT professionals should have sufficient professional and ethical competences to make the right choices when designing, developing, implementing, operating or managing software / hardware as part of an Internet of Things that is able to offer choices to its users. Having sufficient professional and ethical competences is a general requirement for ICT professionals. However, in an IoT environment this is especially important because users may not be aware of the fact that choices are, could or should be possible. Users also may not be in a position to demand choices or to influence the usage of collected data. Therefore, the professionals should see to it that such choices are embedded and offered. Users should be informed about the benefits and risks of Internet of Things applications they use. If the owner or developer of such applications does not (sufficiently) inform the users, ICT professionals have a choice, maybe even a duty, to do this (for instance via research papers and publications). In order to be able to do this, there should be no legal liability when publishing such results. 4.2 Users Users at least must have a choice to switch off the connection or not use the smart part of smart devices. In other words, users should have an opt in or opt out choice. They should be able to control and personalize the behavior of smart objects and associated applications. There may be applications or circumstances where it is not possible or desirable to give users an opt in or opt out choice, for instance in cases where national security is at stake. When this is the case, it should be clearly explained to users. Users should inform themselves about the various aspects (benefits / risks) of the devices that are connected in the IoT they are using. A condition to help users is the availability of “a set of the right questions”. 4.3 ICT industry ICT industry providing IoT applications and systems should inform users about the benefits and potential risks. It has to be clear for users for which purposes data are collected. A mechanism needs to be in place to assure the security and protection of such collected data and providers should inform users about these mechanisms. It should also be made clear what the consequences of either choice (opt in or opt out) are. ICT industry should not develop IoT applications that provide data that can be used without the owners of the data knowing about the use or consenting to it. The ICT industry providing IoT applications and devices must ensure that every element in the IoT architecture is secure. This includes hardware/devices, communications as well as applications. All these elements have to work together to secure end-to-end security, because one weakness can lead to a security breach of a complete system. Many methods of securing all these areas in the IoT architecture exist, and it is important for the reader to understand that IoT architecture might have different and unique security needs compared with traditional systems. The ability to create and maintain a secure end-to-end infrastructure will require well-defined cybersecurity policies and active collaboration between standard bodies, policymakers, regulators, and enterprises. 4.4 Authorities / regulators Policymakers and regulators should take into account the interests of users when regulating the use of (personal) data (including data that can be linked to a person in an indirect way e.g. via home, car, etc.). It is important that policies and regulations provide the conditions for the choices that users and providers can or should be able to make. Professionals and users working in standard setting bodies have to provide guidance for choosing and using standards. When it comes to IoT standards, many standards, frameworks and guidelines have been published. One can argue that with too many standards, frameworks and controls to choose from, there is a likelihood of implementing either the wrong standard or none at all. That would not help managing the risks.

This work proposes data structures to represent Self-Sovereign Identities and to handle those features in a consolidated architecture. Key-management is constructed using secret sharing principles, capable of recovering from a lost or compromised key to a new one without losing track of the original account. Pseudonymity and data minimisation is established using anonymous profiles, showing different views of the same identity. Non-repudiation is contemplated in the profile disclosure process. Profiles are protected against tampering with the use of digital signatures and blockchain cryptographic constructions. All profiles and registries are controlled with a single asymmetric key pair that can be provided by a smart card. Flexible structures are defined that can be used to register claims, attestations, authorisation grants, user consents, or any other activities. All definitions take into consideration the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In a scenario where hotspot wireless networks are increasingly being used, and given the amount of sensitive information exchanged on Internet interactions, there is the need to implement security mechanisms that guarantee data confidentiality and integrity in such networks, as well as the authenticity of the hotspot providers. However, many hotspots today use Captive Portals, which rely on authentication through Web pages (thus, an application-level authentication approach) instead of a link-layer approach. The consequence of this is that there is no security in the wireless link to the hotspot (it has to be provided at upper protocol layers), and is cumbersome to manage wireless access profiles (we need special applications or browsers’ add-ons to do that). This work exposes the weaknesses of the Captive Portals’ paradigm, which does not follow a unique nor standard approach, and describes a solution that intends to suppress them, based on the 802.1X architecture. It relies on EAP-SH (extended authentication protocol for secure hotspots), a new EAP-compliant protocol that is able to integrate a Web-based registration or authentication with a Captive Portal within the 802.1X authentication framework. This work describes its design, implementation and prototype evaluation.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A key characteristic of Smart Cities is the ability to reduce conflicts between different agents coexisting in a dynamic system, such as the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. This paper presents a system to augment the awareness of vehicle drivers regarding the presence of pedestrians in nearby crosswalks. The proposed system interconnects Road Side Units (RSUs), which are informed about the state of the crosswalks, and vehicles, in order to spread to vehicles, the information about the presence of pedestrians in crosswalks. To prevent false information spreading, RSUs sign the alert messages they broadcast and all vehicles can validate the signatures. This poses strong security requirements, such as non-repudiation of alert messages, as well as strong real-time requirements, such as minimum message validation delays among vehicles approaching a crosswalk of interest. To manage the signed alert messages, we are proposing Nimble Asymmetric Cryptography (NAC), which authenticates implicit broadcast messages. NAC minimizes the usage of asymmetric ciphers, which are fundamental to assure non-repudiation but increase performance penalties and uses hash chaining for source authentication of implicit messages.",

The results were communicated to the relevant entities so actions could be taken. After one year, we performed a new assessment to check for evolution. This paper presents the results of this second assessment. We found a significantly better situation, although still with plenty of room for improvement: 31 municipal websites were classified as Good (20 more), while 42 less were classified as Bad (100 in total). We concluded that two determinants that were identified as contributing to explain the results of the first study - municipal taxes and total population - do not contribute to explain the improvements observed in this assessment. We believe that we contributed to those improvements by raising awareness to the high number of municipalities not using or badly using HTTPS.",

We generate a separate GMM for each class of applications using component-wise expectation-maximization (CEM) to match the network traffic distribution generated by these applications. We apply our models for both traffic classification, where the goal is to identify the source application from which the traffic originates, by evaluating the maximum posterior probability, and for traffic verification, where the goal is to verify whether the application that claims to be the source of the traffic is as expected, by likelihood testing. Our models use only the first initial packets of truncated flows in order to provide more efficient and timely traffic classification and verification. This allows for triggering timely countermeasures before the end of flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experiments on a public dataset collected from a real network. Our traffic classification approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches that are based on machine learning, and achieves up to 97.7% flow classification accuracy when using only 9 first initial packets of flows. We show that 96.6% flow classification accuracy can still be obtained when training the GMMs using only 0.5% of all flows. Our traffic verification approach achieves a minimum Half Total Error Rate (HTER) of 7.65% when using only 6 first initial packets of flows.",

Our main goal was to deal with a fine-grained control in the access to IoT data and devices, to prevent devices from being manipulated by attackers and to avoid information leaking from IoT devices to unauthorized recipients. The access control is split: the management of authentication and access control policies is centered on special components (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Controllers), which can be distributed or centralized, and the actual enforcement of access control decisions happens on the entities that stay in the path to the IoT devices (Gateways and Device Drivers). The authentication in the entire system uses asymmetric cryptography and pre-distributed unique identifiers derived from public keys; no Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used. A Kerberos-like ticket-based approach is used to establish secure sessions.",

Although being faster than other equivalent algorithms, the ECDSA computational cost nevertheless affects the message validation throughput. Even worse, the number of messages that a device has to authenticate may easily exhaust its computational limits. In this article, we evaluated the impact caused by ECDSA authentication of messages of the multi-hop routing control plane used in a real Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). Such control plane uses periodic vicinity updates to keep accurate, distributed routing paths, and ECDSA-based validation delays may force to discard many of such updates. To perform the evaluation of the impact imposed by ECDSA we considered the multiple curve parameters associated to WAVE and ETSI ITS, their implementation by different cryptographic libraries and their performance in distinct hardware.

Both the WAVE IEEE 1609.2 standard in USA and the ETSI ITS security standards in Europe rely on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to authenticate messages exchanged among vehicles. Although being faster than other equivalent algorithms, the ECDSA computational cost nevertheless affects the message validation throughput. Even worse, the number of messages that a device has to authenticate may easily exhaust its computational limits. In this article, we evaluated the impact caused by ECDSA authentication of messages of the multi-hop routing control plane used in a real Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). Such control plane uses periodic vicinity updates to keep accurate, distributed routing paths, and ECDSA-based validation delays may force to discard many of such updates. To perform the evaluation of the impact imposed by ECDSA we considered the multiple curve parameters associated to WAVE and ETSI ITS, their implementation by different cryptographic libraries and their performance in distinct hardware. We took as reference for traffic to be authenticated with ECDSA a day-long set of messages of a VANET routing control plane. These messages were inferred from connectivity status samples from all mobile nodes of a real VANET. Emulation results with those messages show that, without high-end computing devices, ECDSA authentication would have a substantial negative impact in the routing service of the tested VANET. Keywords VANET Broadcast authentication ECDSA Performance evaluation 1 Introduction Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are networks that possess a constantly changing topology, and therefore, are very challenging for setting up the ordinary end-to-end IP routing. In particular, the control plane that manages routing paths (ordinary IP routing, georouting, etc.) has to take timely and accurate decisions to have a reasonably high delivery rate. This means that adding security to such scenario, namely source authentication of messages received by VANET nodes, has the potential to partially or totally disrupt the overall routing effectiveness of the VANET. Both WAVE IEEE 1609 [1] and ETSI ITS-G5 [2] make use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to authenticate broadcast messages exchanged among devices. For the same level of security, ECDSA is faster and produces shorter signatures when compared with other alternative algorithms [3]. In spite of mitigating the impact of source authentication, the computational overhead imposed by ECDSA was already associated to delays and losses of safety information [4] and to the degradation of applications related with emergency braking signalling and crash avoidance [5,6]. In the case of a routing service, the impact of using ECDSA (according to WAVE IEEE 1609 or ETSI ITS-G5) was never addressed by the research community. Since the debut of VANETs, there has been a significant number of proposals for their traffic routing, and the topic is still very challenging in practice [7,8]. The most challenging task in a VANET routing service is to keep the information updated and propagate the changes as fast as possible. Therefore, we can easily envision that the effectiveness of secure routing service will naturally depend on the overhead associated to the applied security mechanisms, since these impose delays. In this article, we evaluate the minimum impact of the ECDSA computational overhead when used by an IP routing service in a VANET. By minimum we mean that we consider only overheads resulting from the validation of signatures in received messages from the routing control plane. We do not consider overheads imposed by protocols to distribute and validate the public keys of the vehicles, by the production of signatures by transmitters and by the authentication of IP traffic. ECDSA overheads are evaluated considering alternative elliptic curve parameters, libraries and hardware. For our evaluation we take as reference data collected from a real VANET, deployed in the city of Porto, Portugal. This VANET uses the IEEE 1609.2 standard and interconnects buses, which makes it sparse. 1 1 The data was collected from a maximum of 210 active devices at the same time in an area of 35 km2 and a maximum of 57 neighbours per device. The original contributions of this study are: • An analysis of the impact of ECDSA validations, when used by a routing service exploiting WAVE IEEE 1609 and ETSI ITS-G5, performed by recent versions of multiple cryptographic libraries, considering a current device of our reference VANET, as well as alternative hardware; • The results showing that, without high-end computing devices, the computational overhead associated to ECDSA has a relevant impact in the VANET’s routing service, in spite of the VANET’s sparsity and its resilience to message delays up to one second. 2 2 Because routing tables are updated by the second. The document is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present the related work. In Section 3 we characterise the VANET used as reference in this study. In Section 4 we measure the performance of multiple implementations of ECDSA in different CPU architectures. In Section 5 we evaluate the impact of ECDSA validations in the routing service of our reference VANET. Finally, Section 6 concludes the document and highlights future work. 2 Related work WAVE IEEE 1609 and ETSI ITS-G5 rely on ECDSA for source authentication [1,2]. Both standards assume the possibility of multi-hop connectivity and IP support, but the computational impact of ECDSA on routing in VANETs was never a topic of study. This means that the losses on number (or quality) of routes, as well as the amount of traffic to be routed and discarded due to ECDSA overheads are unknown metrics. Even so, the computational impact of ECDSA has been a justification to define alternative strategies to build secure routing protocols from scratch to VANETs [9,10], but the impact of applying ECDSA source authentication to already existing (insecure) routing strategies, that perform well in some scenarios, is also an unknown. In this work we analyse the impact of upgrading an insecure routing service, currently deployed in a city-scale VANET, into a secure one, according to WAVE IEEE 1609. The analysis focuses on the impact of ECDSA on the number and quality of routes, as well as the routing information discarded by devices. In 2005, Raya and Hubaux [11] claimed that the ability to verify a signature in 1.5 microseconds was enough to fulfil VANET’s safety requirements. This claim was based on a simple assumption of vehicles’ distribution over a highway, a broadcast of messages in periods of 300 ms, and the need to validate up to 120 messages per 300 microseconds. These conditions are not compatible with higher broadcast frequencies, such as 10 Hz as suggested by WAVE IEEE 1609 [12]. Furthermore, they are not compatible with the existence of other services or applications running in the device and consuming part of its resources [13]. To the best of our knowledge, the studies that analyse the impact of ECDSA in VANETs were explicitly associated to scenarios where low latency for safety messages are explored [4–6,14–16]. In such cases, they all reached to the same conclusion, either directly or indirectly: the negative impact of ECDSA operations requires high-end computational devices, such as recent personal computers. However, according to Li et al.[17], a large city-scale VANET made out of personal computers is not expected to be deployed in the near future, neither it is compatible with some operational conditions, such as cost and battery consumption [18,19]. In our work we consider both high-end personal computers and the devices operating in a real VANET, which are mid-range microcomputers. In our work, which deals with non-safety messages, we did not have many assumptions for message rates, nor to their maximum acceptable delay, but we had a deployed VANET that performs well for IP routing. Therefore, we used that VANET and its IP routing service to assess the minimum overall impact that ECDSA would have in such service, which is already resilient to message delays up to 1 s. Dai et al.[20] implemented and tested a WAVE-based secured vehicular communication system. They presented a set of results from tests made with real devices, but only with a limited population and not according to the mobility patterns expected to be found in a city. In the tests they used a single library implementing ECDSA, but no justification was provided for the selection criteria. They concluded that ECDSA can fulfil the requirement of message broadcast authentication within 100 ms, and that the performance of security algorithms can be improved. Comparing our work with this last one, with respect to the performance of ECDSA operations, we first tested a large set of candidate libraries, in order to find out the topmost of them in terms of computation speed, and we used them as reference. Regarding the evaluation of the impact of ECDSA operations, we used real traces collected from an operational VANET, instead of relying on real tests on a VANET. This allowed us to analyse a scenario with hundreds of devices without the logistic problems of real tests, and still, take the benefits of the mobility and propagation information implicitly provided by the sampled VANET. Furthermore, it allowed us to assess the impact of ECDSA on the exact same mobility and propagation circumstances (inferred from the samples). Bendouma and Bensaber [21] proposed a protocol for authenticating RSUs using elliptic curve cryptography. Their proposal disregards the authentication of OBUs among themselves and evaluates the protocol only for a single and fast CPU type, which is not representative of a typical VANET device (AMD Opteron 8354 @ 2.2GHz), and uses a single cryptographic library (Crypto++), which is among the slowest that we have evaluated. Therefore, their (absolute) results could not be used to extrapolate information in the study that we performed for our target VANET. Furthermore, the authors did not evaluate the impact of authentication delays in any other service. Ravi and Kulkarni [22] proposed to use ECDSA for authenticating traffic routed with AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector). Since AODV is completely different from the routing protocol used in our target VANET (SB2RP, see Section 3), their results cannot be extrapolated. Furthermore, they used a single, Java implementation for ECDSA, whilst we looked for faster libraries (written in assembly, C or C++) and we chose the faster one for our tests. 3 Characterisation of the reference VANET Our work is based on the VANET [23] operating in the metropolitan area of the city of Porto, Portugal, which implements an (insecure) IP routing service, known as Service-Based Layer-2 Routing Protocol (SB2RP) [24]. This VANET includes 396 On Board Units (OBUs), carried by buses, and 50 Road Side Units (RSUs), mostly placed in the centre of an area with nearly 400 km2. IP routing is currently used to connect OBUs with a central infrastructure (through RSUs), in order to provide Internet connectivity to bus passengers. IP routes within the VANET are limited to a maximum of 3 hops along OBUs. Since the VANET spans the area covered by the buses, but RSUs are not homogeneously scattered in that area, we do not consider areas where OBUs cannot have multi-hop connectivity with any RSU. Therefore, we restricted our study to a 35 km2 central area where IP routes to the Internet exist (Fig. 1 ). This means that data samples collected by each OBU were discarded when the OBU was operating outside the restricted area. SB2RP is a WAVE application that implements a periodic distance-vector routing protocol to route IP traffic between the infrastructure and OBUs. Routing control plane messages (beacons) are broadcast according to the WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) in periods of 100 ms. Each device stores the information received on SB2RP messages from neighbours (radio links and associated signal quality) in an auxiliary table. SB2RP messages sent by the VANET devices are built based on the most recent information present on the auxiliary table. For quickly removing stale routing paths, the auxiliary table is a short-term cache: entries older than 1.5 s are removed. IP routing tables are updated by each second with the information stored in the auxiliary table. For each possible destination, it is selected the shortest path with the best quality. The quality is given by the sum of all RSSIs (Received Signal Strength Indications) of all links belonging to a multi-hop path. For our performance tests, we used the 4th generation of hardware used by VENIAM 3 3 www.veniam.com in both OBU and RSU devices of our target VANET at the time of writing. These are equipped with an ARM Cortex-A7 CPU (i.MX 6 at 800 MHz) and running a Linux kernel to support a small set of tools. This hardware is representative of characteristics commonly found in VANET devices [17,25]. Our scenario represents a VANET where only a relatively small number of the vehicles present in the city are part of the network, which facilitates the deployment of new features. Given an operational service (IP routing), the motivation was to analyse the possibility of using the IEEE 1609.2 to add security (source authentication) to this insecure application without a serious degradation of the service. While surveying works related with the computational overhead of IEEE 1609.2 [4–6], it became evident that none of them would be useful to answer our question, since they all analysed most demanding scenarios assoto safety applications. Compared with the previous analysis targeting safety applications, there are three prominent differences: • Our VANET encompasses only public buses, being sparser (and thus, requiring fewer validations per second) than vehicular networks formed by all vehicles, either in urban or highway scenarios [4–6,8]. • Its IP routing service is used to allow buses’ passengers to have a best-effort Internet access, thus its distributed operation is more tolerant to delays and losses of neighbouring information than any safety application. While IP tables are updated by the second, based on information collected in the last 1.5s, the same cannot happen for safety applications (e.g., 1 s at 60 km/h represents 16.7 m, which can be relevant for taking timely decisions). • The vehicles’ anonymity is not a requirement, and so, pseudonyms are not needed. This allows us to assume that, after an initial period, all certificates were already verified once and each received message just needs one signature validation to be authenticated (the best case scenario). 4 Computational cost of ECDSA validations The ECDSA is used together with a set of parameters that define the elliptic curve (EC) and some auxiliary values. There are multiple specifications of parameters proposed independently by institutions and individuals [36–39]. One of the parameters is the key length, which is associated to the computational cost of ECDSA operations and to its expected security in a near future. Longer keys lead to slower operations 4 4 Considering the same underlying algorithms and implementations. and provide more security. With a key length of 224 bit or more, ECDSA has an acceptable security until 2030 [40]. Both WAVE IEEE 1609 and ETSI ITS-G5 specify the use of the EC known as NIST P256 [37], which uses a 256-bit key. In addition, WAVE IEEE 1609 also supports the EC known as Brainpool P256r1 [38]. In both standards, the ECDSA is applied to the output of a SHA-256 hash function [41]. In Table 1 we show the libraries used in this study along with the correspondent version (or git commit identifier), release date and implementation language. We evaluate implementations provided by 9 different libraries, and one of them (LibTomCrypt [31]) was tested with three distinct mathematical libraries: LibTomMath and TomsFastMath [31] and GMP [32]. All libraries implement NIST P256, while only 3 implement Brainpool P256r1: OpenSSL, LibreSSL and Mbed TLS. We evaluate the libraries in 4 different platforms targeting different CPUs: • ARM Cortex-A7 at 800 MHz, from an OBU in use in the VANET (OBU); • ARM Cortex-A53 at 1.2 GHz, from a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2 (RP3); • Intel i5-3317U at 1.70 GHz, from a laptop computer (laptop); • Intel i7-7700 at 3.00 GHz, from a desktop computer (desktop). These devices represent the 2 types of computing capabilities found in a VANET: micro and personal computers. The libraries were tested in an equivalent version of the same operating system (Debian Gnu/Linux) and compiled with GCC 7.2.0. We used the CPP programming language to build a minimal setup according to each library needs. For each of the platforms, we measured the time taken to verify a signature of the 2 ECs, NIST P256 and Brainpool P256r1. For each case we produced and validated 1000 signatures. Considering the average time of signature validations, Table 2 shows the 5 best and the worst of the libraries for NIST P256, while Table 3 shows all the results for Brainpool P256r1. The results show that OpenSSL provides the faster implementations of both ECs across all the devices. For NIST P256, the best case for a microcomputer, 1716 microseconds in the OBU, is about 25 times slower than the best case in a personal computer, 64 microseconds in the desktop. As expected [42], Brainpool P256r1, due to its underlying characteristics, is slower than NIST P256 in all the devices, but the difference between the 2 types of computers is reduced to a factor of 10. Considering the results for OpenSSL on the OBU and the RP3, NIST P256 is faster in the slower CPU, whilst for Brainpool P256r1 is the opposite. This occurs due to the different optimisations that can be applied to mathematical operations, and the performance of those optimisations in different CPU architectures. The use of different algorithms and implementations for the underlying mathematical operations is the main reason for the wide variations yield by different libraries [43]. The libraries with implementations in assembly language are the ones with the best performance. OpenSSL has an assembly implementation of the 2 ECs tested for all the CPU architectures in analysis, which justifies its overall winning performance. 5 Impact of ECDSA in a VANET routing service This evaluation was performed with a trace-based emulator called loop [44]. Instead of mobility and propagation models, we used 24 h (from 18: 00 to 18: 00 in February 2015) of real status traces periodically collected from a real VANET (see Section 3). These traces encompass both real mobility of the vehicles and the real connectivity between the vehicles. The status traces are formed by the information collected by each device about its GPS location and about its neighbours (identification and RSSI), saved at each 2 s. The real mobility and communication characteristics are embedded in those traces, and this allowed us to remove a huge stack of complexity, delay and possible sources of biased results. Those traces were used to recreate the transmission of WAVE messages (beacons) in our emulator according to the real scenario by using a straightforward rationale: if a device is referred in a status trace, then at least one beacon from that device was received in the last 1.5 s. Based on the lists of the neighbours per device, we simulated the transmission and reception of beacons in periods of 100ms and enforced their authentication before using them. The IP routing tables of each device are built based on the received beacons. Since the connectivity created by the routing protocol is limited up to 3 hops to an RSU, not all active devices are able to create IP routes, nor all beacons have routing information. Along the 24 h of the status traces, the number of active devices, the number of devices possible to be connected by IP routes (within the 3 hops limit of an RSU) and the correspondent neighbouring devices varied according to Fig. 2 . This figure shows the average values for intervals of 10 min, and the maximum standard deviation for the number of active OBUs and the number of OBUs within 3 hops from an RSU is σ = 9.06 . Considering the scenario described in Section 3 and the best results of Section 4, our goal was to measure the impact in the routing capability of the VANET due to the use of ECDSA according to WAVE IEEE 1609.2. We executed 64 emulations for the 24h of available traces and grouped the results in periods of 10 min. In each emulation it was used a different seed to initialise a pseudo-random number generator that provides some variability to each emulation. The variability consisted in changing the relative order in which devices broadcast beacons to each other, within a 100 ms time window. The 95% confidence level of the mean values used to calculate the percentages presented in Figs. 3 –5 is smaller than 0.1% of the correspondent mean, in all the cases. Metrics related with the validation of routing messages were updated each 100 ms, while the ones related with IP routes were updated each 1 s. We used the computational time shown in Table 2 to derive an upper bound for the number of signatures possible to validate in an OBU currently deployed in the target VANET. Since an OBU has to do more than building routing tables, we assumed that utmost 25% of its CPU could be reserved for the authentication of beacons. Considering the library with the faster validation time for the OBU in Table 2 (OpenSSL, 1.7 ms per validation) and a maximum CPU workload of 25% exclusively for ECDSA signature validation, we reached a maximum of 15 validations per 100 ms. We used 16, a slightly higher value, for dealing with multiples and sub-multiples of this value in further assessments considering different computational capabilities. Assuming a secure routing solution limited to a maximum of 16 beacon validations per 100 ms, we compared it with the case where there is no security overhead and all the beacons (the reference of 100% in Fig. 3) are consumed, naive routing. We present different results from a VANET perspective and from a device perspective. From the perspective of the exchanged beacons, Fig. 3 shows that, with secure routing, there are some periods where less beacons are consumed than with naive routing. There are two reasons for that: there are more useless beacons (i.e., beacons that do not give any useful route) and devices are not able to validate beacons before consuming them (during a 100ms window). Note that beacons without useful routing information do not need to be validated; therefore, all active devices that are more than 3 hops away from an RSU do not contribute to the variation of the percentage of useful beacons discarded due to ECDSA validation limitations. The devices discarding information are only the ones within the 3 hops limit. This figure reveals a correlation between the average number of neighbours (see Fig. 2) and the saturation of the validation process: with the increase of neighbours, there are more devices discarding at least one message with useful information. From the perspective of the impact on the routing service, Fig. 4 shows that, across the 24 h, the percentage of destinations that disappear from the VANET is always smaller than 3%, while the percentage of equivalent routes (i.e., routes to the same destination with the same number of hops and same quality) ranges from a maximum of 99% to a minimum of 53%. Non-optimum routes are the ones with more hops or the same number of hops but with lower transmission quality. The periods with the higher percentage of discarded beacons are coincident with the periods of smaller percentage of equivalent routes, which is an expected outcome. With individual routing awareness defined as the percentage of routes that are equivalent (i.e., same number of hops and same transmission quality) for both secure and naive routings, a complementary vision of the impact of ECDSA is given in Fig. 5. This figure shows the percentage of devices that are able to keep their individual awareness above a given threshold. This metric follows the approach defined by Schmidt et al. [45], where awareness is defined as “the relation between knowledge of vehicles that is stored in a vehicle’s neighbour table and the knowledge of vehicles that should be stored.” The represented percentiles of individual routing awareness show that a negative impact in Fig. 5 affects the VANET by affecting the majority of the devices. Table 4 presents a subset of results for some of the previously analysed parameters, considering a different number of validations than the ones possible with the hardware used as reference. Although the maximum number of neighbours listened by a device is 57 (in our data set), with 48 validations per 100 ms there is no impact in the routing service. 5.1 Discussion The results obtained provide important insights and reveal that, without devices with a substantial computational power, ECDSA, and consequently IEEE 1609.2, would have a negative impact in the scenario that was tested, since it would be highly intrusive in the routing service of the tested VANET. This is particularly relevant since we considered a scenario with lower bounds to all requirements that could a priori avoid ECDSA to succeed. High-end CPUs, such as the ones used in personal computers, would allow a much higher number of validations and would be sustainable for the evaluated scenario, but such CPUs are not the ones commonly found in VANETs [17,25], neither they are a plausible option in our case. Furthermore, although powerful hardware could solve the ECDSA validation capability problem, we need to keep in mind that the workload of beacons’ authentication cannot rise above a limit that compromises all other services, such as the routing itself. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we evaluated the impact of authenticating WAVE messages according to IEEE 1609.2. Our evaluation focused in one particular VANET service, IP routing, and only in the authentication of the service’s control plane messages (beacons). For the evaluation we used mobility and communication traces captured from a city-scale VANET, we considered actual devices operating in that VANET and the best performance of multiple ECDSA implementations. We identified new and lower operational requirements where the computational overhead imposed by the ECDSA validation is a clear bottleneck for the communication process, with relevant consequences to the application using this validation. The obtained results reveal that, even with low demanding requirements, as the ones found in a sparse VANET, following IEEE 1609.2 would have a significant negative impact in the VANET’s routing service. Since this is a non-safety service, other solutions, such as using symmetric group shared keys (e.g., [46]), may be a better alternative than ECDSA to provide source authentication. Finally, the performance figures that we have calculated for ECDSA validations can be used in the future for evaluating the performance of protocols requiring vehicles’ authentication, such as fast electric charging of electric vehicles [47].

All rights reserved.A key characteristic of Smart Cities is the ability to reduce conflicts between different agents coexisting in a dynamic system, such as vehicles and pedestrians. This paper describes a system to augment the awareness of vehicle drivers regarding the presence of pedestrians in nearby crosswalks. To address this need, the system interconnects crosswalks to Road Side Units (RSUs), and RSUs to vehicles, in order to spread to vehicles the information about pedestrians in crosswalks. To prevent false information spreading, RSUs authenticate the alert messages they broadcast and all vehicles can validate them. This poses strong security requirements, such as non-repudiation of alert messages, as well as strong real-time requirements, such as minimum message propagation delays among vehicles approaching a crosswalk of interest. Because of this, the system minimizes the usage of asymmetric ciphers, which are fundamental to assure non-repudiation but increase performance penalties, and uses mostly symmetric ciphers for source authentication. To do so, we designed a new protocol, called Nimble Asymmetric Cryptography (NAC), which is useful to broadcast authenticated, implicit messages.",

The tracking system preserves the privacy of passengers, since no centrally stored raw data has any device-specific information. We deployed a prototype of the system in a bus of Porto’s public transportation network, which along several months collected 165161 passengers’ OD locations. A posterior analysis of the data gathered revealed the presence of false positives, which required the enforcement of filtering procedures in order to get values that are more reasonable for extracting relevant OD information.

Within technology, we include research, development, and manufacturing, as well as maintenance and maintainability. Various studies have indicated that for many large systems or pieces of equipment, maintenance and support account for as much as 60 to 75 percent of their overall life cycle costs, and sometimes much more. This is probably why there is an increasing emphasis on maintainability during product design. But even though the first book on maintainability, Electronic Maintainability, appeared in 1960, there are still only a handful of books available on the subject. In recent years, many new concepts and techniques have been developed to meet the challenges of maintaining modern engineering systems. A professional needing information on these developments generally faces a great deal of difficulty and inconvenience, because they are generally discussed in various technical papers and in specialized books but have not been treated within the framework of a single volume on maintainability. This book is an attempt to present both traditional and modern maintainability concepts in a single volume to meet the challenges of modern system design. Every effort was made to treat the topics discussed in such a manner that the reader will need minimum previous knowledge to understand the contents. If the reader desires to delve deeper into a specific area, references provide the sources of most of the material presented. Furthermore, the volume contains numerous examples to facilitate understanding of the material, as well as challenging problems to test reader comprehension. Professional engineers, design and maintenance managers, university professors, along with undergraduate and graduate engineering students, should all find this book useful. I am indebted to my friends, colleagues, students, various maintainability professionals, and others for their interest and encouragement throughout this project. I am grateful to Josee Rocheleau for typing the first draft of this book. I also thank my children, Jasmine and Mark, for their patience during this project. Last, but not least, I thank my wife, Rosy, for typing various portions of this book, for her help in proofreading, and for her unending patience. B.S. Dhillon Ph.D. University of Ottawa "

Automated and, whenever needed, manual analysis were used to investigate its entry pages. Specifically, the pages were checked for the existence of an HTTPS site; the correctness of the certificates and their certification chain; coherence between contents of the HTTP and HTTPS sites; redirection between HTTP and HTTPS, HTTP resources fetched through HTTPS, and exploitation of HSTS. A final classification of municipalities was produced and possible determinants for the results were investigated. The general conclusion is that there is still much to be done in order to assure that citizens can communicate securely with all the Portuguese municipalities. Indeed, only 3.6% of the municipalities were considered good in this regard, while 46.1% do not guarantee the minimum conditions. These results seem to be associated with the dimension of the municipalities, although it was also identified the need for additional explanatory factors.",

Vehicles can connect to others, or to the infrastructure, providing an Internet connection. The communication equipment placed inside the vehicles may have multiple network interfaces of diverse technologies, such as IEEE 802.11p/WAVE, IEEE 802.11a/g/n (Wi-Fi) and cellular. For this purpose, multihoming and network coding can be used to provide high bandwidth and reliability to these services, reducing packet losses due to poor wireless signal quality, therefore improving the final Quality-of-Service (QoS). This work evaluates the impact of a Systematic Network Coding (SNC) approach in multihoming when the coding is applied over traffic incoming from multiple technologies, or from a single technology, depending on the entity responsible for the encoding process. The multi-technology architecture proposed in this work will be evaluated using different coding configurations (generation and buffer sizes) and by analyzing its impact on the packet loss recovery ratio. The comparative results show that the multi-technology approach has a better delivery ratio when compared to the single-technology, despite the small impact on the packet delay.",

In this document we present an overview of DETIboot, a comprehensive description of the coding used in the broadcast communication and a detailed performance evaluation in a spacious auditorium. This evaluation did not involve security features to reduce the amount of variables influencing the final results. However, previous experiments allow us to extrapolate a maximum of 5% increase in the download time due to security. On average, it took us 50.1 s to download a 225 MiB Slax Linux over 802.11g, taking on average 15% more time than the theoretical lower bound of our setup (43.4 s).

The rear vehicle presents the images to the driver using a visualization device. The proposed system was evaluated through real vehicular experiments in two distinct scenarios: Urban and highway. Performance studies were focused on delay measurements, re- transmission rate, signal strength and bandwidth consumption related with the traveling speeds and video quality. Results show that the communication delay is higher in the highway scenario, mainly due to the distance between vehicles and the different speeds. However, promising results regarding the maximum delay and the average number of retransmissions foresee important inputs for future services of assisted-driving, in general, and car- overtaking assistance, in particular.",

VANETs have emerged in the last few years and are likely to play a major role in the future for a wide number of applications. Routing is essential for any ad hoc network, thus security strategies for protecting VANETs’ routing are critical. In this paper we present TROPHY (Trustworthy VANET ROuting with grouP autHentication keYs), a set of protocols to manage the authentication of routing messages in a VANET, under highly demanding time conditions, capable of protecting the distribution of routing information, considering the WAVE architecture and the patented routing approach, the Service-Based Layer-2 Routing Protocol. Authorised nodes recursively receive TROPHY messages that allow them to refresh their cryptographic material and keep authentication keys updated across the network. Those messages are epidemically distributed across the network and built such that any node pinpointed as lost or physically compromised will not be able to perform the refreshment using them (and so, are excluded from the routing process). Due to the use of a Key Distribution Centre (KDC), a central entity, where all the cryptographic material is stored, we included a mechanism to recover from any unauthorised physical access and disclosure of all such material at once, without requiring the need of human intervention on devices’ re-setup.",

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a specific case of ad hoc networks where most of the nodes are vehicles. VANETs have emerged in the last few years and are likely to play a major role in the future for a wide number of applications. Routing is essential for any ad hoc network, thus security strategies for protecting VANETs’ routing are critical. In this paper we present TROPHY (Trustworthy VANET ROuting with grouP autHentication keYs), a set of protocols to manage the authentication of routing messages in a VANET, under highly demanding time conditions, capable of protecting the distribution of routing information, considering the WAVE architecture and the patented routing approach, the Service-Based Layer-2 Routing Protocol. Authorised nodes recursively receive TROPHY messages that allow them to refresh their cryptographic material and keep authentication keys updated across the network. Those messages are epidemically distributed across the network and built such that any node pinpointed as lost or physically compromised will not be able to perform the refreshment using them (and so, are excluded from the routing process). Due to the use of a Key Distribution Centre (KDC), a central entity, where all the cryptographic material is stored, we included a mechanism to recover from any unauthorised physical access and disclosure of all such material at once, without requiring the need of human intervention on devices’ re-setup. Keywords Secure routing Group keys Epidemic propagation 1 Introduction Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a class of ad hoc networks that inherit most of the characteristics of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), but still, with enough differences to define a new category by itself [1–3]. VANETs may have hundreds or thousands of nodes equipped with wireless communication capabilities. Most of the nodes are devices carried by vehicles, On Board Units (OBUs), and a relatively small part of the nodes are devices statically placed near roads, equipped with wired communication capabilities, Road Side Units (RSUs). By their very singular nature and requirements, when compared with MANETs [4,5], the academic research community has given an increasingly amount of attention to the topic. Those characteristics have also lead to the creation of VANETs’ specific solutions, such as the Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) architecture [6]. VANETs are intrinsically associated to safety applications due to the possibility of saving human-lives [7]. Nevertheless, besides safety applications, VANETs also support non-safety applications [8] such as comfort applications, which allow passengers to receive contextualised information (e.g. tourist and city leisure information), and interactive entertainment applications, which allow users to interact either with the Internet or among each other (e.g. Web browsing and file sharing) [9]. Routing strategies to support unicast communications among vehicles have being considered in VANETs since a long time [10–12] and are essential to support IP connectivity [13], thus security strategies for protecting VANETs’ routing must be considered essential. However, in the VANETs’ routing context, it is not possible to apply classical techniques, such as handshake-based authentication protocols [1]; therefore, some common security problems, such as availability, secrecy and integrity, do not have a widely accepted solution. The widely accepted WAVE architecture defines a set of complementary and interdependent protocols to operate in a VANET environment [6,14]. The IEEE 1609.2 [15] standard defines methods and formats of secure messages. For routing services, the IEEE 1609.2 standard may lead to service deficiencies [16], mainly due to message validation delays caused by asymmetric cryptography; as we will see, this is the case of our target VANET. 1.1 Motivation The main objective of our work is to add security to the routing protocols in VANETs, such as the Veniam’s VANET in Porto, which has more than 600 VANET Units (VUs) [17]. The VUs in operation are somewhat limited, in both memory and CPU, when compared with an average personal computer, and the impact of asymmetric cryptographic operations, such as the ones conceived for WAVE, is not negligible. This VANET uses a routing protocol named Service-Based Layer-2 Routing Protocol (SB2RP) [18], which was designed to work under very strict time constraints while providing Internet access to passengers in buses. Such constraints made us decide for the use of symmetric cryptography and network-wide authentication keys to tackle the authentication of legitimate traffic. The use of network-wide authentication keys raises several management issues, namely keys must be refreshed after a specific time of use, to prevent their cryptanalysis, and there must be a solution to deal with the leakage of such keys upon the compromise of one or more VUs. For that purpose, we developed Trustworthy VANET ROuting with grouP autHentication keYs (TROPHY), a set of protocols to manage the distribution of authentication keys among authorised VUs in the VANET. Furthermore, we decided not to add a new independent set of protocols to the existing ones in the VANET, but rather to piggyback TROPHY messages within the already existent routing messages. Although the connectivity of a VANET, especially OBUs’ connectivity, can be complemented with other technologies, such as cellular networks, we focus on making our solution only dependent of the ad hoc network. 1.2 Contributions We assume that there are two types of candidates to participate in the routing process, authorised and unauthorised ones. Unauthorised devices shall not interfere in the VANET routing process, while authorised ones are all those that were initially prepared to operate in the VANET. It is assumed that all the authorised devices work properly. Within the unauthorised, we have all the devices not belonging to the VANET, as well as any device previously authorised but after some date pinpointed as lost or physically compromised. Consequently, we seek to authenticate all routing messages in order to defeat any adversary with the aim to modify or destroy the routing process and full capabilities to eavesdrop, store, modify and transmit an arbitrary number of valid messages. Moreover, we seek to provide mechanisms to overcome attackers with the power to get physical access to one or more devices and all the cryptographic material stored on them, as well as mechanisms to recover from the disclosure of all cryptographic material stored on a central server. The main contribution of this article is the specification and evaluation of TROPHY, a set of protocols to manage the authentication of routing messages in a VANET. TROPHY honours the real and well-defined requirements of our target VANET and does not destroy its original routing strategy by excessively consuming time or resources. More specially, the characteristics of TROPHY are the following: • To operate under highly restrictive time conditions, especially in a large group of limited computational devices, and to be able to protect the distribution of routing information from external attackers, TROPHY uses symmetric cryptography in the most frequent operations. • To recover from the real possibility of any of the devices to get stolen, lost, damaged or becoming suspicious, TROPHY relies on the logical arrangement of the devices and several symmetric group keys in a binary tree structure, in order to exclude any set of nodes at any time with a relatively small quantity of information exchanged in the network. • To mitigate the impact of an arbitrary number of compromised nodes deployed in a large area and uncontrolled environment, TROPHY makes use of a Key Distribution Centre (KDC) to control all the critical processes, as well as to store all the associated sensitive data. • To minimise the needs of direct contact by the devices with the central entity, TROPHY enforces that the messages produced by the KDC can be shared among devices without requiring a mutual trust among them. • To maximise the effective rate of exchanged information among devices with sporadic and highly volatile connections, TROPHY uses handshakeless communications, with its messages piggybacked, on a needed basis, in the routing protocol messages. • To be resilient to the disclosure of all the essential content kept the KDC at once, TROPHY is prepared to recover without requiring the need of human intervention on each of the devices for their re-setup. The results obtained with trace-based emulations using real information samples show that authorised routing messages can be authenticated with Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and a relatively small number of messages signed by a KDC. Moreover, the results show that an epidemic propagation (among the OBUs) of the messages produced by the KDC can, efficiently and on a needed basis, update hundreds of devices in service in a area of approximately 400km2, with a minimal intervention of the KDC and the RSUs. This article is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the context where TROPHY will operate. Section 3 provides a high-level overview of different approaches to transmit secure messages in VANETs and an overview of different strategies to manage group keys. Section 4 describes the proposed architecture of our solution. Section 5 contextualises the tests scenarios and aggregates the correspondent results. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 2 Context Our work is based on Veniam’s VANET and its characteristics, currently deployed in Porto city, Portugal. In our scenario, both OBUs and RSUs are devices with the same hardware and exactly the same computational power. They are the 4th generation of hardware used by the company in real scenarios, equipped with an ARM Cortex-A7 CPU (i.MX 6 at 800MHz) and running a Linux kernel to support a small set of tools. The time needed to verify a signature using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with 224 bits is about 5.7 milliseconds. Alternative scenarios, with computationally more powerful RSUs, were not considered. From the point of view of an ad hoc network, the routing strategy in VANETs has to deal with some new challenges, even when compared with MANETs [19,20]. The routing strategy in use, SB2RP, was developed to face all the challenges found during its deployment. The strategy relies on both V2I and V2V communications to create IP routes between the OBUs and the RSUs; those routes can be either directly or indirectly through multiple hops (RSUs have IP-based communication with an infrastructure). SB2RP is a WAVE application associated to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) data link layer (layer 2) that implements a periodic distance-vector routing algorithm to route between the infrastructure and the VANET (communication to and from the infrastructure). Besides the operation on the OSI layer 2, SB2RP has direct access to the routing tables of IP, associated to the OSI Layer 3. The routing service is identified by a Provider Service Identifier (PSID) and the messages are broadcasted according to the WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) in periods of 100 milliseconds. The relevant information for this work exchanged in those beacons is: the Global Positioning System (GPS) information, the local time, and the routing information. Each VU stores the information received on the SB2RP messages for each of the neighbours in an auxiliary table. Each time a new SB2RP message is received, any older information related with the same origin is replaced. All the entries on the auxiliary table are removed if older than 1.5 seconds. The IP routing tables are updated, conditionally to the neighbours in a range of 3 hops, in periods of 1 second, upon the information stored on the auxiliary table. This is possible due to a direct relation between the identification of the VU and the IP address of that VU. SB2RP does not have into consideration any security aspects. However, SB2RP may filter out incoming routing messages based on their time stamp (too different from the local one), GPS position (too far away) or any other parameter, before using them to update the routing tables. The algorithms proposed on the IEEE 1609.2 standard are not compatible with the operation mode of SB2RP. This incompatibility can be deduced by taking as reference the time needed for the verification of a signature using ECDSA and the 100 milliseconds period to exchange routing information. Due to the time-related constraints, this incompatibility is extended to all the strategies based on similar asymmetric cryptographic primitives. The use of 100% of the CPU, or even 50%, to validate routing messages is not acceptable, and still it would just be possible to validate 17 or 8 messages per 100 milliseconds. Moreover, SB2RP would be highly susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Although the computational limitation presented is related with the specific hardware actually in use, especially its CPU and the absence of a cryptoprocessor, this limitation is not exclusive from our target hardware, but rather common to alternative devices designed to operate in VANETs [21]. Notably, in the EVITA project [22], Wolf et al. [23] developed a vehicular hardware-accelerated security module where a 256-bit ECDSA verification takes 2.2 ms. Moreover, the use of IEEE 1609.2 is not only time-consuming in terms of signature verification, but also bandwidth-consuming due to the appended signature and certificate [24–26], since each secure beacon must always be sent with a signature and the sender certificate [15]. Using implicit certificates, the shortest type of certificates allowed in the standard [15], and considering ECDSA with 224 bits, each beacon has 84 extra bytes [27] plus certification information. For the same level of security strength [28] our MAC has only 16 bytes. 3 Related work The WAVE architecture [6] allows the transmission of secure messages based on the IEEE 1609.2 standard [15], which for authentication relies on ECDSA asymmetric signatures. As previously referred, we did not follow this standard since the use of ECDSA, to sign each routing message, would be a serious limitation to the number of processed messages. Furthermore, the signature of a percentage of them would end up on a non-deterministic behaviour, and the production of one signature for groups of more than one routing message, would create critical time and contextual dependencies between the mobile nodes. The limitations imposed by ECDSA (asymmetric primitives in general) are not only associated to IEEE 1609.2 but rather common to Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), such as the one proposed by Carter et al. [29]. In our solution we do not use asymmetric primitives to authenticate the messages exchanged among VUs and the KDC replaces the PKI. Nevertheless, we use the ECDSA to authenticate, in the VUs, some messages produced by the KDC. In this case, the time needed to produce the signature is not critical, since it is done sporadically by a distinct and powerful machine, neither it is the time needed to validate the signature in VUs, due to the sparse periods of this process. With a focus on broadcast authentication, Perrig et al. [30] [31] proposed a solution where asymmetry is obtained based on time synchronisation and successive disclosure of keys in well determined periods. In short, the sender first sends a message with a MAC, and it later discloses the key and starts using a new one. With the message, the MAC and later the key, any receiver can validate the MAC. Assuming time synchronisation between the participants, with the use of one-way functions it is possible to ensure that a disclosed key is not a valid key to create new MACs. Some variations were created for specific scenarios, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [32] and VANETs [16], but none was used in the routing context. The variation proposed by Studer et al. [16] has in common with our solution the goal to avoid the digital asymmetric signatures associated to the WAVE architecture due to time related constraints. However, this solution needs a large number of keys being stored in each device, the same number of keys as the number of devices in the VANET. Moreover, due to the use of a pre-computed chain of values resultant from a one-way function, all the devices need to be loaded periodically with a new chain and a public starting point of the chain of all the other devices. In our case, we have a small number of keys stored in each device, and there is no need for periodic, global and synchronised re-setups in all the devices. Ahmed et al. [33] and Wagan et al. [34] presented two distinct solutions based on the geographical division of the region accessible by the OBUs into smaller areas. The division can be recursive, so, the smaller areas can be, by their own, divided into even smaller areas. Both proposals, also due to time related constrains, have as goal to avoid the digital asymmetric signatures associated to the WAVE architecture. In each area, there is one or more RSUs or a group leader elected among OBUs, responsible for the registration and the delivery of the correspondent keys and certificates to the new OBUs entering the area. Both solutions make use of symmetric cryptography to speed up the message authentication for high priority emergency messages [33] or for communications inside a small area [34]. Besides the use of symmetric cryptography, in an abstract way, there is another common idea between these two proposed architectures and our own: the use of a hierarchy to facilitate the management of the VANET, regarding the distribution of new cryptographic material. However, instead of groups associated to a geographical area, we have groups based on a virtual, geographical-independent hierarchy, where OBUs are free to be dispersed among the available region and use a common symmetric key for the entire region. Instead of a dependence on the geographical area, we have a dependence on time, so, the key associated to the authentication of routing messages is different from time to time and not from local to local. With a time-dependent process, in which there is a different routing key for different time periods, we need a mechanism to timely distribute new security-relevant information to all the devices in a wide area, otherwise they will be unable to communicate among each other. We considered an epidemic distribution process, that in VANETs has received quite some attention in the past and was mainly being investigated for distributing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) [35–37]. However, unlike the distribution of the CRLs, we distribute information that will invalidate an old key and generate a new key. Another difference is the fact that to exclude devices, instead of a unique CRL that has to be received by all the non-excluded devices, we distribute to the VANET multiple and independent messages. Therefore, each of the non-excluded devices will just need a single message to update itself (even if it can collect and redistribute all the other messages to the global benefit of the VANET). In addition, by the symmetric nature of the key, to prevent its cryptanalysis we need to update it and not only when devices need to be excluded (as with CRLs). 3.1 Group keys A group key is a cryptographic key shared among a group of entities. All entities with access to the group key can use it to encrypt or authenticate (and perform the respectively reverse operation) all the transmitted messages among them via an insecure channel, following a one-to-many or a many-to-many paradigm. The topic of group keys started to receive attention from network researchers in late 1990s, due to the prediction of future needs related with multicast services based on group communications model [38–41], e.g. teleconference, information services. According to the architecture in use, group key management is currently classified according to three main approaches [42–47]: Centralised: There is a single entity responsible for the management of the group. Decentralised: There are multiple entities responsible for the management of subgroups of the main group. Distributed or contributory: There is no central neither decentralised entity. The members of a group are responsible for the management. They can contribute to the computations or elect (be elected by) any of the peers to perform such task. Considering our well-defined scenario, the centralised approach is the one that best fits our requirements. Therefore, we will focus our analysis on the different approaches within the centralised category. Under a centralised architecture, the creation and revocation of keys are responsibility of a single entity, a KDC. A group key distribution protocol is used to make available to all the members of a group the needed secret key, or keys. Relatively to the centralised category, we did not focus on schemes based solely on pairwise keys, where the KDC and each of the V members of the group only share an individual secret and the distribution of a new key always relies on V rekeying messages [38]. Nevertheless, we used pairwise keys for dealing with special circumstances (see Section 4.2.2). Excluding the schemes exclusively based on pairwise key schemes, all the rest of the centralised approaches fall into a hierarchical organization, based on graphs, and trees as a specific case (See Fig. 1 ). On this type of organization, group members, at the lowest level, have a collection of keys: all the keys in the path from the lowest node until the root node. In Fig. 1 the group key is k 1234. The other keys are used to distribute the new keys. For example, if ciphered with k 1234, a new key is available for all the members, but when ciphered with k 12 it is just available to u 1 and u 2. Graphs in which two vertices are connected by more than one path are rarely used in literature; and when they are, the authors end up removing some paths and getting better results with the resultant trees [41]. Although we do not consider schemes based solely on pairwise keys, tree-based hierarchies guarantee that there is a key shared exclusively between each node and the KDC, so one of the options available (though not the only one) is a pairwise key. Tree-based hierarchies were independently proposed by Wong et al. [41] and D. Wallner et al. [39]. Before these proposals, according to Wong et al. [41], “no one has addressed the need for frequent key changes and the associated scalability problem for a very large group” with a globally shared group key. Those initial works have been proposed with wired connections, multicast and a one-to-many communication paradigm in mind. This is a crucial difference, since the characteristics of ad hoc networks, VANETs in special, create additional challenges [44,48]. Moreover, since we are using the group key to authenticate messages between members and not to guarantee the secrecy of any data, we can relax our needs on the so-called backward secrecy [49,50]. Wong et al. [41] formalises three types of strategies to update the keys on members: User-Oriented: where each member receives a specific single message with the new keys, ciphered with a key held by the members. Key-Oriented: where each of the new keys are ciphered individually, and so, members may need more than one message. Group-Oriented: where all messages are concatenated in a single message, sent to all members, which will later select the needed keys. Key-Oriented and Group-Oriented imply that all members need to receive more than one message or a relatively big message, respectively, thus they are not suitable for our scenario. We followed a hybrid model, using a User-Oriented strategy in a minor number of cases, and an approach that takes the best of both User-Oriented and the Key-Oriented strategies. The majority of the key updates are performed building a relatively small number of ciphered messages, where all members will find one that can decipher, and use the content to update (refresh) all keys. An update method, based on a refreshment, called synchro-difference, was firstly proposed by Zhu [51], where instead of distributing new keys, it is distributed a single key update used by the members to produce all the new keys. The distributed key update contains a common difference between the old key and the new one to be produced. Taking the tree in the right hand size of Fig. 1 as example, if u 4 is compromised, in a User-Oriented strategy, u 1 and u 2 would receive the same message with the new k 1234 ciphered with the k 12, and u 3 receives a distinct message with both k 1234 and k 34 ciphered with k 3. In a Key-Oriented strategy, u 1 and u 2 would receive the same message, but u 3 needs 2 messages: one with the new k 34 ciphered with k 3, and another with the new k 1234 ciphered with the new k 34. With a synchro-difference, u 1 and u 2 would receive some random value ciphered with k 12, and u 3 would receive the same random value ciphered with k 3. Each of the new keys is produced based on a bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) of the old key and the received random value. Canetti et al. [52] presented a different way to reduce the overhead of messages in the network. Instead of a key update used to generate all new keys, it is used a one-way function, H(x), to give to the different members the results of different number of chained iterations over the one-way function. Each of the members can then compute all the keys it is entitled to have. The authors give only as example the exclusion of only one member, although it is possible to generalise the strategy and conclude that the exclusion of multiple members at once can only be endured by the successive exclusion of one at a time. Based on a synchro-difference, we can exclude multiple members at once. Sherman et al. [53] extended the idea of Canetti et al. [52] from a one-way function to one-way trees, also known as Merkle trees [54]. A solution based on one-way trees allows multiple exclusions at a time, but needs the management and distribution of an extra value associated to each of the nodes, a so-called blind key. The blind key is built upon the secret key of the sibling of each node. By sibling, we mean the node that shares the same ascendant. This enables each node to calculate the common ascendant without breaking the secrecy of its sibling’s secret key. Perrig et al. [55] presented a work focused on “secure media broadcast over the internet” where the KDC and all members have synchronised time and where both can, in some occasions, independently update the keys in well-defined periods. This can be seen as a virtual distribution protocol of the new keys, where no messages need to be sent between entities. In common with this idea, we have the notion of periodic updates, but in our case, with an explicit distribution of new messages. The idea of synchronisation with no messages was initially attractive and considered, but we concluded that an epidemic propagation of the key updates would be a better way to fit our requirements, since with it we are not dependent on scheduled events that may occur in a different context in the future. Dini et al. [56] proposed the use of one-way functions to provide self-authenticated, key-oriented updates for efficient key revocation, avoiding the use of digital signatures in update messages. A key k can be obtained by k = H ( k n x t ) , where H(x) is a one-way function and knxt is the next key received on a ciphered message. With this approach, each member can test the newly received key, which was delivery ciphered but without any type of signature. However, to the best of our knowledge, this cannot be applied along with our method where we send a difference to all keys of the next generation. Thus, using Key-Oriented updates to have benefit of this strategy was not considered worthy. Perrig et al. [55], Ng et al. [57] and Park et al. [58] proposed different hierarchical schemes based on unbalanced and dynamic balanced trees, with the aim to constantly optimise the structure according to the volatile number of members. In contrast, we use a static and permanently balanced tree, prepared to accommodate a pre-defined large number of members. Instead of rearranging the tree structure each time new members join or leave the group, we use a strategy, with negligible effect in both storage and processing needs, to identify the impact of these actions on the pre-accommodated nodes and consider only their existence on a needed basis. Thus, we end up with the same benefits as if the tree was being constantly re-balanced. 4 Architecture The TROPHY architecture is influenced by multiple trade-offs related with the acceptable overhead, costs and complexity (both human-related and computational) introduced by extra policies and protocol layers, and correspondent effectiveness. Since VANETs may contain thousands of devices, we focused in minimising the need for individual intervention along the time in each device, as well as restrict the impact that actions associated to one device may have among all the others. Moreover, the real time requirements of the routing protocol in operation, allied to the available hardware, limited the use of asymmetric cryptographic primitives. Considering all this, we started by designing an architecture based on a shared group identity. By shared group identity, we mean that members will not recognise each other by their individual identity but rather by a global, common identity. With a shared group identity, we can clearly distinguish between authorised and unauthorised group members, and so, we started by exploring an authentication mechanism among authorised group members based on symmetric cryptographic primitives. Due to the vulnerabilities associated to such approach, especially if any of the members is captured by an attacker or simply lost, we considered that neither an individual member nor a subgroup of members should be in charge of any aspect related with the control of the group identity (e.g. decide who must be included or excluded from the group). Therefore, a distinct, unique and centralised entity was introduced to take this responsibility, the KDC. Such entity stores and controls the shared group identity as well as each of the members’ identity. The introduction of the KDC raised new trade-offs by its own, mainly associated to the security of the stored data and the transmission of new information to each of the members. If, from one hand, a fast transmission of information would be beneficial for the global state of the VANET, from the other hand, the ad hoc infrastructure may not guarantee such requirement, and so, costly solutions could have to be introduced, e.g. the use of cellular networks. To avoid costly solutions and assuming that the ad hoc infrastructure cannot guarantee a fast transmission of information for all the members, neither should it be flooded to achieve such goal, we followed the approach of an opportunistic and epidemic propagation. With this approach members receive new information according to a best effort policy followed by all the VANET members, without the need of mutual trust among any members. Thus, symmetric cryptography is used to authenticate messages exchanged among members and asymmetric cryptography is used to sign contents produced by the KDC. In the best effort policy are considered both individual computational resources and global bandwidth consumption. Computational resources’ consumption is reduced due to the extensive use of symmetric cryptography, while the impact of both asymmetric cryptography in members and bandwidth consumption in the network can be dynamically adjusted through the KDC by updating and disseminating the parameters that influence the best effort policy. Since the shared group identity is at risk if any member gets physically compromised, with the benefits of a centralised entity, the KDC, we implemented a mechanism to efficiently exclude any set of members while updating the shared group identity only to the remaining trusted ones. Moreover, we complemented TROPHY with a mechanism to recover from an attack to the KDC and consequent disclosure of all the information related with the control of both group and members’ identity. The next subsections detail the proposed approach. 4.1 Overview In detail, TROPHY architecture has 4 entities: a KDC, its human operator, the OBUs and the RSUs. We may indistinctly mention both OBUs and RSUs as a single entity, the VUs. The KDC is responsible for creating, updating, and periodically initiating the distribution of messages needed to maintain the routing authentication process valid across the network. The KDC was prepared to interact with a human operator, to setup the network as well as to update some parameters based on decisions taken during its operation. All the orders produced by the KDC are initially sent in messages to one or more RSUs, and then disseminated by all of them to all the others, following an opportunistic and epidemic approach. All the TROPHY messages are piggybacked in the messages of the routing protocol in operation, SB2RP 1 1 Since SB2RP uses WSMP messages that can be transmitted in any of the WAVE channels [8], TROPHY itself is agnostic to the channel in use. . Taking this in consideration, we focused in the creation of small messages. Besides making the messages small in the number of bytes, we also focused in reducing the number of occurrences of all those messages. 4.2 Interaction between entities The human operator can, at any time, include or exclude new VUs, as well as to reconfigure some network-wide parameters in the KDC. After the initial setup of VUs by a human operator, the routing process is initiated on those VUs. The routing messages exchanged between VUs, known as beacons, are authenticated with a MAC created with the routing key, ρ, a symmetric key shared by all VUs. The routing key is periodically refreshed by the KDC to anticipate its potential cryptanalysis, given the high number of MACs that may be created with the same key during the VANET operation. Furthermore, if one or more VUs are pinpointed as lost or physically compromised, the human operator can immediately launch a key refreshment to prevent the exploitation of a possible leaked routing key. The refreshment process is also used to exclude the compromised VUs thereafter from the VANET’s routing (the VUs to exclude are not involved in the key refreshment process). When we mention ρ, we mention the routing key without taking in consideration a specific refreshment associated to a time interval. The multiple refreshments of ρ create a sequence of values identifiable as ρ ( 1 ) , ρ ( 2 ) , ρ ( 3 ) , … , ρ ( t − 1 ) , ρ ( t ) , ρ ( t + 1 ) . The time for the key updates in the VANET is controlled by the KDC under the form of time intervals with consecutive indexes. The time intervals are associated to the real time of the KDC, and each of the intervals may have a different duration. Each VU uses the most recent index to compare itself with the rest of the VANET, e.g. if a VU with ρ(t) receives an update message associated to t + 2 , it can deduce that an update message associated to t + 1 already circulated in the VANET. If otherwise we had updates with absolute time-stamps, the VUs could not take conclusions about the existence of any other intermediate updates between them unless there was a well-defined period for the KDC to release new updates. However, strictly periodic updates would prevent arbitrary update decisions, and so, are not desirable. For this reason, even with the absolute time present in beacons and available for routing decisions based on minimum clock synchronisation between VUs, the update of ρ in the VANET is not dependent on it. The VUs may have different versions of ρ as their most recent routing key. Each VU will always use the most recent version of ρ to create and validate MACs. Beacons are only used to update the routing information if they have a valid MAC computed with the most recent version of ρ present on the receiver. Beacons with valid MACs computed with older versions of ρ are only used to trigger the update process in updated neighbours. On each VU, the most recent version of ρ is also used to create and verify MACs for all the exchanged IP packets being routed. During the reception of the packets, they are discarded if the MAC is invalid or associated with an old version of ρ. 4.2.1 Epidemic propagation of key refreshments The refreshment of ρ is performed based on a refreshment update, r(t), sent by the KDC to the VANET. Such updates are signed by the KDC with its private, asymmetric key, and all VUs can validate the signature with the correspondent public key that was initially preloaded. The signed refreshment update, together with some auxiliary information, forms a refreshment message. The signature of refreshment messages by the KDC and the validation of such signatures by VUs are the only parts of the process requiring asymmetric cryptography. Refreshment messages are associated to a specific time interval, t, and always have as first destination the RSUs. For the same time interval t, there may exist one or more distinct refreshment messages and each message carries this distinct number on it. RSUs periodically contact the KDC and receive the new messages, if any. From RSUs, the refreshment messages are redistributed to all OBUs within beacons. After receiving a refreshment message, OBUs can redistribute it to all neighbour OBUs, in the exactly same way the RSUs initially did. This way, we have an epidemic propagation of the refreshment messages, where VUs do not have to trust on each other to receive and validate contents created by KDC. Moreover, we have a process completely controlled by KDC (which decides when updates need to occur), whereas most of the work is delegated to VUs, following a best effort approach. In Fig. 2 we have a basic scenario to illustrate the epidemic propagation of the refreshment messages, associated to r(1), and its use to update ρ(0) to ρ(1) in RSUs and OBUs. The epidemic key refreshment is a chained process where VUs can only update its cryptographic material to the last state t, based on the previous state t − 1 . The use of a chained process, instead of a direct replacement, has one main advantage: the same refreshment message can be used to refresh different keys at the same time on different VUs without breaking the secrecy of such keys. This is especially useful since the routing key ρ is not the only symmetric key used in the VANET. In groups of VUs that were not isolated from the VANET, each VU has the required routing key to create MACs for its own beacons and to validate the ones received from neighbours. We considered a VU isolated if, in case of an OBU, it moves out of the VANET coverage area or if it is simply powered off and unable to communicate with other VUs for some period. Notably, parked vehicles are not a cause of isolation, since OBUs can still operate and interact with the VANET when parked [37,59]. After an isolation period, a VU may be required to engage on a specific key update before being able to participate again on the routing process with its neighbours. Such key update is supported by updated neighbouring VUs, based on an historical cache of the last refreshment messages stored on such neighbours. The size of the cache, h, is measured in time intervals and is controlled by the KDC. Any updated VU can contribute to the update of a peer, by sending cached information previously received. To improve the spreading of all the distinct refreshment messages across the VANET, each VU includes in its beacons the status, either complete or not, of its historical cache. If all the VUs are updated, but some have their historical cache incomplete, neighbours can detect the situation and append to its next beacon a refreshment message from its cache, selected randomly. Based on the incompleteness of the neighbours, VUs can append refreshment messages to a limited percentage of the transmitted beacons, instead of doing it for all of them. This percentage, the basal refreshment rate, brr, is defined by the KDC and is the same for all VUs. Along with a new refreshment, the KDC can redefine brr. Unfortunately, an isolated VU remains unable to participate on the routing process when none of the neighbours has the needed refreshment messages on their historical cache. This calls for an alternative method to deal with this extreme situation. 4.2.2 Fallback after a period of isolation If one VU is isolated or powered off, it may lose one or more refreshment messages. Furthermore, the VU can be explicitly isolated by the KDC. Mainly because of the first case, a fallback method is necessary to update its routing key, since it is desirable that the VU reengages on the routing process. On the second case, the isolation must be honoured, and the fallback must only work after some explicit decision that cancels the previous state of isolation. The RSUs can directly exchange messages with the KDC at any time; so, if allowed, an RSU can easily recover the last state of the cryptographic material of the VANET. The OBUs, on the other hand, do not have such possibility. If an OBU cannot be updated by the content on the historical cache of its neighbours, it can use an RSU as proxy to request a specific message to synchronise its routing key with the value present in the KDC. These requests, sync message requests, contain the last time interval known by the OBU, and 2 MACs, one created with ρ and the other one created with a key, ϵ, shared only by the KDC and the OBU. The first MAC can be used to filter requests on RSUs. The second is used to authenticate the OBU in the KDC. The replies, sync message replies, contain all the keys for the VU, encrypted with an ϵ and signed by the KDC. In Fig. 3 we illustrate this protocol, where neither the OBU nor the KDC have to trust on the intermediate RSU. After a period of isolation, and upon detecting an RSU, an OBU ν appends to its beacon a sync request, Rν , which will be sent to the KDC by an RSU. After receiving a sync reply, Uν (t), the RSU will append it to its next beacon. The sync reply will be available to all the neighbours of the RSU, but can only be decrypted by the OBU ν. All the neighbours of the RSU also resend Uν (t), appending it to a beacon. If ν gets out of range of the RSU during the time to process the reply in the KDC, it may still be able to receive Uν (t) by an intermediate OBU. The resending process only occurs when Uν (t) comes from an RSU and not when it comes from an OBU. In the case of RSUs, the process is similar, but simpler, since there is no need of any intermediate entity. RSUs can do their own update requests and this is not visible by the neighbours, since there is no impact on transmitted beacons. When receiving a beacon with a sync request appended and a MAC created with an older ρ ( ρ ( t − n ) in Fig. 3), the RSU may or may not have such old ρ version. The verification of the MAC by the RSU is not mandatory; it may be only performed when instructed by the KDC to do so (e. g. upon starting receiving invalid sync requests). In case this validation is needed, if the old value of ρ is not present in the RSU, the value is sent by the KDC. 4.2.3 Human operator and VANET The human operator can control the VANET through the KDC. Some operational parameters can be redefined to fit new requirements: Default refreshment period: Although refreshments can be sent to VANET at any time, we enforce a minimum period if no action is taken by the operator. Historical cache size: h, the limit for the old refreshments stored on VUs (see Section 4.2.1). This value is always sent along with all the new refreshment messages. Basal refreshment rate: brr, the percentage of beacons that can carry a refreshment message for updating neighbours with an incomplete cache (see Section 4.2.1). This value is sent along within refreshment messages. Complementary, some actions can be taken to manage the VANET: Include new VUs: The cryptographic material is loaded from the KDC to the device. This is transparent to the rest of the VANET and does not trigger any new refreshment. Exclude compromised VUs: The exclusion of VUs immediately triggers a new refreshment of the VANET keys (see Section 4.3.1). Resurrect compromised VUs: In the KDC a new exclusive key ϵ for the VU is generated and stored, and then loaded into the device (see Section 4.3.1). Reset all keys on VANET: In case of all the VANET distribution keys in the KDC got disclosed (a major disaster!) new ones will be generated. Moreover, a reset message is immediately sent to the VANET; it will allow all the VUs to recover without any need of human intervention on its hardware (see Section 4.3.2). This recover is only possible if the private key of the KDC has not been compromised. 4.3 Cryptographic material With the exception of an asymmetric key pair belonging to the KDC, all other keys used in the VANET are symmetric keys. The private key of the KDC is used to sign all the contents sent to the VANET; the public key is preloaded on all its VUs. On Section 4.2 we mentioned a key, the routing key ρ, known by all VUs, used to create and validate MACs of beacons and routed traffic. We also mentioned a key, the exclusive key ϵ, shared by each of the VUs and the KDC, used to exchange secret information between the KDC and each VU. The exclusive keys of all VUs form the set of exclusive keys E. The components of E are initialised with random values (seeds). Those values remain unchangeable along the different time intervals: (1) E ( t + 1 ) = E ( t ) For the secure distribution of the refreshment messages across the VANET, we use n auxiliary group keys, which form the set of group keys G. The components of G are associated to a time interval t: (2) G ( t ) = ⋃ i = 0 n − 1 g ( t ) i For t = 0 , all the components of G are initialised with random values (seeds). The refreshment of all components of G from t to t + 1 is based on a chaining process dependent on the refreshment update r ( t + 1 ) : (3) G ( t + 1 ) = ⋃ i = 0 n − 1 g ( t ) i ⊕ r ( t + 1 ) The two previously mentioned sets, E and G, are both made out of symmetric keys randomly initialised (with seeds). Between the two sets, the only difference is the fact that they are different or the same in distinct time intervals (see Eq. (1) and Eq. (3)). The components of these two sets of symmetric keys are together known as the set of distribution keys S: (4) S = E ∪ G The components of the set S may be used indistinctly but always have its origin well identified. The origin is especially important to maintain the constraint related with the transition between time intervals: (5) S ( t + 1 ) = E ( t ) ∪ ⋃ i = 0 n − 1 g ( t ) i ⊕ r ( t + 1 ) Each VU ν has an ordered subset of S, the subset Pν , with d distribution keys. Each subset Pν is distinct from any other. The subset Pν is built based on p(ν) that selects the elements of S associated to ν. (6) P ( t ) ν = ⋃ ∀ j ∈ { p ( ν ) } s ( t ) j Since the components of S have an identifiable origin, the same happens with the components of P(t) ν . Moreover, it is assured by p(ν) that in each subset P(t) ν : 1. There is one, and only one, component with origin in E; 2. There is one, and only one, common component in all the different subsets. By (1.) we honour the need for the existence of one symmetric key shared only between a VU and the KDC, the exclusive key ϵ ν . By (2.) we associate the routing key ρ(t) to the set G and consequently to S. Note that ρ(t) is a special component of the group keys; although the routing key has a distinct purpose from the group keys (routing authentication and distribution of key updates, respectively), the same key can interchangeably be used for the two purposes. Just as with Eq. (5), all subsets are independently refreshed: (7) P ( t + 1 ) ν = ϵ ν ∪ ⋃ ∀ p ∈ P ( t ) ν ∖ ϵ ν p ⊕ r ( t + 1 ) On each VU, the ordered subset Pν can be represented as an array of d elements. The index 0 contains the routing key, which is the same in all VUs, ρ(t). The index d − 1 contains a distinct key in all the subsets, ϵ ν . All the group keys on Pν (indexes from 0 to d − 2 ) are always associated to the same time interval. Besides all the keys of S, the KDC stores an ordered set of images I of a non-stored set of auxiliary values A. The set I has the same size as E, there is one and only one value associated to each VU. Based on randomly generated auxiliary values, αν for each VU ν, and using a cryptographically secure one-way function, H(x), I is computed as: (8) I = ⋃ ∀ α ∈ A H ( α ) Each VU ν has access to one and only one value of A, αν . After the creation of I, each of the auxiliary values on A is loaded into the correspondent VU, and are discarded from the KDC, which only stores I. 4.3.1 Manipulation and synchronisation The KDC performs two types of operations on distribution keys, S: refreshment of group keys G and replacements of the entire S (E and G) and I. The refreshment of G from t to t + 1 is based on a random value, the refreshment update r ( t + 1 ) . All the components of G in the state t are refreshed with r ( t + 1 ) (see Eq. (5)). With the refreshment update r ( t + 1 ) , each of the VUs can perform the same operation in the correspondent subset Pν , (see Eq. (7)), and keep itself synchronised with the KDC. To secretly distribute r(t), the KDC uses one or more distribution keys (either a group key or an exclusive key) from S ( t − 1 ) to encrypt it and produce the correspondent refreshment message. Each refreshment messages sent to the VANET has an encrypted value of r(t), thus each VU with the correct distribution key on the respective subset Pν is able to decrypt it. To refresh the entire VANET from t to t + 1 , the KDC only needs to send one message, with r ( t + 1 ) encrypted with ρ(t). As ρ is known by all VUs, the refreshment update can be used by all of them. Multiple messages, encrypted with different distribution keys, are used to exclude one or more VUs. If one or more VUs were pinpointed as compromised or lost, part of the distribution keys is considered compromised. Among the compromised keys is always ρ, since it is known by all VUs. In this scenario, neither ρ nor any of the distribution keys present in the subsets Pν of the compromised VUs can be used to encrypt r ( t + 1 ) . With the exception of all the distribution keys associated to the compromised VUs, all the others can be safely used as key to encrypt r ( t + 1 ) and produce refreshment messages. Some of those distribution keys are then used to produce the smallest set of refreshment messages, which is enough to update all but the VUs to exclude. In the KDC, once the excluded VUs are marked as compromised, future requests based on the fallback method (see Section 4.2.2) are ignored. The other type of operation performed by the KDC is the replacement of the exclusive keys on E and images on I, used to re-include any of the compromised VUs. To re-include a VU ν that was compromised at the time interval tc , the exclusive key ϵ ν is replaced by a new random value (seed) associated to the most recent time interval, tr . Besides that, a new αν is randomly generated and the image, iν , in the set I is replaced by a new value i ν = H ( α ν ) . After this, the same device, or a different one, can safely take the identification of ν and be loaded with the new value of ϵ ν , associated to tr , along with the αν (αν is then discarded from KDC). The existence of a seed with a time interval tr greater than tc indicates that the VU was resurrected. Since the compromised version of VU was explicitly excluded from the refreshment process, the newly resurrected VU, with the new ϵ associated to tr , inherits the old context and needs to use the fallback method (see Section 4.2.2) to synchronise its subset of distribution keys P. Since the exclusive key ϵ ν was replaced, the KDC can recognise the messages produced by the resurrected instance of ν, encrypted with the new ϵ ν , and provide the needed data. 4.3.2 Recovering from the disclosure of all the distribution keys Upon a successful attack, the KDC may be compromised and all its distribution keys S disclosed (including ρ and all exclusive keys ϵ). After such an event, the distribution keys no longer guarantee the secrecy of any new data distributed with them. By compromising the KDC, an attacker may also have access to the set of images, I, but this is not relevant. To reset all the keys in all the VUs, the KDC sends a reset message, a special refreshment message (without refreshment key), associated to state t + 1 . At the same time, the KDC replaces all the distribution keys S (both E and G) by new ones associated to t + 2 . On state t + 1 all the VUs are excluded from the chained process (none of them can use refreshment messages), but are allowed (informed!) to reset the subset Pν to t + 2 . The reset is performed based on the fallback method (see Section 4.2.2) with an extra step, which will guarantee the secrecy of the new values being distributed. All the VUs will secretly receive their correspondent subset Pν with the new keys, previously created on state t + 2 . The extra step relies on the set of images I and the correspondent set of auxiliary values A. The set I is stored in the KDC, so also compromised, but the auxiliary values are distributed along the VUs. For each VU ν, the KDC can receive each αν , encrypted with its asymmetric public key, compute H(αν ) and compare it with the correspondent iν of I. Assuming the secrecy of the private key of the KDC, a compromised KDC can recover from the disclosure of all the distribution keys stored on it, because it is possible to distinguish a sync request made by a VU and a sync request made by the attacker that holds E but not the distributed A. The reply from the KDC to each VU ν, instead of being encrypted with the disclosed key ϵ ν , is in this case encrypted with αν . The inclusion of αν encrypted with the KDC public key creates an overhead on the fallback method. Although this step is essential to recover from the disclosure of all the distribution keys, it does not need to be present on the requests that will be made by VUs to recover from a period of isolation. Fortunately, the two scenarios are easy to distinguish because the first one is triggered by a reset message. In case of the KDC being compromised along with some of the VUs, the recovering must be done in two steps: first recover from the disclosure of all the distribution keys, and then the exclusion of the compromised VUs. 4.4 Identification of keys and VUs The distribution keys S are arranged in a complete binary tree structure, where the number of leaves, V, is the maximum number of VUs supported by the KDC. Hereafter, we will assume that the number of VUs is equal to V = 2 v , for any v ∈ N + , unless otherwise stated. Each component of S is associated to a node of the binary tree. On the root node, we have the routing key ρ, on each leaf we have a different exclusive key ϵ (all the elements of E are in the leaf level). The binary tree defines successive binary partitions of the VANET. For each partition, it is given a new and distinct key. Fig. 4 illustrates a scenario for a VANET with a maximum of 4 VUs. Since the binary tree is a complete binary tree, with V leaves, allowing up to V VUs in the VANET, the number of elements of S is 2 · V − 1 , and the number of distribution keys stored in each VU is log 2 ( V ) + 1 . Instead of a tree with V leaves, we represent our tree as a main tree where on each of its leaves (main leaves) we have an inner tree with the same size. Moreover, the main tree and the inner tree have the same number of leaves, l: (9) l = V We use the same indexes for both branch nodes and leaves of the trees. By branch nodes, we mean all the nodes that are not leaves. In a complete binary tree with l leaves, there are l − 1 branch nodes. Fig. 5 illustrates such division for V = 16 and l = 4 . The main tree is composed by 3 branch nodes (blue circles) and 4 leaves (green triangles); each of the leaves of the main tree contains an inner tree composed by 3 branch nodes (orange circles) and 4 leaves (red triangles); the 16 VUs are assigned to the 16 leaves of the 4 inner trees. It is possible to distinguish all the branch nodes with indexes from 0 up to l − 2 . Similarly it is possible to distinguish all the leaves with indexes from 0 up to l − 1 . Based on this, for each tree we can use a variable length code for indexing both branch nodes and leaves, with indexes of branch nodes taking half of the size of indexes of leaf nodes. If the first part is between 0 and l − 2 (different from l − 1 ), the index refers to a branch node, and there is not a second part. If the first part is equal to l − 1 (an invalid index for branch nodes), it indicates that there is a second part, with the index of the leaf. To distinguish between branch nodes and leaves of a single tree, we have a code with 1 or 2 parts. Since we have a main tree and multiple inner trees, to distinguish all the nodes (all the components of S), we have a left-to-right variable code with 1 (branch nodes of main tree), 3 (branch nodes of the inner tree) and 4 (leaf nodes of an inner tree) parts. We do not use the leaf nodes of the main tree alone by their own, so there are no codes with 2 parts. For the example presented in Fig. 5, the variable length codes of the distribution keys are shown in Table 1 . Under all the circumstances, the distribution keys associated to the branch nodes of the main tree are the most used, and the less used are the ones associated to leaf nodes of inner trees; thus, we have a shorter identification for the most used indexes. Although the indexes of the distribution keys associated to VUs (the set E) are composed by 4 parts, to distinguish among VUs, only 2 of those parts contain meaningful information: the indexes of both leaves. Thus, to identify VUs we use an index made out of the concatenation of leaf’s indexes. To all the V VUs, this is coincident with a linear indexing from 0 to V − 1 on all inner leaves. For a VU ν, its index is composed by b = log 2 ( V ) bits, where the most significative half, νh , is the index of the main tree leaf and the lowest significative part, νl , the index of inner tree leaf. The ascendant of any binary tree node x (excluding the root node) is given by: (10) a ( x ) = ⌊ x − 1 2 ⌋ With A(x) defined as a function that, based on a(x), returns the set of all ascendants of node x, B = l − 1 , “|” representing concatenation, all the indexes of the subset Pν , the path from ν up to the root node, are given by: (11) p ( ν ) = p 1 ( ν ) ∪ p 2 ( ν ) ∪ p 3 ( ν ) with: (12) p 1 ( ν ) = B ∣ ν h ∣ B ∣ ν l (13) p 2 ( ν ) = ⋃ ∀ x ∈ A ( ν l + B ) ( B ∣ ν h ∣ x ) (14) p 3 ( ν ) = A ( ν h + B ) P 1(ν) is the index of VU ν. P 2(ν) is the set of indexes of the inner branch nodes above of VU ν. P 3(ν) is the set of indexes of the main branch nodes above of VU ν. 4.4.1 Dealing with an arbitrary number of VUs We assumed until now that the number of VUs is V = 2 n for some positive n. This is a strong assumption and cannot be guaranteed in a real scenario. When handling a smaller number of VUs, assuming that the VANET is always composed by the maximum number would imply that some refreshment messages would be created and sent to the VANET but not used by any of the VUs. This would have a negative impact since VUs would have to process and store useless messages as well as consume bandwidth to exchange them. For an arbitrary number of a VUs, creating s = 2 ⌈ log 2 ( a ) ⌉ continuous partitions of the available V positions on the inner tree leaves, the best distribution is obtained by any arrangement where there is only 1 VU associated to each of the s partitions. When supporting a maximum of 16 VUs, one of the possible distributions of 4 VUs is shown in Fig. 6 . During the inclusion or exclusion of VUs, the flagged nodes may change. If the number of VUs is reduced by half or more, it is not guaranteed that the distribution keeps optimal. In the case of a big reduction of VUs, it may be advised to re-index the active ones. We did not consider the need for re-index the VUs, since on our real scenario such variation is not present neither expected. 4.5 Secure routing To enforce the security of the routing protocol all the beacons are replaced with a secure version, which ensures its integrity. The routing information is the same of the base protocol. Instead of a beacon solely with the routing information, VUs send a beacon with these elements: • Routing information; • Time interval, t, of the most recent routing key ρ; • Extra payload; • State of the historical cache (see Section 4.2.1); • MAC computed with ρ(t). Assuming the secrecy of ρ(t) across VUs, the routing process is protected against external attackers, due to the MAC. To support updates of ρ(t), beacons can carry an extra payload, either refreshment messages, sync messages or reset messages. Both types of messages are associated to a well-defined time interval, and both carry some auxiliary control information for that specific time interval: the number of distinct refreshment messages produced by KDC, the size of the historical cache and the basal refreshment rate, respectively, h and brr. 4.5.1 Refreshment messages The refreshment messages are built by the KDC, according to Fig. 7 , with the goal of secretly distributing a refreshment update r ( t + 1 ) to all or part of the VUs. The refreshment messages are made by: • r ( t + 1 ) encrypted with an element of S(t); • Identification of the element of S(t) used to encrypt r ( t + 1 ) ; • Value of t; • Control information (number of distinct refreshment messages, brr, h); • KDC signature. To distribute r ( t + 1 ) to the entire VANET it is produced only one refreshment message, with r ( t + 1 ) encrypted with ρ. Since ρ is a common entry in all the subsets P, this key is the best candidate to encrypt r ( t + 1 ) . This is enough to protect the VANET against external attackers, unless such attackers had access to ρ. To exclude one or more VUs, the KDC uses the binary tree structure to select a minimum set of safe distribution keys. All the distribution keys present on the subset of any of the VUs to exclude are considered compromised keys. The minimum set of safe keys is built based on all the siblings, not flagged as unused (see Section 4.4.1), of nodes with compromised keys. If there is more than one VU to exclude, from the previous group of selected siblings are excluded the ones that are compromised. After generating multiple refreshment messages for t + 1 , non-excluded VUs will update from ρ(t) to ρ ( t + 1 ) . For t + 2 the KDC will again produce a single refreshment message, using ρ ( t + 1 ) as the only distribution key. This happens because all of the excluded VUs were unable to receive r ( t + 1 ) and update their state to t + 1 , thus, are unable to decrypt any future refreshment messages, and more important, they are unable to create MACs with the most recent ρ ( t + 1 ) present in VANET. With V VUs (see Section 5.2 for results and graphs with V = 2 16 ), the number of distribution keys used to create the refreshment messages to exclude c  >  0 VUs at once, in the worst case, is given by: (15) m w = ⌊ c · ( log 2 ( V ) − log 2 ( c ) ) ⌋ , ∀ 0 < c < V (16) Max ( m w ) = V 2 With a tree structure capable of handling up to V = 2 v VUs, for any v ∈ N + , for an arbitrary number a ≤ V of VUs, with the optimal distribution described in Section 4.4.1 and the existence of flagged nodes, the Eq. (15) has a different, but similar formula: (17) m w = n w + o w , ∀ 0 < c < a ≤ V with: (18) n w = ⌊ c · ( ⌊ log 2 ( a ) ⌋ − log 2 ( c ) ) ⌋ (19) o w = min ( c · log 2 ( x ) , y ) and: (20) x = ⌈ 2 ⌈ log 2 ( a ) ⌉ a ⌉ (21) y = a − 2 ⌊ log 2 ( a ) ⌋ x is the maximum number of VUs associated to the tree nodes on level l a = ⌊ log 2 ( a ) ⌋ of the tree structure in use (assuming the root node as level l = 0 ) and y is the number of the tree nodes that have this maximum number (see Fig. 8 ). The x value is always 1 when a = 2 b for any b ∈ N + or 2, otherwise. Due to this fact, log2(x) is always 0 or 1 and has a small impact on mw . In Section 4.2.1 we mention that refreshment messages are associated to a specific time interval, t. Moreover, they are also associated to a specific distribution key, s(t) x (see Fig. 7). When the KDC produces more than one refreshment message for t, and a VU has multiple refreshment messages, while listing an outdated neighbour, the VU can deduce the specific refreshment message that will update this specific neighbour, due to the relation (based on the tree-structure) between the identification of the neighbour and the distribution key s(t) x . When there are more than one outdated neighbours, and those neighbours need different refreshment messages, the updated VU will randomly select one to send. With this awareness, we improve the speed of the epidemic propagation, since we guarantee that an updated VU will not disregard the needs of all neighbours. 4.5.2 Sync messages The sync messages are exchanged in two different directions, from VUs to the KDC and vice-versa, as requests and replies, respectively. From VUs to the KDC, request messages are made by: • VU identification, ν; • Last time interval, t, known by the VU (the current status of Pν ); • Auxiliary key, αν , encrypted with the public key of the KDC (this is only present after the reception of a reset message, see Section 4.3.2); • MAC of the previous content computed with the last exclusive key, ϵ ν ; • MAC of the previous content computed with the last routing key, ρ(t). and the replies are made out of: • VU identification, ν; • The ordered subset Pν encrypted with ϵ ν or αν (see Section 4.3.2); • Time interval of the encrypted Pν ; • Control information; • KDC signature. 5 Evaluation: results and discussion To evaluate TROPHY we built a trace-based emulator for both OBUs and RSUs that communicate with a KDC, according to a realistic model of a VANET. We also built a prototype of the KDC and prepared it to accommodate up to 216 (65536) VUs. The emulator was fed with 24 hours of traces collected from Veniam’s VANET on Porto city on February 2015, containing 396 OBUs and 50 RSUs. All VUs send periodic beacons in intervals of 100 milliseconds, informing all neighbours about their current state. The data samples have the logged state of all nodes in periods of 2 seconds, including their geographic position and a list of the neighbours listened during the 2 seconds, along with their beacon signal strength. The area used by OBUs is around 21.1 by 18.5 km while the RSUs are mostly placed in the city centre. The area covered by the VANET is shown in Fig. 9 . We implemented the routing protocol used in the VANET (see Section 2) and, based on the lists of the neighbours per VU, we emulated the transmission and reception of routing beacons in periods of 100 milliseconds and enforced their authentication. Furthermore, we emulated the connections made by the RSUs to the KDC and appended to the beacons, on a needed basis, the refreshment messages produced by the KDC as well as the requests for sync messages produced by OBUs and the respective replies produced by KDC. By using real traces with both location and signal strength associated to the received WAVE beacons, we captured the characteristics of the periodic packet-level communications in the VANET. The traces are an outcome that embeds the impact of several transmission issues, such as radio shadowing and MAC (Medium Access Control) collisions; therefore, all mobility, propagation and MAC were taken from real traces, avoiding the use of mathematical models. To evaluate TROPHY in scenarios with worst communication conditions given captured traces, starting from such traces we created a harsh artificial scenario where periodic packet-level communications suffer from severe losses (see Section 5.3.2). While piggybacking TROPHY in the simulated beacons, we are creating differences at the level of the captured MAC layer due to possible channel errors. However, the harsh artificial scenario largely outstrips any possible influence of the piggybacked data in the MAC layer [25,60], and so, the related results represent an extreme lower limit of the performance of TROPHY. 5.1 Input data The collected traces have its origin in a VANET made out of public buses, garbage trucks, and Porto municipality vehicles. Based on the real traces we built two different sets of input for the emulator, one where the VUs communicate with neighbours up to 1 km (the maximum value present in samples) and another one up to 100 metres. For the 100 metres limit nearly 23% less are beacons received. Most of the beacons listened by VUs are received from a neighbour in a near range, as shown in Fig. 10 . The number of active OBUs is variable along the day, with a maximum of 396 and a minimum of 40, as shown in Fig. 11 . While active, the OBUs may be isolated from the VANET. We measured the average time that OBUs are isolated, in minutes per hour. This time is dependent of the data set in use, for communications limited to 1 km it is shown in Fig. 12 . For communications limited to 100 metres, the results followed the same pattern, with the values of isolation time increasing from 0 to 10 minutes. When active, the VUs are exchanging beacons with the neighbours. Since the communications are based on broadcasted messages, without any mechanism to ensure the reception of the messages, the communication created among VUs may not be bidirectional: a VU, ν 1, may be able to listen a neighbour, ν 2, while ν 2 cannot listen ν 1. Since our solution relies on an epidemic propagation of messages according to the needs of the neighbours, the bidirectional communications are important and the presence of unidirectional communications may have a negative impact. The percentage of bidirectional connections created by OBUs and RSUs as well as the discriminated unidirectional connections for RSUs (can listen but cannot be listened or the opposite) are shown in Fig. 13 . It is important to notice that the OBUs can exchange beacons with RSUs and other OBUs while the RSUs only exchange beacons with OBUs. The percentage of unidirectional communications found in the OBUs is between 5% and 10%. In the case of RSUs there is some variation, between 0 and 30%. The time since the last direct connection with an RSU made by the OBUs is shown in Fig. 14 . The analysis of Fig. 11, Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 suggests that approximately from 23: 00 to 6: 00 the VANET may be susceptible to communication problems. The problems may be caused by three different reasons that individually occur for a relatively small period, but all in continuous time window, namely: • A small number of active OBUs, especially from 4: 00 to 5: 00 (see Fig. 11); • A high number of OBUs isolated for a large period, around 5: 00. More than 75% of the active OBUs are isolated more than 30 (non-continuous) minutes during 1 h (see Fig. 12); • A high percentage of unidirectional communicating between RSUs and OBUs, from 1: 00 to 2: 30 and around 23: 00 and 6: 00 (see Fig. 13). 5.2 TROPHY messages: size, number and occurrence To accommodate up to 216 VUs, we have the same number of inner leaves in the KDC, with both main and inner trees having l = 256 leaves (see Eq. (9)). Consequently, in this case, the identification of each VU takes 2 bytes. For the symmetric cipher, we chose the AES128, so the symmetric keys have 16 bytes. We assume the use of HMAC-MD5 as the MAC function, with an output of 16 bytes, and the use of ECDSA, as the asymmetric signature algorithm, more precisely ECDSA-224 with a signature of 56 bytes and a public key with 28 bytes. These technologies were chosen based on the security currently provided,  ≥  112 bits of security strength [28], and the current recommendations for the near future [61], up to 2030. With the best expectations being to use the protocol without any update up to 2030, we use 3 bytes to define the time intervals (the number of minutes up to 2030 is less than 224). Comparing with SB2RP, with the proposed configuration, the routing beacons have extra 20 bytes (16 bytes for the MACs, 3 bytes for the time interval and 1 byte to advertise the state of the historical cache), plus the size of the optional refreshment or sync messages. The 20 bytes increment is independent of the maximum number of VUs supported by TROPHY and only dependent of the algorithm used to produce the MAC and the expected period of continuous work. The refreshment messages have between 80 to 83 bytes and this size is mostly independent of the maximum number of VUs supported. In the refreshment messages the only parameter dependent of (the logarithm of) the maximum number of VUs is the number of distinct refreshment messages present in the control information (see Section 4.5.1). The requests for sync messages sent by the OBUs have 37 or 293 bytes while the replies of sync messages sent by the KDC have 340 bytes. The sync messages are the most dependent from the maximum number of VUs, since in both it is sent the identification of the VUs. Moreover, the replies from KDC have log (V) encrypted keys (with 16 bytes in our case). In Eq. (15) we defined the number of distribution keys, in the worst case, used to create the same number of refreshment messages needed to exclude c out of V VUs. To analyse the behaviour of TROPHY with 216 VUs, we simulated the exclusion of elements and the selection of the distribution keys to update the remaining elements. We simulated the exclusion of c VUs out of 216 (∀c ∈ {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}), strictly following the rules defined in Section 4.5.1: 1. Select the siblings of all the compromised tree nodes; 2. Exclude any sibling that is already compromised. For each value c, we run 100,000 tests: each test consists in randomly compromise c VUs and measure the respective impact, i.e. the number of refreshment messages and the number of VUs that use each of the refreshment messages. For each group of 100,000 tests we computed the maximum and the average number of messages to update 100%, 95%, 75% and 50% of the remaining VUs. We repeated the process 100 times and computed the 95% confidence interval (less than 1 for all the cases). Although all messages produced by the KDC are available in the RSUs and can be distributed to the VANET, the OBUs will not receive all the messages at once. The number of messages needed to update 95%, 75% and 50% of the VANET is an indicator of the usefulness that an OBU with a certain number of cached messages has to the outdated neighbours. The results are shown in Fig. 15 , along with the two theoretical values (dashed lines) to update all and half the VUs, in the worst case. Fig. 15 reveals that the defined values to the worst cases slightly start to diverge from the experimental results, especially for c ≥ 16. This indicates that the predicated worst case is highly unlikely to happen. A more careful analysis, based on the probability of the worst case, is coincident with such results. Since the worst case happens when each of the compromised VUs is uniquely associated to different tree nodes in the higher possible level 2 2 When c=2, the worst case happen when there is 1 compromised VU in the first half (0 - 32767) and another in the second half (32768 - 65535). It means that for c=2 the total space is divided in c=2 continuous partitions with the same size and there is only one compromised VU in each partition. The same happens for c > 2, c partitions with the same size and only 1 compromised VU per partition. , when randomly compromising c VUs out of 216, the probability of the worst case is given by: (22) P ( m w ) = ∏ i = 1 c 2 16 c · ( c − i + 1 ) 2 16 − i + 1 The result of P(mw ) for the different values of c is shown in Table 2 , where it is possible to see the different magnitude of the occurrence of the worst case before and after c = 16 , coincident with the experimental results in Fig. 15. In a VANET with 216 VUs, the exclusion of 256 VUs will mostly result on ≅1900 messages to update all the remaining VUs and ≅143 messages to update half, rather than the previously predicated worst case of 2048 and 256 messages, respectively. Fig. 15 also reveals the relation between the number of messages to update 95% and the entire VANET that is always, at least, twice smaller. This indicates that even when excluding a high number of VUs, even without all the refreshment messages cached, an updated OBU can most probably contribute to update a large amount of neighbours. The number of refreshment messages is heavily dependent on the binary tree used in the KDC. We analysed others n-ary trees at an early stage of this work. Without loss of generality, we consider now the case of 1 exclusion in a VANET with a high number of VUs where the KDC has as base a complete n-ary tree (n ≥ 2) with V leafs. Using a complete n-ary tree, the number of nodes with the same ascendant is n, while the depth of the tree is log n (V). When excluding 1 VU there is 1 path with compromised nodes from the leafs level up to the root node and the number of non-compromised siblings for each of the compromised node in each level of the path is n − 1 . The exclusion of 1 VU consists on creating 1 refreshment message for each of the non-compromised sibling of all the compromised nodes, so, the number of refreshment messages is: m w = log n ( V ) · ( n − 1 ) . For a binary tree ( n = 2 ) and c = 1 , this is coincident with Eq. (15). For the general case, the binary tree is the best structure and yields the best results, since it minimises the expression: log n ( V ) · ( n − 1 ) . In a long period of operation, the most common refreshment messages are the ones associated to key refreshments without exclusions and the ones associated to a small number of exclusions. We assume this since we do not consider plausible a scenario where a VANET operates at the same time it constantly excludes dozens or hundreds of compromised nodes. Considering 216 VUs, and the correspondent 2 17 − 1 nodes of the tree, with the variable length code introduced in Section 4.4 we have l = 256 (see Eq. (9)). Therefore, we use one byte to identify the 255 nodes with the shortest identification (the equivalent to the three topmost nodes in Fig. 5, all in blue) which, in a long period of operation, are the nodes associated to the distribution keys s(t) x most used in the VANET (see Fig. 7). Without the variable length code, all the tree-nodes would be identified by 17 bits. With the variable length code, when excluding a relatively small number of VUs, c < 64, the majority of the remaining VUs will request a refreshment message created with a distribution key s(t) x of one byte. Table 3 shows 3 3 In the worst case, the number of VUs using s(t) x with four bytes is always equal to c. the worst possible case when excluding c VUs, for c ≤ 128. 5.3 Test scenarios We created multiple scenarios to analyse and validate the implemented solution. For those scenarios, we looked for the lower bounds of use and the respective parameters. This goal led to some stressful configurations that are not expected to find equivalent in a real context, but still, are useful for the evaluation. On each scenario, we tested different parameters and in some cases, based on the results, we fixed and carried on with the best parameters to some other test scenarios. The tested scenarios were divided into 5 different groups: fixed periods of refreshment, adverse communication conditions, successive exclusions of a single VU, single exclusion of multiple VUs and reset of all the KDC keys. For each scenario, we evaluated 8 distinct time-dependent parameters, namely: a) Percentage of beacons received with a valid MAC; b) Percentage of routes lost due to security (assuming routes between OBUs and RSUs with a maximum of 3 hops, according to SB2RP); c) Percentage of equivalent routes (same route to same destination, with or without security); d) Percentage of secure routes with more hops; e) Percentage of secure routes with the same number of hops but using a path with lower quality (based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)); f) Total number of refreshment messages cached in the active VUs; g) Percentage of beacons transmitted with the overhead of a refreshment message; h) Percentage of beacons transmitted with the overhead of a sync message. The x-axis of the graphics presented, contain the time of the day associated to the real data samples. We also analysed two geographical-dependent parameters: the percentage of updated OBUs per location and the percentage of beacons received with a valid MAC per location. We present the results over a simplified map of the Porto city in white and Atlantic Ocean, Douro River and Leixões harbour in blue. 5.3.1 Fixed periods of refreshment We tested different periods to distribute a single refreshment message with the unique aim of updating the routing key, ρ. With communications up to 1 km, we tested periods of 10 minutes, 1 h and 2 hours. All the tests were initially done allowing the OBUs to cache the refreshment messages to the last 8 time intervals. Based on the results with the period of 10 minutes, we inspected the impact of the variation on the historical cache, setting it to 32. The results of the several performance metrics for the 4 configurations are shown in Fig. 16 . Globally, we observe that the overhead of the messages associated to the secure routing is only present in a small percentage of the transmitted beacons (2.5% maximum in Fig. 16 g and 0.27% in Fig. 16 h). Moreover, there is a ratio of approximately 1 10 for those two types of transmitted messages, with the bigger ones (sync messages) being the less frequent. Since TROPHY messages are piggybacked on top of SB2RP, those results are according to one of the main goals of TROPHY: messages needed to keep the security process should only be present in a small number of SB2RP messages, and the majority of those messages should be the small refreshment messages rather than the big sync messages. Regarding the percentage of valid beacons, the period of 2 hours has the best results, with values close to 100%. Consequently, the routes created, based on the received beacons, have minor changes: the percentage of routes lost is residual, always lower than 0.25% (Fig. 16 b); most of the routes are the same, always greater than 97.5% (Fig. 16 c); the routes that are not equivalent are replaced by alternatives with more hops or lower quality. The percentage of valid beacons associated to the other periods of refreshments (10 minutes and 1 h) is highly affected by the limit imposed on the historical cache. For the period of 1 h caching, the last 8 messages correspond to 8 hours, while for the period of 10 minutes it corresponds to 1: 20 (8 time intervals) and 5: 20 (32 time intervals). After filling the cache, all these cases have associated a variation on the percentage of valid beacons, meaning that VUs do not keep the refreshment messages needed to update the neighbours. For the 2 hours period, after the filling of the historical (16 hours) there is no observable variation. The number of refreshment messages cached in the VANET (Fig. 16 f) is mostly independent of the period of refreshment, and tend to be dependent on the value used in the historical cache, 8 or 32. As expected, the strong dependency is associated to the number of active VUs (see Fig. 11), clearly visible on the minimum around 5: 00 when less OBUs are active. The higher percentage of lost routes in all the tests are coincident with the time window where it was expectable to have communication problems (see Section 5.1), so from 1: 00 to 6: 00 the VANET is clearly more susceptible to the chosen parameters. A period of 10 minutes combined with a limit of 8 time intervals for the historical cache yields the worst results. With a period of 10 minutes, the higher percentage of valid beacons obtained with a limit of 32 time intervals in the historical cache, is coincident with a higher percentage of overhead caused by refreshment messages and a lower percentage of overhead related with the transmission of sync messages. This is coincident with the activation of a high number of OBUs, at 5: 10 (see Fig. 11) with bidirectional connections with RSUs (see Fig. 14). Although OBUs have contact with RSUs, the epidemic propagation of cached messages reduces the number of sync messages (Fig. 16 g and h respectively). The best and the worst case, respectively 2 hours and 10 minutes periods with the historical cache of 8, are compared in terms of the impact in the different locations. Fig. 17 shows the percentage of updated OBUs per location refreshing the routing key in periods of 10 minutes, and Fig. 18 shows the same information when refreshing the routing key in periods of 2 hours. In the very centre of the city, where most of the RSUs are placed, the impact is imperceptible. In all the remaining area, a shorter refreshment period has a negative impact, meaning that the refreshment messages produced by KDC are not available among the VUs when needed. In the case of periods of two hours, not all the OBUs are immediately updated when moving in the periphery of the city, but still most of the beacons received can be validated (see Fig. 19 ). The absence of a negative impact caused by the outdated VUs moving in the periphery happens due to the partitions in the VANET. Although globally outdated, the VUs can validate beacons among each other and can be updated on a needed basis (when close to updated neighbours). 5.3.2 Adverse communication conditions We tested the behaviour of our solution under adverse communication conditions, limiting the propagation of the refreshment and the sync messages in space and time. The limitation in space is done limiting the communications up to 100 metres, instead of 1 km, with about 23% less received beacons. The limitation in time is done by explicitly discarding 90% of the received beacons in all the VUs. Both conditions are considered artificial and very unlikely to be found in real environments, at least continuously for a wide area during a long period, as we are testing. Nevertheless, the behaviour is indicative for less aggressive and unexpected conditions. With a fixed refreshment of 2 hours, the maximum percentage of invalid beacons was 1.5% and the maximum percentage of lost routes was 1.4%. The overhead of both types of messages was always smaller than 0.1%. Taking these results in consideration, the following scenarios presented will include the case where communications are limited to 100 metres and, at the same time, 90% of the received beacons are discarded in all the VUs. The impact of such conditions will be analysed and compared according to the context of the upcoming scenarios. 5.3.3 Successive exclusions of a single VU We tested the impact of successive exclusions of one VU. Based on the results of Section 5.3.1, we used the period of 2 hours to successively exclude 1 VU with 0% and 10% for the basal refreshment rate. Along with it, based on the results of Section 5.3.2, we tested the scenario with adverse communication conditions. The percentages of valid beacons received, lost routes due to security and overhead of the 2 types of TROPHY messages are shown in Fig. 20 , respectively a, b, g and h. It is evident the presence of periodic spikes, associated to the 2 hours period. The worst results are obtained under adverse communication conditions, although, even in this case, the impact of the exclusions tend to disappear after 1 h and are not present at the time of the next exclusion. Without the basal refreshment rate defined, brr, there is an evident inability to authenticate all the beacons. Moreover, the beacons with the overhead of the refreshment message is extremely high, near 40% in some cases, Fig. 20 g. The case with the basal refreshment rate set (without limitations on communication) has clearly a good performance, with almost no impact on the percentage of valid beacons and a maximum overhead in approximately 10% of sent beacons. 5.3.4 Single exclusion of multiple VUs We tested the impact of a single exclusion of 16 out of the 446 VUs simultaneously. We used the period of 2 hours to refresh the routing key without exclusions before and after the test. The exclusions occur at 10: 00. We tested the scenario with 0% and 5% for the basal refreshment rate. Just as in Section 5.3.3, we tested the scenario with adverse communication conditions. The percentages of valid beacons received and lost routes due to security are shown in Fig. 21 . There is a spike associated to the exclusion of the 16 elements, which was expected (based on the results of the previous scenarios). Associated to the time of the exclusion there is an increase of overhead on beacons (absent after 1 h) of approximately 16%, 8% and 23% (the order is according to the legends). 5.3.5 Reset of all the keys in the KDC We tested the behaviour of our solution recovering from the disclosure on all the KDC symmetric keys. We used the period of 2 hours to release refreshment messages and gave an order to reset all the keys in two different times: at the beginning of the emulation (18: 00) and after 16 hours (10: 00). We used two different reset instants aiming to differentiate the impact in the VANET. We used the period of 2 hours to refresh the routing key without exclusions before and after the reset. As in the previous scenarios, we tested the same configurations with adverse communication conditions. The results of the 4 tests are shown in Fig. 22 . The percentage of the valid beacons of the two cases, where the reset of the keys occurs at 18: 00, have visible oscillations in the first hours, reaching the 100% multiple times (Fig. 22 a). For the cases without adverse communication conditions, starting at 16: 00, the result of the reset at 18: 00 and 10: 00 tend to be similar. This indicates that for the cases where the reset of the keys occurs at 18: 00, the initial hours have little benefit for the global state of the VANET. The small impact of the initial hours are according to the fact that the direct contacts with RSUs tend to take more time from 18: 00 up to 5: 30 (Fig. 14) mostly due to the reduction of active OBUs in VANET (Fig. 11). Despite the variations in the percentage of valid beacons, the percentage of lost routes (Fig. 22 b) is tendentiously small, indicating that the OBUs do not stay long periods outdated when close to an RSU. 5.3.6 Validation with a different data set The previous scenarios with the correspondent variation of parameters gave important insights about the behaviour of our solution under the different conditions found along the 24 hours of the data set. It is evident that the different characteristics of the VANET found at different hours have a strong impact on the evaluated parameters. For the available data, we found the functional lower limits of the parameters, although, in different situations, those values are not guaranteed to have the same impact. Therefore, we do not have the goal to provide global best parameters (e.g. the best value for the basal refreshing rate), but rather prove the reliability of TROPHY under different scenarios associated to traces of vehicles of a normal day of VANET activity. Besides the results presented in the article, more were obtained during the evaluation made with the trace-based emulator. For sake of simplicity only a representative set of the obtained results are presented. The analysis of other situations is dependent on the collection of different data to build new data sets. The time for each trace-based emulation (6 minutes in the worst case in a high-end laptop computer 4 4 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz and an SDD. ) is relatively small so a wide number of tests are possible to perform in a short period. We had available a different set of 24 hours of traces collected from the same VANET on October 2014 (the same geographical area). However, the number of VUs available in that data set is smaller, only 350 (instead of 446), and the time granularity of the collection is 5 seconds (instead of 2). We did not consider that data set in the initial tests, since it has worst characteristics. Nevertheless, we used it to confront the results of some association of parameters with different conditions. The results of 4 associations are presented in Fig. 23 . When compared with the correspondent ones of the previous scenarios analysed in detail, it is visible the same patterns, with only a small percentage of lost routes when refreshing the keys in two hours periods. 5.4 Integration scenario With TROPHY, we aim to overcome a limitation found in IEEE 1609.2 and not to replace it nor to invalidate the use of any other WAVE protocol. From the point of view of a WAVE application, TROPHY is used similarly as the strategy proposed by IEEE 1609.2 to sign (and transform by the inclusion of a security envelope) messages into secure messages and vice versa. With an operation to transform messages into TROPHY messages and another one to validate TROPHY messages, an application can create secure TROPHY messages to send, and validate the received TROPHY messages, while using all the WAVE stack unaware of the transformation. The same strategy is used by IEEE 1609.2 to abstract cryptographic operations and allow the creation of messages (secure protocol data units, SPDUs) with multiple layers of cryptographic protection, and so, TROPHY messages can also be one of those layers. 6 Conclusion and future work We presented TROPHY, a set of protocols capable of maintaining the authenticity of routing messages in a VANET. The solutions presented were designed in order to deal with restricted and well-defined conditions found in a specific VANET. To validate the architecture and the protocols, we developed a trace-based emulator where we implemented the protocols and analysed their behaviour and impact taking advantage of real data collected from our target VANET. With this work, we can conclude that TROPHY is effectively able to protect SB2RP, the routing protocol in our target VANET, from external attackers. Regarding new ideas and improvements, at the end of this work, those are related with four main topics: Cooperation between different KDCs: The possibility of temporary cooperation, without compromising any of the companies in the future time, is a natural improvement. With this ability, OBUs of different companies could help each other upon some specific order from their respective KDC. In addition, static nodes, such as sensors, could have the benefit of receiving cryptographic material when some OBU is crossing the area. The use of alternative technologies: The current OBUs can connect to WiFi networks, such as 802.11g. The ability to use such extra technology can increase the number of places where OBUs can receive information. With this, the task of RSUs can be replaced by Access Points (APs) in remote areas. Alternatively, it is interesting the idea of using long-range, low throughput radio communication technologies, such as LoRA 5 5 , to perform massive long-distance key updates in a VANET, even if only to broadcast a subset of the total number of refreshment messages (see Fig. 15). A mechanism for periodical quality evaluation: The decisions in the VANET may be improved based on the analysis of the previous conditions. Along with the implementation on the field, a mechanism to collect and analyse the impact of different orders may be considered essential. A mechanism for intrusion detection: We built all the mechanisms to exclude compromised nodes after being pinpointed by any reason. According to the conditions faced by VUs, the detection of misbehaving VUs in the VANET may significantly improve the overall functionality of the network by allowing a fast exclusion of compromised VUs. TROPHY can take advantage of a complementary centralised entity that, based on the local perception of each VU, and consequent misbehaviour reports, builds a wide view of the VANET. In the context of VANETs, there are a wide range of proposals using plausibility checks to identify faulty nodes, such as the ones proposed by Bißmeyer et al. [62] and Kumar et. al[63].

All rights reserved.In this paper we present loop (loop over orderly phases), a trace-based emulator for Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This is an alternative and novel method to evaluate improvements on VANET protocols, which relies and takes advantage of real data samples collected from an existing network. Those samples are vehicles' geographical locations and radio reception events, which represent mobility and communication patterns of the VANET. From those samples, loop creates a synthetic environment to simulate and evaluate communication protocols on the target VANET. loop also includes an interactive mode to manage the emulation process and a visualization mode that shows different time and geographical-dependent aspects. The development of loop was motivated by the need of an non-intrusive methodology to intensively analyse and deterministically compare the impact of several strategies for communication protocols and all their possible variations in a realistic scenario, both in terms of mobility and radio communication opportunities. Namely, we created loop to evaluate the impact of adding security features to the routing control plane of an VANET. Since the VANET includes hundreds of vehicles, the computational performance is critical to speed-up evaluations. With loop we were able to perform complex, multi-variable performance evaluations of 24 hour periods in durations ranging from 6 up to 30 minutes.",

Most public transportation systems implement fare collection systems that can provide the accurate origins of travelers’ routes but not accurate destinations. In this paper we look at Wi-Fi, more specifically 802.11 data-link layer, as a candidate to provide OD matrix estimations. We present a system and an algorithm capable of collecting information, complemented with positioning and time, regarding Wi-Fi capable devices inside a bus. A system is also presented to implement this concept using minimal requirements. An implementation of this system was deployed in a public bus to collect data for several months. This resulted on over 71929 traveler routes collected in 127 different days. This data was contextualized and mapped to an OD system in order to demonstrate how it can be used to generate OD matrix estimations.",

        "doc_abstract": "Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Along with the growing number of applications and end-users, online network attacks and advanced generations of malware have continuously proliferated. Many studies have addressed the issue of intrusion detection by inspecting aggregated network traffic with no knowledge of the responsible applications/services. Such systems fail to detect intrusions in applications whenever their abnormal traffic fits into the network normality profiles. We address the problem of detecting intrusions in (known) applications when their traffic exhibits anomalies. Building traffic profiles for each separate application is the main challenge of this problem. This paper surveys traffic classification methodologies, within a taxonomy framework, to find out the best possible traffic classification methodologies that could help us answer the following question: given a traffic sample, generated by a particular application, does it conforms to the expected application's traffic? The key requirements for a practical solution are discussed. Then, the referred traffic classification methodologies are assessed in terms of their capabilities, limitations and challenges for being used as a part of this solution. The approaches based on “multiple sub-flows” have shown the potential to be used for building robust and practical per-application profiles in near real-time. An overview of a blend of real-time approaches is also described. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

For that purpose, VMHalt uses several strategies to classify an underlying layer as virtual. Our results shows that: although individual strategies have their own weaknesses, leading to a wrong decision, by excluding the ones that could classify a physical system incorrectly as a virtual one, a weighted decision from all strategies correctly detects an underlying virtualization engine with increased probability, while true hardware is always recognised as such.",

A conceptual analysis was performed on privacy policies to categorise their content. Results were compared with other international studies. It was found that only 26% of the municipalities provide privacy policy statements and many of those exhibit significant gaps considering the information that can be expected in such documents.

Unlike the first scenario, the second one is a new research path that has received less attention in the scope of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) research. The term \"unsupervised\" refers to the method ability to select the optimal number of components automatically without the need of careful initialization.

To carry out such distribution efficiently, we use wireless broadcast and Fountain Codes with low density random encoding to tolerate network packet losses. In particular, we use a hybrid coding technique that combines forward coding using weak LT Codes with a feedback phase at the end, which allows concluding the process faster with lower computing cost than traditional LT codes and without the precoding of Raptor Codes. The novelty of our approach consists of using a scheduler to orchestrate the clients' feedback. The scheduler is scalable in the number of clients and allows the server to know which clients are active and in which phase, and control the coding process adequately. We show early experimental results from simulation and from a practical testbed that confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach. With a feedback phase triggered when just 2% symbols are missing, we reduced the codewords overhead by 2.5% with respect to traditional LT Codes. We also achieved a high reduction in computational overhead associated to weak LT Codes. Moreover, this approach gives the server full control over the transfer, avoiding producing codewords beyond those strictly needed. Using 802.11g in ad-hoc mode and exploiting TXOPs, we transferred a 100MB file in 21.77s with up to 10% losses.",

With this type of rateless encoding we were able to avoid the feedback channel from the receivers and the need to retransmit the lost packets. This way it is possible to take advantage of the full bandwidth of the channel to transmit useful data. To encode each packet the system has to select n different symbols and since they are chosen randomly from K symbols sized image, the system has to pick a few (symbols) far apart from each other. This makes the CPU cache useless, decreasing the efficiency of the codeword generation process when the message size K is very large, especially on low power processors like ODROID-U3 and RaspberryPI. To overcome this problem we study a Block Angular encoding approach witch divides the message in nb blocks, small enough to be inside the CPU cache. In this paper we compare the encoding results using regular LT codes and the Block Angular codes, discussing its pros and cons in relation to the DETIboot system and other file distributing systems.",

The proposed Cognitive Routable Ad-hoc Network (CRAN) protocol allows efficient and distributed information sharing within the same hierarchy and between distinct hierarchical levels. The CRAN mechanisms contain the control plane, which includes the discovery mechanism and the autonomous adaptation when topology changes, and the data plane, which is responsible to forward tactical messages within the platoon. The evaluation results show that CRAN provides a fast knowledge forwarding with high message delivery and requires small bandwidth. This ensures real-time situation updates, improving operational reality awareness and more accurate decisions, improving the overall operation results.",

These tags use a pseudo-random identifier, which is the output of a hash function fed by a fixed secret key that uniquely identifies the tag and by two random challenges that change on each tag activation. The use of random challenges makes it extremely difficult for someone not knowing the secret key of a tag to track its multiple activations. For someone knowing all valid keys, finding out the key that generated a specific tag response requires a time-consuming exhaustive search, if the number of valid keys is large. This can be performed in a very efficient way on a general purpose graphics processing unit. Our simulations show that on a very demanding scenario a single Tesla S1070 system can identify in near real-time the tags generated by 100 single-lane highway RFID readers.",

By running locally on a citizen's computer, the PIdP paradigm is well suited to assist his/her eID-based authentication.

Several protocols and variants exist targeting the replacement of STP variants, most of them proprietary and with limited scope of operation. The recent protocols, IETF TRILL and IEEE SPB, target mainly data center networks, are based on complex concepts, require great processing power from switches and huge investment in new gear. In this paper we propose Self-Configurable Switches Protocol (SCS) as an alternative to all these protocols. It has the following advantages: it is configuration-free, thus less vulnerable to human mistakes; it enhances the network stability and performance when comparing with STP; and it is suitable to the range of equipment and networks that typically run STP variants, minimizing the need for potential large investments required by TRILL and SPB. This paper describes the main characteristics, processes and mechanisms of SCS, presents some lab and simulation experiments with STP and SCS, and provides demonstrations that SCS provides a more reliable service than STP variants, and a more cost effective alternative to TRILL and SPB network dependability. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

Nevertheless, wireless technologies face performance limitations due to unstable wireless conditions and mobility of devices. In face of multi-path propagation and low data-rate stations, cooperative relaying promises gains in performance and reliability. However, cooperation procedures are unstable and introduce overhead that can endanger performance. In this paper we analyze the performance of a hybrid relaying protocol build based on the combination of opportunistic and broadcast-based relaying approaches. Hybrid relaying aims to increase the transmission capacity of wireless networks (proactive operation) when compared to proactive opportunistic and broadcast-based approaches due to rectifying the setbacks involved in those approaches, while adding a reactive approach to recover from failed transmissions. © 2013 IEEE.",

Recently, it was presented an e-government interoperability model that preserves privacy during the dynamic orchestration of services. In this paper we present a prototype that implements that model using software agents. The model and the prototype are briefly described; an illustrative use case is presented; and the advantages of using software agents to implement the model are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",

The framework adds extra information to packets, which enables a firewall to authenticate its origin and to get an identity attribute for discriminating the entity responsible for the packet, upon which an access control policy can be implemented. This framework uses trusted third party services for authenticating people and providing related identity attributes for firewalls.

Nevertheless, wireless technologies face performance limitations due to unstable wireless conditions and mobility of devices. In face of multi-path propagation and low data rate stations, cooperative relaying promises gains in performance and reliability for low-cost single antenna devices. However, cooperation procedures may be very unstable when relay selection relies on current Channel State Information (CSI) and is agnostic of interference induced by concurrent transmissions and local CPU load. As a result, the performance of cooperative relaying in realistic scenarios may be very different from interference-free scenarios that have been the focus of most of the existing proposals so far. In a clear contrast to prior art we propose an opportunistic relay selection mechanism that is aware of interference and agnostic of channel status. © 2012 IEEE.",

We keep the existing IPv4 (or IPv6) host-based core routing functionalities, while we enable hosts to become routers between separate address spaces by exploring the new location header. For a proof of concept, we modified the TCP/IP stack of a Linux host to handle our new protocol layer and we designed and con- ceived a novel NAT box to enable current hosts to interact with the modified stack.",

This, however, is goal difficult to achieve due to the de-centralized nature of these systems. In the end it boils down to finding a subset of trusted nodes to be placed in critical positions of the communication path. But the question remains: \"How to know if a given node can be trusted?\". In this paper we present a survey of a new research area which goal is to exploit trust in social links to solve some of the shortcomings of anonymous communication systems.

The architecture was designed for domestic or enterprise facilities and uses the 802. IX authentication architecture as the base support infrastructure for dealing with unequivocal traffic binding to specific entities (persons or servers). Simultaneously, such binding uses virtual identities and encryption for preserving the privacy and protection of traffic originators from network eavesdroppers other than authorized traffic auditors. The traffic from each known originator is profiled with some detail, namely it includes a role tag and an application tag. Role tags are defined by originators and only partially follow a standard policy. On the contrary, application tags should follow a standard policy in order to reason about abnormal scenarios raised when correlating traffic from several instances of the same application. A first prototype was developed for Linux, using iptables and FreeRADIUS and conveying packet tagging information on a new IP option field. © 2011 IEEE.",

Brain responses were extracted in particular scenarios, namely with visual stimulation leading to biological brain responses known as visual evoked potentials. In our study, we evaluated a novel method, using only 8 occipital electrodes and the energy of differential EEG signals, to extract information about the subjects for further use as their biometric features. To classify the features obtained from each individual we used a one-class classifier per subject. These classifiers are trained only with target class features, which is the correct procedure to apply in biometric authentication scenarios. Two types of one-class classifiers were tested, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Data Description. Two other classifier architectures were also studied, both resulting from the combination of the two previously mentioned classifiers. After testing these classifiers with the features extracted from 70 subjects, the results showed that brain responses to visual stimuli are suitable for an accurate biometric authentication. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "doc_abstract": "Fast handovers of roaming stations (STAs) between access points (APs) require preauthentication or fast reauthentication within new serving APs. The current standards address only over-the-DS (Distribution System) preauthentications for 802.1X authentications. However, over-the-DS preauthentication is not suitable for fast moving STAs, which may loose their connection with the currently serving AP before performing preauthentications in the neighbouring APs. This paper presents several ways to achieve fast 802.11 handovers while keeping the basic security features of 802.1X authentications. To do so, we designed a fast 802.1X reauthentication protocol. This protocol enables an STA to perform many fast 802.1X reauthentications after an initial, possible slow, 802.1X authentication. The reauthentication protocol requires little from the network environment, namely a new, central Reauthentication Service (RS) (possibly integrated with the local 802.1X Authentication Server). To speed up 802.1X reauthentications within handovers, the reauthentication protocol was piggybacked into 802.11 management frames that are ordinarily used during handovers. This way, we are able to perform 802.1X reauthentications while taking the normal, over-the-air 802.11 steps for performing handovers (network probing, authentication, and (re)association). Besides this over-the-air approach, we also show how the 802.1X reauthentication protocol can be implemented using an over-the-DS approach. A prototype implementation using over-the-air 802.1X reauthentication showed that handover delays can be dramatically reduced to 1.5 ms, while an 802.1X fast resume takes more than 150 ms. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The use of a secure component, the SIM-Card, provides a set of capabilities not seen in other access architectures and an advantage for MNOs. Nevertheless upcoming requirements in terms of open interfaces, new services and customer demands are questioning the actual architecture. This paper presents a novel approach to authentication and profile management that can be reused by both MNOs and 3rd party providers to answer the upcoming requirements. Here, a user is able to store his own identity information in different places, while taking advantage of the strong authentication mechanisms provided by the MNO. Furthermore, by integrating MNOs' generic authentication architecture with user-centric identity management, we are creating a generic way for service providers to reuse this authentication infrastructure, providing both single sign-on and strong authentication.

However, it raises several security issues, since the owners of such hotspots cannot be trusted to be honest; therefore, visitors should consider them as potential Man-in-the-Middle attackers. On the other hand, the owners of such hotspots should not be legally accounted for illegal or unethical activities performed by visitors. We defend that both issues can be tackled by using a VPN-based access architecture for visitors. However, current VPN solutions do not handle gracefully the mobility of clients, an interesting possibility to navigate in a sea of user-provided hotspots. In this paper, we propose a modification of OpenVPN, a very effective and secure, open-source VPN solution, to support the seamless mobility of VPN clients. The proposed modification allows OpenVPN tunnels to be reconfigured as soon as possible after a client handover, in order to minimize outage delays and traffic losses. Performance evaluation with an implemented prototype in different test scenarios showed that we can reduce the handover delay imposed at the VPN level down to 1.7% of the current value, at least. © 2010 IEEE.",

The protocol keeps the security functionalities of 802.1X but uses a new reauthentication protocol that promotes fast handovers during reassociations. The reauthentication protocol recovers the original 802.11 paradigm: authenticate first, reassociate next. Following this paradigm, we conceived two new 802.11 authentication and reassociation protocols, which allow a mobile station to perform 802.1X reauthentications before reassociations with the same functionality of a complete 802.1X authentication. Furthermore, reassociation protocols are authenticated, preventing denial-or-service scenarios that are not handled by 802.11i. Our new approach requires little from the environment, namely a new, central Reauthentication Service, for storing data used in the reauthentication of stations. The time of security-related tasks that contribute to handover delays was dramatically reduced to 1.5 ms, while an 802.1X fast resume takes more than 150 ms. Finally, our protocol addresses most design goals and problems stated by standards' working groups for fast, secure roaming in 802.11. © 2008 ACM.",

The displayed image does not convey any personal information, namely the voter's choices, to the hosting computer; voter's choices are solely presented at the terminal. Furthermore, the image contains visual authentication elements that can be validated by the voter using information presented at the terminal. This way, hosting computers are not able to gather voters' choices or to deceive voters, by presenting tampered ballots, without being noticed.",

But since malicious electoral servers have no means to choose which votes should not be considered in the tally, the weak proof is strong enough for ensuring voters that the outcome of the election was not manipulated by the servers towards a particular outcome. In spite have been conceived for the REVS system, our anonymizing architecture can be used in other voting systems as well. The only requirement is that it should be possible to submit the same vote several times and to detect and drop vote replicas at the tallying phase, which is valid for other blind signature voting protocols.

We consider a security architecture that does exactly the opposite: information sequences are first converted to longer channel codewords which are then encrypted using a classical stream cipher. Although this approach requires longer encryption sequences, our analysis shows that the natural randomness of the noisy communication channel can be used effectively against known-plaintext attacks. We also address practical implementation issues in physical-layer encryption and discuss their impact on the system architecture and on the security performance. © 2008 IEEE.",

The modification promotes bidirectional data transfers between stations that reserve the medium using an RTS/CTS handshake. This approach reduces the amount of RTS/CTS handshakes required when two stations have simultaneously data to send to each other. Consequently, we improve the occupation of the medium with useful data transfers and minimize RTS collisions by reducing the number of RTS/CTS handshakes required to exchange data. Theoretical performance evaluations with several operational parameters and data volumes showed a reduction of 7 to 47% of the elapsed time to complete a bidirectional data exchange. Fairness in the medium access is kept but stations should use extra policies for preventing frames in output queues to take too long to be transmitted; a simple policy based on per-frame counters is sketched.",

The new TCP handshake conforms with the standard and is fully compatible with existing TCP implementations.

The architecture had to accommodate specific RTS requirements, namely the security of Professionals' credentials, the mobility of Professionals, and the scalability to accommodate new health institutions. The adopted solution uses short lived certificates and cross-certification agreements between RTS and eHealth institutions for authenticating Professionals accessing the RTS. These certificates carry as well the Professional's role at their home institution for role-based authorization. Trust agreements between health institutions and RTS are necessary in order to make the certificates recognized by the RTS. The implementation was based in Windows technology and as a general policy we avoided the development of specific code; instead, we used and configured available technology and services. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",

Design/methodology/approach - Robust Electronic Voting System (REVS) was chosen, a voting system designed to support internet voting processes, as the start point for studying the introduction of vote weights. Findings - The work resulted in an internet voting system supporting vote weights, based on REVS. Research limitations/implications - In the solution presented, there is still a problem regarding anonymity, for the case of a single voter with a particular weighted vote. This is a fundamental problem, since it also exists in paper-based elections. Practical implications - This version of REVS has the same properties as the original REVS, apart from the anonymity issue above. Apart from this the process of registering voters got more complicated, since now it includes an extra action for binding a weight. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this modified version of REVS is the first electronic voting system supporting vote weights. Another novelty of this work is the modulus sharing optimization used for the RSA key pairs of each entity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

Finally, the KDC is used to authenticate ARP transactions and to distribute session keys to pairs of LAN hosts, allowing them to set up other peer-to-peer secure interactions using such session keys. The new, authenticated DHCP and ARP protocols are fully backward compatible with the original protocols; all security-related data is appended to standard protocol messages. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",

        "doc_abstract": "This document presents an efficient, high quality random number generator for multi-programmed environments, in particular for UNIX/Linux and Windows systems. The algorithm uses a system's notion of the time, given by a high-precision real-time counter, to obtain random bits, and a combination of system calls to reduce the correlation between consecutive random bits. The combination of system calls introduces variable and unpredictable real-time gaps in the execution of the generator. We present a rationale for such variation and unpredictability, and we show that in fact they exist even when the generator runs in an adverse scenario, i.e., a lightly loaded system. We also show how the generator resists several attacks attempting to guess or control the values it produces. The quality of the generator is evaluated both in terms of its performance and the randomness of the byte sequences it produces. Comparing against other similar generators, CryptoLib and librand, our generator produces equally good random byte sequences, but its performance increases with the speed of the processor, while the performance of CryptoLib and librand is rather constant for each operating system, independently of the processor were it runs. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this paper we identify a restricted type of obligation which is useful to express new security policies. This type of obligation includes the following general situations: i) when two or more actions oblige each other, i.e. if one action is executed the others must also be executed and reciprocally, and ii) when an action obliges another and the obligatory action is causally dependent on the first action.",

This encryption mode is similar to another one, IOBC, and was likewise designed to propagate erroneous decryptions of tampered blocks of ciphered data to all following blocks, hence allowing to validate the integrity of that data using a predefined trailing value. However, EPBC is more secure than IOBC, as it is not vulnerable to any known-plaintext attacks, and is more efficient than IOBC. Performance tests ran on a SPARCstation 10/40 show that EPBC is in average 1.2 times faster than IOBC, and 6.3 to 10.9 times faster than a common combination of an encryption mode and a one-way hash function (CBC and MD5).",

Objects are stored persistently when reachable from an Eternal Root, regardless of their type. For programmers, objects are created and manipulated uniformly, independently of the time they persist.

A single programming paradigm is used to manipulate volatile, persistent and distributed objects uniformly. Object invocation is the basic primitive of the system, embodying all the features required for transparent handling of persistence and distribution. Object references can be freely passed as parameters in remote invocations or stored persistently. Objects are initially created as volatile and are automatically recycled when they are no longer referenced. Objects are promoted to persistent when they become reachable from a persistent root. Persistent objects are read from disk on demand when they are invoked and are written back to disk when the application terminates. Applications are written in a language similar to C++, but with some semantic differences. Classes are represented as special persistent objects. They are dynamically linked when needed and can be updated at runtime to install a newer version of the code. This paper contains a technical description of IK and an evaluation based on two years of experience in using the system to build applications.",
