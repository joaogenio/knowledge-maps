    "bio": "Best of the cohort in the 1989 Electrical and Computer Engineering course at the U. of Porto, exercised his area of specialisation (Control Systems) in the industry for 7 years, mainly in OEM electronic product development and top building automation projects e.g. for AIP's Europarque congress centre (https://www.europarque.pt/) and BCP's main data centre. Became technical director (with voting seat at the national standards committees) of an electrical equipment manufacturer, which he led to ISO 9002 quality assurance certification and international product certification. Passionate for Music (learned to play the guitar and took part in amateur bands in his youth; keen on choir singing, was a member of Porto Opera Circle), applied for a scholarship from FCT to take the (then pioneering) Music Technology course at the U. of York, co-organised by the Depts. of Music and Electronics. Tony Myatt and Dave Malham supervised his MSc thesis 'Motion-Controlled Music' (1997). With continued support from the FCT, went on to take his PhD on 3D physical models for room acoustic simulation under David Howard (Dept. of Electronics, with Jamie Angus and then Andy Tyrrell as second supervisors) being awarded the Kathleen Mary Stott prize for 'Excellence in research'. Following return to Portugal, took a lecturer post at the University of Aveiro and joined the Signal Processing group at its research institute IEETA. His research interests lie mainly on audio-related areas (acoustic modelling, architectural acoustics, signal processing, spatial hearing, auralisation, virtual reality). He is an active member of AES and has received official recognition (by Ordem dos Engenheiros) as 'Expert in Acoustic Engineering'. Particularly interested in multidisciplinary projects, has led the FCT-funded 'AcousticAVE - Auralisation Models and Applications in Virtual Reality Environments', a collaboration involving CIPsi (School of Psychology of the U. of Minho) to explore audio-visual cues to Biomotion perception. The success of AcousticAVE led to another collaborative project between the two teams, also supported by FCT: 'Paterson - Prototyping medical acoustic environments for the design of new auditory warning signals', in which room modelling and auralisation were again central aspects. Initially involved as co-PI, took the PI role once again following impediment of UM colleague Jorge Santos.  Audio-related health applications constitute another multidisciplinary research thread attracting his interest. He has collaborated in two projects, launched by UA's School of Health, for the development of hardware and software for the detection and analysis of respiratory sounds: FCT-funded 'Adventitious lung sounds as indicators of severity and recovery of lung pathology and sputum location' and QREN-funded 'Souns4Health'. In line with research projects, his academic supervision work also tends to be on audio topics, which are particularly suited to multidisciplinary projects and inter-departmental collaboration. He has taken the co-supervision of three PhD students from UA's Dept. of Communication and Art (DeCA) whose research involves electronics/computer technology. In 2018, Guilherme chaired the organising committee of the 21st Int. Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx), brought to Portugal for the first time. The event - arguably the most important of its kind ever organised in the country - took place at the University of Aveiro (DeCA) and attracted the support of 11 industry sponsors, including top international companies.

            "desc": "AcousticAVE aimed at integrating visual and aural immersion in VR environments, which poses numerous technological challenges, both in the development of adapted acoustic modelling techniques and the implementation of accurate aural-visual synchronisation. It involved collaboration between research units from the Universities of Minho (CIPsi) and Aveiro (IEETA), assisted by external consultants: Prof. Damian Murphy (University of York) and Juan Miguel Navarro (UCAM - Murcia). At the Laboratory of Visualization and Perception (LVP) in Guimarães, the U. of Minho had installed one of the most sophisticated VR systems in the country, equipped with a 2.2x9.6m continuous projection screen made up of 3 flexible configuration panels (0, 90 or 135º) and corresponding DLP (Digital Light Processing) projectors. A treadmill synchronised with the 3D visual scene allows walking on the virtual environment. User-tracking is available using both inertial and infra-red technology. The system’s main intended use was psychophysical research, focusing on naturalistic environments, which added to the importance of incorporating virtual sound. LVP researchers were constructing experiments on Biomotion perception (walking patterns) focussing on the cross-influence of the auditory and visual channels. For those experiments, it was crucial to obtain highly synchronised, real-time audiovisual stimuli. This linked perfectly with a line of research pursued at IEETA aimed at the development of auralisation in virtual and augmented reality environments. The initial work, based on a head-mounted display (HMD) system, had produced very encouraging results, the top example being the MSc project ‘Virtual Hall’ [Casaleiro08], awarded the first prize at the 2007 Audio Technology contest of the Portuguese section of the Audio Engineering Society (AES). In this scenario, the project involved two main work packages: 1) At IEETA, the development of a complete earphone-based auralisation package, to allow sound spatialisation taking into account the actual room acoustic properties (extracted automatically from the model) and the trajectory of the sound source, as well as the head orientation and position of the listener, both tracked in real time. Preliminary validation tests were carried out using a simple HMD system, but the main test-bed was LVP’s CAVE-like system, where it was installed and gradually updated with new features. 2) At LVP, hardware and software integration ensuring audiovisual synchronisation by controlling the latencies of the audio and video digital chains. Updates were perceptually validated. Psychophysical testing focussed on how people learn in, and interact with, auditory and audiovisual VR systems, allowing the development of new specific knowledge regarding how humans should be prepared to interact with these systems. The outcomes during the project included 3 international journal papers, 12 international conference papers, 1 PhD thesis, 2 computer applications and 2 workshops. A summary paper was subsequently published in the 8th Iberian Congress of Acoustics (TECNIACUSTICA 2014 - Murcia, Oct 29- Nov 3): Campos G, Dias P, Vieira J, Santos J, Mendonça C, Lamas JP, Silva N and Lopes S (2014) ‘AcousticAVE: Auralisation Models and Applications in Virtual Reality Environments’. FCT’s final evaluation report stated: ‘The scientific goals were fully attained. The results show great scientific quality, particularly in terms of refereed international journal publications. The project contributed to the training of young researchers and the international visibility of its team. This was a successful project, with good scientific productivity, which matched or exceeded the predictions in the proposal. In particular, rather than the predicted 4 papers in international conferences, 12 were published. Also deserving mention is the fact that the number of MSc theses completed in the context of the project (12) far exceeded what had been promised (4).'",

            "desc": "Operating Rooms (OR) and Recovery Rooms (RR) in hospitals are equipped with multiple medical devices capable of emitting audio alarm signals. These are normally designed by different manufacturers. International standards define general parameters for these warning signals, but disregard the space they will be used in and the tasks their users will be engaged with, resulting in a cacophony that healthcare staff often refer to as \"airport levels of noise\". This project aims at a user-centred approach to the design of audio warning interfaces, rooted in psychophysics and neurophysiology, making warning signals more informative and detectable. The team believe this will reduce the probability of human errors that often result in serious harm to patients. The method involves detailed acoustic characterisation of both types of room and observation of medical staff and their interaction with medical devices when a warning signal is triggered. The acoustic survey will assess the frequency ranges involved and include binaural measurements to record spatial patterns. This information will be used in the first stage of psychophysical and neurophysiologic tests to find the correspondence between sound-field parameters and the neural and behavioural responses at different levels of cognitive load. Room acoustic simulation models will be developed to allow non-invasive auralisation-based testing of new signals. In particular, the tests will explore the use of spatial cues to help detect the origin of the alarm signals and so accelerate the process of identifying the patient requiring attention, which is critical in a RR where some eight patients are being monitored. New audio warning signals will be designed taking into account the requirements identified and exploring spatialised (loudspeaker-based) delivery. The signals will be validated through 1) psychophysical and neurophysiologic testing in lab setting; 2) real-time auralisation with motion capture in 3D immersive audio-visual CAVE-like environment; 3) biomedical simulator. The envisaged results of the project are a library of audio warning signals and an acoustic prototyping tool, intended for use by both manufacturers and sound designers, considering all requirements and adapted to different levels of workload, background noise and events.  It will be possible to assign different sounds to different events and understand, through simulation, their effect in the sonic landscape of ORs and RRs. It is hoped this research will contribute to better audio design guidelines in medical contexts and ultimately better decision-making by staff working under high levels of stress and cognitive load.

            "desc": "The goal of this project was to contribute to the long-term goal of developing a new, objective and reliable outcome measure based on lung sounds to assess patients’ response to respiratory interventions. This was (and is) needed as there is a significant lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of current respiratory treatments. Changes in adventitious lung sounds (ALS) have the potential to contribute to improve the respiratory assessment and monitoring of patients, even in populations that are unable to collaborate with the measurements. But, in order to reach this goal, validation studies are critical to ensure that the lung sounds are responsive to changes of the magnitude of those produced during respiratory treatments.\r\nRespiratory therapies, physical (such as airway clearance therapy) or chemical (such as medication or inhalation therapies) are of increasing importance since chronic respiratory diseases have been found to be the fourth most frequent cause of mortality worldwide and the diseases ranking higher in this list are also known to have respiratory impairment associated. However, little was known about the effectiveness of respiratory therapies due to insufficient accuracy, reliability and sensitivity of the outcome measures commonly used. Imaging techniques are the gold standard to assess lung conditions, but due to practical, radiation, and financial issues, cannot be applied before/after each treatment. Research on the acoustics of lung sounds had shown that different airways and different pathologies produce different ALS and computer aided lung sound analysis (CALSA) characterising ALS had the potential to provide objective and reliable measures in a clinical setting. However, studies assessing the responsiveness to change to treatment of ALS had never been performed.\r\nThis project aimed to assess if ALS are responsive to change (treatment) and can be used as an outcome measure, enabling professionals to monitor patients and assess the effectiveness of respiratory treatments. To validate the responses to treatment assessed in this way, chest imaging was included. A pilot study was conducted to maximise safety and effectiveness of the study and train the research team. The main study was then implemented, followed by analysis and professional dissemination. It involved 100 patients with Lower Respiratory Tract Infection treated at Aveiro Infante D. Pedro Hospital. Patients’ relevant demographic, anthropometric and clinical data, (lung sounds, lung function, breathlessness, oxygen saturation and chest CT scan) were collected within 24h of their first appointment. Following treatment with daily medication and respiratory physiotherapy 3 times a week during 2 weeks, the same measurements were repeated.\r\nAn important part of the project was the investigation on automatic, computer-aided ALS detection, which led to several conference publications:\r\n- Dinis J, Campos G, Rodrigues J, Marques A (2012) ‘Respiratory Sound Annotation Software’.

The Portuguese team was led by Guilherme Campos at the University of Aveiro and the British team was led by Damian Murphy at the University of York.\r\nThe development of virtual and augmented reality environments has allowed, among many other applications, remarkable progress in the investigation, interpretation and promotion of cultural heritage. In Archaeology, virtual reconstructions can be used to test hypotheses on the design and usage of monuments or sites. The same kind of virtual reconstructions can help in their interpretation: the visitor can be offered ‘time travels’ through their historical evolution and virtual tours of areas now ruined or off limits for conservation reasons. Virtual tours can also be used for heritage promotion (through the Internet, for example). Most of the effort in the design and development of Virtual Reality (VR) systems has been directed at providing visual immersion. The development of increasingly convincing models demands considerations of other senses, especially hearing – we are still very much in the ‘silent era’ of VR. Archaeology also tends to favour predominantly visual interpretations of the past; the systematic exploration of its often forgotten sonic dimension – Acoustic Archaeology – started to emerge only very recently. Considering this context, the aim of this project was to investigate and develop the integration of audio in virtual reality environments, with a particular focus on Heritage applications, which require accurate room acoustic models. The development of physical modelling techniques is essential in this effort, and a key aspect for their practical applicability is parallel computing.
