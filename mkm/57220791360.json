        "doc_abstract": "© 2021 Association for Computational LinguisticsCommonsense is a quintessential human capacity that has been a core challenge to Artificial Intelligence since its inception. Impressive results in Natural Language Processing tasks, including in commonsense reasoning, have consistently been achieved with Transformer neural language models, even matching or surpassing human performance in some benchmarks. Recently, some of these advances have been called into question: so called data artifacts in the training data have been made evident as spurious correlations and shallow shortcuts that in some cases are leveraging these outstanding results. In this paper we seek to further pursue this analysis into the realm of commonsense related language processing tasks. We undertake a study on different prominent benchmarks that involve commonsense reasoning, along a number of key stress experiments, thus seeking to gain insight on whether the models are learning transferable generalizations intrinsic to the problem at stake or just taking advantage of incidental shortcuts in the data items. The results obtained indicate that most datasets experimented with are problematic, with models resorting to non-robust features and appearing not to be learning and generalizing towards the overall tasks intended to be conveyed or exemplified by the datasets.",

CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org)The representation of knowledge is a central task in Artificial Intelligence and has been an active topic of research since the beginnings of the field. Intensive research and labor has been put into producing resources which encode knowledge regarding different topics, structured in suitable formats so as to allow robust, automated reasoning over them. In Natural Language Processing, deep learning models are commonly given unstructured data and seek to learn the necessary knowledge and abstractions required to represent and understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the target language processing tasks. A popular method to address this issue is to expand the training process to include more tasks and data. Yet, it remains one of the challenges of deep learning. In this respect, a promising research path is to combine the rich knowledge encoded in structured resources with deep learning methods, enhancing them with the necessary means to more effectively learn the complexities of the target tasks. In this paper we set out to compare a Neuro-Symbolic model with mainstream Neuro-only models when they are tasked with solving commonsense reasoning problems, which heavily rely on appropriately represented knowledge: commonsense reasoning is an essential part of the human experience, encompassing human values and needs, and by resorting to it, we can organize sensible arguments and decide on effective actions. The results obtained indicate that there is no clear advantage to either approach, with the Neuro-Symbolic model being competitive amongst the Neuro-only models, but not superior.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on knee strength, and muscle latency after sudden inversion of amateur futsal players. Methods: Seventy-one male futsal players were recruited and randomized to a FIFA 11+ (n = 37, age: 27.0 ± 5.1 years) and a control group (n = 34, age: 26.0 ± 5.1 years). The FIFA 11+ programme was executed twice a week, for 10 weeks, followed-up after 10 weeks where both groups executed regular warm-ups. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee muscle strength was tested and latency time of the evertor muscles after sudden inversion of the ankle was executed with a trapdoor mechanism following an EMG protocol of selected leg muscles (peroneus brevis and peroneus longus). Results: No significant difference were observed between groups for short-term changes in isokinetic strength after adjustment for baseline differences. At long-term, significant gains were obtained after adjustment for baseline differences in eccentric strength for both lower limbs as for the H/Q ratios for the dominant limb. No changes between groups were observed in the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus latency time. Conclusions: Performing FIFA 11+ did not have short-term effects on knee strength and muscle latency after sudden inversion in amateur futsal players. However, significant long-term benefits were observed for eccentric strength and H/Q ratios. .",

This paper reports on the scientific reproduction of several systems addressing the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task of SemEval2018. Given a recent publication that pointed out spurious statistical cues in the data set used in the shared task, and that produced a revised version of it, we also evaluated the reproduced systems with this new data set. The exercise reported here shows that, in general, the reproduction of these systems is successful with scores in line with those reported in SemEval2018. However, the performance scores are worst than those, and even below the random baseline, when the reproduced systems are run over the revised data set expunged from data artifacts. This demonstrates that this task is actually a much harder challenge than what could have been perceived from the inflated, close to human-level performance scores obtained with the data set used in SemEval2018. This calls for a revival of this task as there is much room for improvement until systems may come close to the upper bound provided by human performance.",

It features NB-IoT - LTE Cat NB1 (Narrow Band IoT) to ensure robust connection to the Internet even in harsh conditions, and allows rapid development of complete IoT solutions for end-users. The development of a Linux image that exposes all the potential of the hardware platform is a must and will provide extra value to it. To create such an operating system, we examined the Yocto Project, which is a Linux building environment that is gaining a growing community of users, particularly enterprises. Nevertheless, Yocto is not the only choice for the embedded platform developer community. In fact, Armbian, a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution, appears as an popular alternative for embedded development in ARM boards. In this paper we show the steps we took from testing the first boot on the WiiPiiDo board until the development of the supporting operating system, finalizing with performance tests.

In this paper, we propose the exploitation of this conversion methodology as the basis for the comparative assessment of WordNets: given two WordNets, their relative quality in terms of capturing the lexical semantics of a given language, can be assessed by (i) converting each WordNet into the corresponding semantic space (i.e. into WordNet embeddings), (ii) evaluating the resulting WordNet embeddings under the typical semantic similarity prediction task used to evaluate word embeddings in general; and (iii) comparing the performance in that task of the two word embeddings, extracted from the two WordNets. A better performance in that evaluation task results from the word embeddings that are better at capturing the semantic similarity of words, which, in turn, result from the WordNet that is of higher quality at capturing the semantics of words.",

Previous works studied the distances between adjacent reversed complement words (symmetric word pairs) and also for non-adjacent words. It was observed that for some words a few distances were favoured (peaks) and that in some distributions there was strong peak regularity. The present work extends previous studies, by improving the detection and characterization of peak regularities in the symmetric word pairs distance distributions of the human genome. This work also analyzes the location of the sequences that originate the observed strong peak periodicity in the distance distribution. The results obtained in this work may indicate genomic sites with potential for the formation of hairpin/cruciform structures.",

Hence, we examined the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on performance in male amateur futsal players. METHODS: Seventy-one male futsal players from six amateur clubs were recruited and randomized to an intervention (N.=37, age: 27.0±5.1 years) or a control group (N.=34, age: 26.0±5.1 years). The intervention group was submitted to 10 weeks of FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, 2 sessions/week, followed by a 10-week follow-up period, while the control group performed regular futsal warm-ups during the training sessions. During the follow-up period both groups performed only regular warm-ups during their training sessions. Physical performance was assessed by measuring agility (T-test), sprint (30 m sprint), flexibility (sit-and-reach test) and vertical jump performance (squat jump). RESULTS: Differences between groups were found at baseline for training exposure, body mass index, body weight, flexibility, and sprint. The results of the effect of the FIFA 11+ on the sit-and-reach test, speed and agility did not show differences pre-post intervention, as well as for the 10-week follow-up. Jump performance, showed a significant difference in favor of the control group for the intervention period and the followup (crude β: -0.04 [95% CI: -0.06; -0.01]; -0.03 [95% CI: -0.06; -0.00], respectively), however after adjustment for the baseline differences the confidence interval fell out of the range of significance for the intervention and follow-up period (adjusted β, -0.05 [95% CI: -0.10; 0.00]; -0.05 [95% CI: -0.10; 0.04]). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown no short and long-term performance enhancement in sprint, flexibility, agility and jump performance after the FIFA 11+ in male amateur futsal players.",

All rights reserved.Duplicate Question Detection (DQD) is a Natural Language Processing task under active research, with applications to fields like Community Question Answering and Information Retrieval. While DQD falls under the umbrella of Semantic Text Similarity (STS), these are often not seen as similar tasks of semantic equivalence detection, with STS being implicitly understood as concerning only declarative sentences. Nevertheless, approaches to STS have been applied to DQD and paraphrase detection, that is to interrogatives and declaratives, alike. We present a study that seeks to assess, under conditions of comparability, the possible different performance of state-of-the-art approaches to STS over different types of textual segments, including most notably declaratives and interrogatives. This paper contributes to a better understanding of current mainstream methods for semantic equivalence detection, and to a better appreciation of the different results reported in the literature when these are obtained from different data sets with different types of textual segments. Importantly, it contributes also with results concerning how data sets containing textual segments of a certain type can be used to leverage the performance of resolvers for segments of other types.",

In this paper, we describe the development of an advanced distributional model for Portuguese, with the largest vocabulary and the best evaluation scores published so far. This model was made possible by resorting to new languages resources we recently developed: to a much larger training corpus than before and to a more sophisticated evaluation supported by new and more fine-grained evaluation tasks and data sets.

AECOPD are characterised by increased airway obstruction, mucus and air trapping, which results in changes in lung acoustics. Thus, adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS) may be useful to detect/monitor AECOPD. Objective: To evaluate computerised ARS changes during AECOPD. Methods: 25 non-hospitalised patients with AECOPD (16♂ 70 [62.5–77.0]yrs, FEV1 59 [31.5–73.0]%predicted) and 34 healthy volunteers (17♂ 63.5 [57.7–72.3]yrs, FEV1 103.0 [88.8–125.3]%predicted) were enrolled. ARS at anterior and posterior right and left chest were recorded at hospital presentation (T1), 15 days (T2) and 45 days (T3) after hospital presentation from patients with AECOPD and only once from healthy participants. A subsample of 9 patients (7♂; 66 [60.0–76.0]yrs; FEV1 62 [26.5–74.0]%predicted) was also included to study ARS pre-AECOPD (T0). Number of crackles and wheeze occupation rate (%Wh) were processed using validated algorithms. Results: During AECOPD, patients presented more inspiratory crackles at T1 than T3 (p = 0.013) and more inspiratory %Wh at T1 than T2 (p = 0.006), at posterior chest. Patients with stable COPD presented more inspiratory crackles (p = 0.012), at posterior chest, and more expiratory %Wh, both at anterior (p < 0.001) and posterior (p = 0.001) chest, than healthy participants. No differences were observed for the remaining ARS parameters or subsamples (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Inspiratory crackles seem to persist until 15 days post exacerbation whilst inspiratory %Wh decreased after this period. ARS seem to be sensitive to monitor AECOPD. This information may allow advances in monitoring the recovery time of patients with AECOPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings.",

Lab 3R – Respiratory Research and Rehabilitation Laboratory School of Health Sciences University of Aveiro (ESSUA) Agras do Crasto - Campus Universitário de Santiago Edifício 30 Aveiro 3810-193 Portugal Background Timely diagnosis of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is challenging as it depends on patients' reports. AECOPD are characterised by increased airway obstruction, mucus and air trapping, which results in changes in lung acoustics. Thus, adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS) may be useful to detect/monitor AECOPD. Objective To evaluate computerised ARS changes during AECOPD. Methods 25 non-hospitalised patients with AECOPD (16♂, 70 [62.5–77.0]yrs, FEV1 59 [31.5–73.0]%predicted) and 34 healthy volunteers (17♂, 63.5 [57.7–72.3]yrs, FEV1 103.0 [88.8–125.3]%predicted) were enrolled. ARS at anterior and posterior right and left chest were recorded at hospital presentation (T1), 15 days (T2) and 45 days (T3) after hospital presentation from patients with AECOPD and only once from healthy participants. A subsample of 9 patients (7♂; 66 [60.0–76.0]yrs; FEV1 62 [26.5–74.0]%predicted) was also included to study ARS pre-AECOPD (T0). Number of crackles and wheeze occupation rate (%Wh) were processed using validated algorithms. Results During AECOPD, patients presented more inspiratory crackles at T1 than T3 (p = 0.013) and more inspiratory %Wh at T1 than T2 (p = 0.006), at posterior chest. Patients with stable COPD presented more inspiratory crackles (p = 0.012), at posterior chest, and more expiratory %Wh, both at anterior (p < 0.001) and posterior (p = 0.001) chest, than healthy participants. No differences were observed for the remaining ARS parameters or subsamples (p > 0.05). Conclusions Inspiratory crackles seem to persist until 15 days post exacerbation whilst inspiratory %Wh decreased after this period. ARS seem to be sensitive to monitor AECOPD. This information may allow advances in monitoring the recovery time of patients with AECOPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings. Keywords Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Acute exacerbations Crackles Wheezes Computerised respiratory sounds 1 Introduction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disease frequently punctuated by acute exacerbations (AECOPD) [1], i.e., “acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that result in additional therapy” [2]. These events account for half of the total respiratory admissions for COPD [3] and are closely related with increases in healthcare costs (AECOPD related costs vary approximately from $88 to $7.757 per exacerbation worldwide) [4]. Furthermore, AECOPD are responsible for accelerating lung function decline, decrease quality of life and increase mortality [5]. The early identification and timely management of AECOPD has been shown to reduce hospital admissions and recovery time, while improving quality of life [6]. Nevertheless, most exacerbations are still not timely treated as the diagnosis/monitoring relies exclusively on patients' reports of symptoms worsening [2]. Such reports require patients' collaboration and judgment, which are frequently affected by their pronounced dyspnoea and anxiety associated with these events [7,8]. Physiologically, AECOPD are characterised by an increase in airway inflammation and obstruction, abnormal bronchial mucus production and marked air trapping [2], which results in changes in lung acoustics. As respiratory sounds are directly related to the movement of air within the tracheobronchial tree [9], the changes in respiratory mechanics related with AECOPD may be primarily detected by changes in respiratory sounds, namely adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS, crackles and wheezes). Recent studies have shown respiratory sounds ability to differentiate between groups of patients with stable and exacerbated COPD [10] and to characterise AECOPD into two phenotypes, based on computerised analysis [11]. Nevertheless, there is little information available on the time course of respiratory sounds changes during recovery from AECOPD, within the same group of patients. This information may advance the monitoring of patients with COPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings, as respiratory sounds are non-invasive, population-specific and nearly universally available by simple means [12]. Additionally, improved knowledge on ARS behaviour preceding, during and after an exacerbation may aid to standardise and optimise the length of treatment, and to plan appropriate follow-up and clinical studies involving AECOPD. This study aimed to evaluate ARS changes during the course of AECOPD. A secondary aim was to explore prospectively the influence of exacerbations in ARS in a subsample of patients with stable COPD followed by an AECOPD. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Study design and participants A longitudinal observational study was conducted in non-hospitalised patients with AECOPD recruited from the urgent care of a Central hospital between January 2016 and February 2017. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of AECOPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria [2]. A subsample of stable patients with COPD was recruited from routine pulmonology appointments of a Central hospital and asked to contact the researchers if an episode of exacerbation requiring hospital visit occurred. Patients were included if they were diagnosed with COPD according to the GOLD criteria and were clinically stable for 1 month prior to the study (no hospital admissions, exacerbations or changes in medication for the respiratory system) [2]. Exclusion criteria for both samples were hospitalisation or presence of severe co-existing respiratory, neurological, cardiac, musculoskeletal (e.g., kyphoscoliosis), or signs of psychiatric impairments. Eligible patients were identified by clinicians and contacted by the researchers, who explained the purpose of the study and asked about their willingness to participate. When subjects agreed to participate, an appointment with the researchers was scheduled. A group of healthy non-smokers, matched for gender, age and body mass index (BMI), were also recruited to serve as control, as currently there are no established reference values for ARS [13]. Healthy non-smokers were recruited from the university campus and surrounding community and excluded if they presented one or more of the following conditions: acute (within the past month) or chronic respiratory disease, cardiac disease, musculoskeletal or signs of psychiatric impairments. Approval for this study was obtained from the ethics committee of the Central Hospital (13NOV′1514:40065682) and of the University of Aveiro (8/2015) and from the National Data Protection Committee (8828/2016). Written informed consent was obtained before data collection. 2.2 Sample size A sample size estimation with 95% power at 5% significance determined that a significant difference in the inspiratory mean number of crackles obtained through repeated measures from patients with COPD at exacerbated (2.97 ± 1.98) and stable (1.20 ± 0.80) phases of their disease would be detected with a minimum of 23 participants [10]. A high statistical power was chosen due to the great amount of inter and intra subject variability presented by ARS [14,15], which could potentially cause type II errors if the study was underpowered [16]. In health-related longitudinal studies, dropout rates are of approximately 20–45% [17,18] thus, 36 participants with AECOPD were aimed to be recruited. Sample size estimation was performed using the G*Power 3.1 software (University Düsseldorf, Germany). 2.3 Data collection Participants with AECOPD recruited from the urgent care were asked to attend to 3 assessment sessions: at the exacerbation onset (T1 – 24–48 h of the hospital visit), 15 days (T2 – following exacerbation) [19,20] and 45 days after the hospital visit (T3 – at stability post exacerbation). The subsample of patients recruited from routine pulmonology appointments were asked to attend to 4 assessment sessions: 24–48 h after the pulmonology routine appointment (T0 – at stability pre exacerbation), at the exacerbation onset (T1 – 24–48 h of the hospital visit), 15 days (T2 – following exacerbation) [19,20] and 45 days after the hospital visit (T3 – at stability post exacerbation). Data from healthy non-smokers was only collected once (T0) (Fig. 1 ). Data collection occurred at the urgent care, in the facilities of the University of Aveiro or at patients' home. Sociodemographic (age, gender), anthropometric (height, weight and BMI) and general clinical data (smoking habits, number of exacerbations in the past year, medication and dyspnoea) were first collected. Dyspnoea was assessed with the modified British Medical Research Council questionnaire [21]. The questionnaire comprises five grades in a scale from 0 to 4, with higher grades indicating greater perceived dyspnoea. Then, computerised respiratory sounds (recorded as described below) and lung function, assessed with a portable spirometer (MicroLab 3535, CareFusion, Kent, UK) according to standardised guidelines were collected [22]. Respiratory sounds were collected in all data collection moments and spirometry was also performed at T3, during the stable phase, post exacerbation. All assessments were performed by a physiotherapist following the described standardised order. 2.4 Respiratory sound recordings Respiratory sound recordings followed computerised respiratory sound analysis guidelines for short-term acquisitions [23] (i.e., participants were in a seated-upright position, wearing a nose clip and were asked to breathe deeper than normal through the mouth). Recordings were performed simultaneously at 7 anatomic locations (trachea and right and left anterior, lateral, and posterior chest). The system for respiratory sound recordings included eight air-coupled electret microphones with 20–20000Hz frequency bandwidth (C 417 PP, AKG Acoustics GmbH, Vienna, Austria) [24]. a multi-channel audio interface (AudioBox 1818 VSL, PreSonus, Florida, USA), and a laptop computer running LungSounds@UA software [25]. Seven microphones, mounted in capsules made of Teflon [26,27], were attached on the participant's skin with double-faced adhesive tapes (Double Stick Discs, 3M Littmann, Cheshire, UK). The eighth microphone was placed close to the patient to record background noise. The analog sound signals acquired were amplified and converted to digital by the audio interface with a 24-bit resolution and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Each data acquisition session lasted for 20-s [28] and the recorded data were later converted to WAV format. 2.5 Signal processing All sound files were analysed using automatic algorithms implemented in Matlab R2009a (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts). Breathing cycles were semi-automatically detected using the algorithm developed by Huq and Moussavi (95.5% sensitivity and 95.6% specificity) [29]. Crackles were detected using a validated algorithm based on the combination of fractal dimension and box filtering techniques [30]. Wheezes were detected using an algorithm based on time-frequency analysis [31]. The mean number of crackles (total, fine and coarse) and wheeze occupation rate (%Wh – total, monophonic and polyphonic), per breathing phase (inspiration and expiration) and per chest location was extracted. Normal respiratory sounds were also analysed but were only slightly louder than the superimposed background sound so these data were excluded from further analyses (please see supplementary material 1). The average spectra of normal respiratory sounds at trachea, anterior and posterior chest can be found in the supplementary material 1 and a detailed description of the signal processing is provided elsewhere [32]. Lateral locations were also excluded from the analysis, as previous literature as shown that this anatomical location presents a great number of artefacts and is poorly reliable [15]. All analyses were checked by two respiratory experts to ensure the quality of the sound recordings. 2.6 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) and plots created using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The level of significance was set at 0.05. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample. Characteristics were compared between healthy non-smokers and patients with COPD at stable phases (T3) using independent t-tests for normally distributed data (i.e., BMI), Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-normally distributed data (i.e., age, lung function, packs-year) and ordinal data (i.e., mMRC), and Chi-square tests for categorical data (i.e., gender, smoking status and exacerbations/year). Computerised ARS data were explored for each of the five analysed locations; however, no significant differences were found between right and left chest of the same region (i.e., anterior, lateral or posterior), thus, to simplify the interpretability of the findings, data from right and left were pooled for each chest region [32]. Then, the number of participants with crackles and wheezes in each chest region was calculated and the Cochran test with Bonferroni corrections was used to compare number of participants presenting crackles and wheezes among T1, T2 and T3. Fisher's exact test was used to investigate differences between healthy non-smokers and patients with COPD at stable phases (T3) on the number of participants presenting crackles and wheezes. Comparisons of number of crackles and %Wh among T1, T2 and T3 in patients with COPD were performed with the Friedman test, and multiple comparisons with the Wilcoxon sign-rank test. Multiple comparisons were corrected for number of comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. Comparisons between healthy non-smokers and patients with COPD at stable phases regarding mean number of crackles and %Wh was performed with Mann–Whitney U test. When statistically significant differences were found for the number of crackles or %Wh, a comparison of the type of crackles or wheezes was also performed. An additional analysis, similar to the described previously for patients recruited at the onset of the AECOPD, was conducted with the subsample of patients presenting data collected prior to the exacerbation. 3 Results 3.1 Participants Seventy-four non-hospitalised patients with AECOPD were referred for possible inclusion in the study. Of these, 34 patients refereed with AECOPD were excluded because at T1 they had pulmonary function test not compatible with a diagnosis of COPD (n = 22), did not meet the definition for AECOPD (n = 1), presented lung neoplasia (n = 2), severe heart failure (n = 1), were unable to comply with data collection (n = 3), or declined to participate in the study (n = 5). Fifteen patients were further excluded from the analysis because failed to complete all time points of data collection (i.e., T1, T2 and T3) (n = 6) and their respiratory sounds (collected at the urgent care) had a significant amount of background noise hindering the use of the algorithms described in the Signal processing section (n = 9). Thirty-four healthy non-smokers were also contacted and invited to participate. Thus, twenty-five participants with AECOPD (16 males; 70 [62.5–77.0] years old; FEV1 59 [31.5–73.0]% predicted) and thirty-four healthy non-smokers (17 male; 63.5 [57.7–72.3] years old; FEV1 103.0 [88.8–125.3]% predicted) were enrolled in the study. Participants' characteristics are summarised in Table 1 . A subsample of 9 participants with stable COPD a priori was also included and followed up until an AECOPD occurred and during its recovery. This sub-group of participants (7 males; 66 [60.0–76.0] years old; FEV1 62 [26.5–74.0]% predicted) was slightly overweight (27.9 ± 4.46 kg/m2), presented a median number of packs/year of 21.2 [10.0–30.0] and were mainly former smokers (n = 5; 55.6%; current smokers: n = 2; 22.2%; never smokers: n = 2; 22.2%). Most participants were classified as being in a stage D of the GOLD classification (n = 5; 55.6%; GOLD B: n = 2; 22.2%; GOLD C: n = 2; 22.2%), presented more than 2 AECOPD in the past year (n = 6; 66.7%; 1 AECOPD: n = 2; 22.2%; 0 AECOPD: n = 1; 11.1%) and were treated for their AECOPD with antibiotics (n = 5; 56%), cholinergic antagonist bronchodilators (n = 2; 22%), anti-inflammatory bronchodilators (n = 1; 11%) and expectorants (n = 3; 33%). Patients presented a median mMRC of 2 [1–3]. Median time to exacerbation was 23 [18–146] days. 3.2 Computerised respiratory sounds 3.2.1 Crackles Significant differences were found in the total number of inspiratory (p = 0.008) and coarse (p = 0.003) crackles within patients with AECOPD at T1, T2 and T3 at the posterior chest. Patients presented significantly more inspiratory (p = 0.013) and coarse (p = 0.013) crackles at T1 than at T3. Fig. 2 presents the number of crackles at each chest region in healthy participants and patients with AECOPD. A detailed characterisation of crackles can be found in the supplementary material 2. Patients with stable COPD presented significantly more inspiratory crackles (p = 0.012), both fine (p = 0.003) and coarse (p = 0.013) crackles, at the posterior chest than healthy participants. No significant differences were found regarding the remaining variables, locations or respiratory phases (p > 0.05). 3.2.2 Wheezes Significant differences were found in the inspiratory %Wh (p = 0.019) and inspiratory monophonic %Wh (p = 0.012), within patients with AECOPD at T1, T2 and T3 at posterior chest. Namely, patients presented significantly more inspiratory %Wh (p = 0.006) and monophonic %Wh (p = 0.045) at T1 than at T2. A higher number of patients presenting inspiratory wheezes and monophonic wheezes were found at T1 than at T2 at trachea (p = 0.037) and anterior chest region (p = 0.014). The number of patients with expiratory monophonic wheezes was also higher at T1 than at T3 at the anterior chest (p = 0.029). No significant differences were found regarding the remaining variables, locations and respiratory phases (p > 0.05). Fig. 3 presents the %Wh at each chest region in healthy participants and patients with AECOPD. A detailed characterisation of wheezes can be found in the supplementary material 3. Patients with stable COPD presented significantly more expiratory and monophonic %Wh, both at anterior (total %Wh: p < 0.001; monophonic %Wh: p = 0.007) and posterior (total %Wh: p = 0.001; monophonic %Wh: p < 0.001) chest regions than healthy participants. No differences were found regarding the number of healthy participants and stable patients with wheezes (p > 0.05). 3.2.3 Sub-analysis No differences were found among the four-time points of data collection for inspiratory and expiratory crackles and wheezes at all anatomical locations (p > 0.05), in the subsample of patients with stable COPD a priori. A detailed characterisation of the respiratory sounds of this subsample can be found in the supporting information 4 and 5. 4 Discussion The main findings of this study were that inspiratory crackles and wheezes change significantly during the course of AECOPD and patients with stable COPD presented significantly more inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheezes than healthy peers. Differences in ARS found during the course of AECOPD and between stable patients with COPD and healthy peers were mainly observed at posterior and more peripheral chest locations, both for crackles and wheezes. In previous studies, the posterior region has been indicated as the most reliable and valid chest location for auscultation in patients with COPD [14,15]. These findings, added to physiological and epidemiological data showing that COPD is primarily targeted by smaller airway and/or alveolar abnormalities [2] and that approximately 70–80% of AECOPD are due to infections, especially of the small airways [33], might lead us to confidently identify the posterior chest region as the preferred location of auscultation to monitor patients with COPD. Coarse crackles and monophonic wheezes during inspiration were the respiratory sounds parameters presenting significant degrees of change. Previous research, conducted in independent samples of stable and exacerbated patients with COPD, has shown equivalent results for the number of coarse crackles [10], despite acknowledging that respiratory tract infections, the main cause of AECOPD, are mainly characterised by fine crackles. Such results have been attributed to the frequency response of stethoscopes used which might be cutting high frequencies of interest, and consequently affecting fine crackles detection [34]. Thus, a deeper understanding of this matter is yet needed. Respiratory tract infections define a wide range of infectious diseases, including pneumonia, acute bronchitis, AECOPD and acute infective exacerbations of asthma [35]. Pneumonia is the respiratory infection most studied for ARS [36]. It should be emphasised that AECOPD and pneumonia differ greatly in their pathophysiology [2,36]. AECOPD are characterised by an increase in airway inflammation and obstruction, abnormal bronchial mucus and marked air trapping [2], whilst pneumonia usually presents lung consolidation and a filling of the alveolar air spaces with exudate, inflammatory cells, and fibrin [36]. Accordingly, AECOPD are more prompt to develop hypersecretions than pneumonia and thus, generate more coarse crackles, which “indicates intermittent airway opening related to secretions”, than fine crackles that are “unrelated to secretions” [12]. Contrary to what has been reported in previous literature [10], only inspiratory wheezes presented significant changes during the course of AECOPD. Compared to crackles, wheezes usually present higher inter subject variability [14] and, in patients with more severe airway obstruction, expiratory wheezes have been indicated as a poorly reliable parameter, as they are strongly influenced by air-flow and respiratory manoeuvres [15]. Because previous research has been conducted using independent samples of patients with stable and AECOPD, variability might be increased, explaining the differences found. Also, previous studies have included mainly mild to moderate patients with COPD [10,37], whilst our sample included mostly severe patients, where inspiratory wheezes might be more representative. Considering the changes in ARS during the course of AECOPD, %Wh, specifically monophonic, significantly decreased after 15 days of treatment (i.e., approximate time needed to resolve an AECOPD [19]), whilst crackles, specifically coarse crackles, only decreased significantly after 45 days post-exacerbation. Previous studies conducted during an AECOPD have shown an improvement in air-flow limitation (assessed by FEV1 and peak expiratory flow - PEF) approximately 15-days post exacerbation [7,19]. Knowing that %Wh is highly associated with the degree of bronchial obstruction [38,39], this was an expected result and enhances the role of wheezes auscultation to monitor AECOPD. Crackles are more related to changes (i.e., inflammation and/or infection) in more peripheral airways which usually take longer to resolve [40,41]. No differences were observed in the subsample of patients with stable COPD studied a priori and during AECOPD across any time points. Thus, it was not possible to demonstrate if ARS recovered to baseline characteristics after an exacerbation, or if AECOPD have a cumulative effect in ARS similar to other outcomes, such as muscle strength and lung function [5]. It is known that ARS present high inter and intra subject variability [14] and thus, the sample size included in this sub-analysis might have been insufficient to detect significant changes. Nevertheless, if ARS are to be used clinically, knowing their evolution before and after exacerbations is essential to better interpret and manage treatment. This sub-analysis was therefore a needed first step towards ARS use in the monitoring of AECOPD and can be used as a pilot study to compute sample sizes in future studies (data are in supporting information 4 and 5). Patients with COPD presented significantly more inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheezes than healthy peers. It is known that COPD is mainly characterised by inspiratory and coarse crackles and expiratory wheezes [42], when compared with other chronic diseases, such as fibrosis, asthma, pneumonia, bronchiectasis and heart failure. Thus, this was an expected result. However, few studies have compared ARS in healthy people and patients with COPD, even though the presence of ARS has been recognised in healthy people [13]. Although differences in ARS were found between patients with COPD and healthy people, the number of people with ARS in both groups was not significantly different. Therefore, our results further enhance the recommendation of not using the presence of ARS as an indicator of pathology [15], but instead investigate ARS characteristics (i.e., number, type, position in the respiratory cycle) and place it together with other clinical findings. Comparing to previous studies, a small number of crackles and low %Wh were found in patients with COPD (median no. of crackles per respiratory phase between 0.3 in stable patients to 0.6 in AECOPD; median %Wh of approximately 0) and healthy people (median no. of crackles and %Wh of approximately 0). Studies have been indicating a mean number of crackles between 0.8 and 5 per respiratory phase and a mean %Wh of 0.79% to approximately 10% in patients with COPD [10,42,43] and approximately 1.5 crackles and 35% %Wh in healthy people [32]. Reasons for these differences might be explained by the different protocols used to collect and analyse ARS. In this study, ARS were collected using AKG air-coupled electret microphones (response rate 20–20000Hz) mounted in capsules made of Teflon to minimise noise and increase sound transmission [26,27]. Additionally, all participants, independently of having ARS or not, were included in the analysis to potentiate the comprehensiveness and generalisation of our findings. Previous studies have used sensors with different frequency responses (e.g., 40–15000Hz [32]; 50–1800Hz; 4–20000Hz; 65–20000Hz [42]), diverse set ups of data collection (e.g., electret microphones imbedded in a soft foam mat and electret condenser microphones connected to the diaphragm or main tube of conventional stethoscopes [10,42,43]) and analysis (have only included in their analysis people presenting ARS [32]). Such variety of procedures may produce recordings of different quality and range of sound spectrum, influencing the results achieved and thus impairing comparisons among studies. 5 Limitations This study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, treatment of exacerbations during this study was not standardised, but rather prescribed according to the physician best judgment and clinical indication. Although for the purpose of this study the effects of therapies used were not of interest, it has to be acknowledge that different combination of drugs might have influenced the recovery times and outcomes of individual patients. Secondly, flows and/or volumes were not controlled during ARS recordings, which might have affected the results, since ARS characteristics depend on the rate and volume of the respiratory manoeuvres [44]. However, patients with AECOPD often present severe dyspnoea and anxiety [7,8] which causes the use of a mouthpiece or facemask (necessary to assess flows and/or volumes) to be highly uncomfortable or even not tolerated. Furthermore, the primary purpose of this study was to assess computerised ARS utility in a community-based clinical setting, where control of airflow is often not practical. Thirdly, the complex set up used to record ARS may be perceived as a limitation to the use of computerised respiratory sounds in the clinical practice. Future research should focus in developing technologies for acquiring high quality data at bedside with minimal setup. Finally, although statistically significant differences were found for inspiratory number of crackles and %Wh at posterior regions, the absolute differences among data collection times were small and possibly not detected by health professionals with standard auscultation. Thus, it is imperative that future studies explore the minimal clinical important difference of ARS to enhance the clinical meaning of this measure and potentiate the development and implementation of friendly used computerised auscultation systems that can be translated into clinical practice. 6 Conclusion Inspiratory crackles and wheezes changed significantly during the course of AECOPD, and patients with stable COPD presented significantly more inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheezes than healthy peers. Inspiratory crackles seem to persist until 15 days after the exacerbations (i.e., approximate time needed to resolve AECOPD) whilst inspiratory %Wh significantly decreased after this period. Crackles and wheezes seem to be sensitive to monitor the course of AECOPD. This information may allow further advances in the monitoring of patients with COPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings, as respiratory sounds are non-invasive, population-specific and nearly universally available by simple means. Further studies with larger samples and including data collected before the AECOPD are needed to confirm these findings. Conflicts of interest None.

However, CRS measurement properties have been poorly tested. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the reliability, validity and the minimal detectable changes (MDC) of CRS in patients with stable COPD. Methods: Fifty patients (36♂, 67.26 ± 9.31y, FEV1 49.52 ± 19.67%predicted) were enrolled. CRS were recorded simultaneously at seven anatomic locations (trachea; right and left anterior, lateral and posterior chest). The number of crackles, wheeze occupation rate, median frequency (F50) and maximum intensity (Imax) were processed using validated algorithms. Within-day and between-days reliability, criterion and construct validity, validity to predict exacerbations and MDC were established. Results: CRS presented moderate-to-excellent within-day reliability (ICC1,3 ≥ 0.51; P <.05) and moderate-to-good between-days reliability (ICC1,2 ≥ 0.47; P <.05) for most locations. Negligible-to-moderate correlations with FEV1%predicted were found (–0.53 < rs < –0.28; P <.05), and the inspiratory number of crackles were the best discriminator between mild-to-moderate and severe-to-very severe airflow limitations (area under the curve >0.78). CRS correlated poorly with patient-reported outcomes (rs < 0.48; P <.05) and did not predict exacerbations. Inspiratory number of crackles at posterior right chest, inspiratory F50 at trachea and anterior left chest and expiratory Imax at anterior right chest were simultaneously reliable and valid, and their MDC were 2.41, 55.27, 29.55 and 3.98, respectively. Conclusion: CRS are reliable and valid. Their use, integrated with other clinical and patient-reported measures, may fill the gap of assessing small airways and contribute toward a patient's comprehensive evaluation.",

Computer-assisted learning tools (CALTs) have potential to enhance the learning of these skills; however, few have been developed for this purpose and do not integrate all the required features. Thus, this study aimed to assess the usability of a new CALT for learning pulmonary auscultation. Computerized Lung Auscultation–Sound Software (CLASS) usability was assessed by eight physiotherapy students using computer screen recordings, think-aloud reports, and facial expressions. Time spent in each task, frequency of messages and facial expressions, number of clicks and problems reported were counted. The timelines of the three methods used were matched/synchronized and analyzed. The tasks exercises and annotation of respiratory sounds were the ones requiring more clicks (median 132, interquartile range [23–157]; 93 [53–155]; 91 [65–104], respectively) and where most errors (19; 37; 15%, respectively) and problems (n = 7; 6; 3, respectively) were reported. Each participant reported a median of 6 problems, with a total of 14 different problems found, mainly related with CLASS functionalities (50%). Smile was the only facial expression presented in all tasks (n = 54). CLASS is the only CALT available that meets all the required features for learning pulmonary auscultation. The combination of the three usability methods identified advantages/disadvantages of CLASS and offered guidance for future developments, namely in annotations and exercises. This will allow the improvement of CLASS and enhance students’ activities for learning pulmonary auscultation skills.",

For this purpose, we developed new procedures to identify symmetric word pairs with uncommon empirical distance distribution and with clusters of overrepresented short distances. We speculate that patterns of overrepresentation of short distances between symmetric word pairs may allow the occurrence of non-standard DNA conformations, such as hairpin/cruciform structures. We focused on the human genome, and analysed both the complete genome as well as a version with known repetitive sequences masked out. We reported several well-defined features in the distributions of distances, which can be classified into three different profiles, showing enrichment in distinct distance ranges. We analysed in greater detail certain pairs of symmetric words of length seven, found by our procedure, characterised by the surprising fact that they occur at single distances more frequently than expected.",

It is a somewhat broadly defined concept, which has been refined into some more specific measurable effects. Here we discuss the exceptional symmetry effect. Exceptional symmetry is the symmetry effect beyond that expected in independence contexts, and it can be measured for each word, for each equivalent composition group, or globally, combining the effects of all possible words of a given length. Global exceptional symmetry was found in several species, but there are genomic words with no exceptional symmetry effect, whereas others show a very high exceptional symmetry effect. In this work, we discuss a measure to evaluate the exceptional symmetry effect by symmetric word pair, and compare it with others. We present a detailed study of the exceptional symmetry by symmetric pairs and take the CG content into account. We also introduce and discuss the exceptional symmetry profile for the DNA of each organism, and we perform a multiple comparison for 31 genomes: 7 viruses; 5 archaea; 5 bacteria; 14 eukaryotes.",

However, parity of the frequencies of reverse complementary oligonucleotides could be a mere consequence of the single nucleotide parity rule, if nucleotide independence is assumed. Exceptional symmetry (symmetry beyond that expected under an independent nucleotide assumption) was proposed previously as a meaningful measure of the extension of the second parity rule to oligonucleotides. The global exceptional symmetry was detected in long and short genomes. Results: To explore the exceptional genomic word symmetry along the genome sequences, we propose a sliding window method to extract the values of exceptional symmetry (for all words or by word groups). We compare the exceptional symmetry effect size distribution in all human chromosomes against control scenarios (positive and negative controls), testing the differences and performing a residual analysis. We explore local exceptional symmetry in equivalent composition word groups, and find that the behaviour of the local exceptional symmetry depends on the word group. Conclusions: We conclude that the exceptional symmetry is a local phenomenon in genome sequences, with distinct characteristics along the sequence of each chromosome. The local exceptional symmetry along the genomic sequences shows outlying segments, and those segments have high biological annotation density.",

Our results show that adding a small size in-domain bilingual terminology to the small in-domain training corpus leads to the best improvements of a hybrid MT system, while the PBSMT system achieves the best results by adding a combination of in-domain bilingual terminology and a larger out-of-domain corpus. We focus on qualitative human evaluation of the output of two best systems (one for each approach) and perform a systematic in-depth error analysis which revealed advantages of the hybrid MT system over the pure PBSMT system for this specific task.",

However, in random sequences generated under an independent symbol model where complementary nucleotides have equal occurrence probabilities, we expect the phenomenon of symmetry to hold for any word length. In this work, we develop new statistical methods to measure the exceptional symmetry. Exceptional symmetry is a refinement of Chargaff's second parity rule that highlights the words whose frequency of occurrence is similar to that of its reversed complement but dissimilar to the frequencies of occurrence of other words which contain the same number of nucleotides A or T. We analyze words of lengths up to 12 in the complete human genome and in each chromosome separately. We assess exceptional symmetry globally, by word group, and by word. We conclude that the global symmetry present in the human genome is clearly exceptional and significant. The chromosomes present distinct exceptional symmetry profiles. There are several exceptional word groups and exceptional words with a strong exceptional symmetry.",

Introduction Respiratory diseases are among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Thus, great research efforts have been devoted to improve their diagnosis and monitoring through technological improvements of lung auscultation as it is a non-invasive, economic and universally available tool2. For the last three decades, scientific research has been contributing for improving the equipment to acquire respiratory sounds (RS)3 and for *Corresponding author.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license Peer-review under responsibility of SciKA - Association for Promotion and Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge 698 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 enhancing the understanding of the clinical meaning of changes occurring in RS4,5. However, these new advances in science have been poorly translated to health professionalsâ€™ academic education6. The education and training of a â€œhands-on professionâ€�, such as health related professions, in an academic setting is challenging as it requires the rationale and the skills to manage authentic patient scenarios, whilst the training is routinely provided with healthy subjects7. Specifically for lung auscultation, it requires the development of skills to: i) understand the principles of acoustics, ii) distinguish between RS and sound artefacts that may be heard in clinical environments (i.e., speech, movement and articular noise resulting from holding the stethoscope), iii) differentiate between normal and adventitious sounds, iv) relate the auscultation with other patientâ€™s characteristics and v) build a clinical rationale based on these parameters6,8. Such skills can be achieved by listening repeatedly to recordings of typical RS without artefacts (such as low and high frequency crackles and wheezes) and visualising their waveforms, but also by identifying these typical RS in recordings acquired from real patients and in clinical environments. Nevertheless, real patients and clinical environments are difficult to find and/or mimic in academic contexts and learning tools are difficult to transport to clinical environments7. Computer-assisted learning tools may help to overcome these difficulties, since they allow students interaction with RS previously recorded in real clinical contexts and from patients with different pathologies, whilst ensuring patient confidentiality7. Also, if properly developed, the computerised learning tool may be suitable to be used by students in their clinical placements where a large variety of cases can be presented and recorded for posterior analysis and discussion. Few computer-assisted learning tools have been developed in the area of respiratory medicine6 and the existing tools do not integrate the latest scientific advances on RS9,10 (e.g., updated nomenclature and clinical interpretation) and/or do not contemplate all the required features for integration of knowledge (e.g., sound recording and analysis)11,12. Furthermore, these tools have not been successfully implemented in academic settings, as it has been reported that most used learning tools in respiratory medicine are still books, standard sounds and websites6. Therefore, we aimed to develop and evaluate a computer-assisted learning application for RS recording, analysis and interpretation. Accordingly, this paper is organised as follows: section 2 presents the tools and methods used to design the application; section 3 describes the results obtained after the usability session, when using CLASS as a learning tool for RS; section 4 discusses the benefits and drawbacks identified in the usability session, and section 5 concludes the paper and presents future work directions. 2. Methodology Computerised Lung Auscultation â€“ Sound System (CLASS) is an open-source application that has been developed based on two previous applications: LungSounds@UA11 and RSAS@UA12. These two applications do not integrate recording and analysis of RS and were developed for research purposes only, using a proprietary software that requires a commercial license (i.e., Matlab). To overcome these drawbacks and take into consideration studentsâ€™ needs, CLASS has been developed in Java, a free and open-source object-oriented programming language. Moreover, Java applications are executed on Java Virtual Machines (JVM) that can be easily installed in most computer platforms. This promotes its use across different operating systems (e.g., Unix, Linux, OS X and Windows)13. 2.1. Design Principles The CLASS application was designed using a User-Centred Design (UCD) process14. UCD facilitates usersâ€™ workflow throughout the application as it supports their current habits and behaviours, instead of requiring them to adapt to the application14. A task-oriented prototyping technique in the analysis requirements phase was used to identify the tasks that users needed to accomplish with the application15. Therefore, users were able to test each task independently during the development of the application (prototypes), whilst other tasks were being developed concurrently. 699 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 2.2. Application structure The application, currently available in English, is organised using tabbed document interfaces (TDI), so that its main features can be displayed in sections easily identified and accessed by the user. This organisation also makes the application visually more pleasant and intuitive16. The application includes: RS recordings with a digital stethoscope; RS files playback; RS files analysis; learning exercises for RS identification and tutorials on RS acoustic properties together with their clinical interpretation. 2.2.1. Authentication The navigation starts with the validation of usersâ€™ credentials to assure data integrity and confidentiality17, through the authentication window, as shown in Fig.1 (a). Then, a main window (see Fig.1 (b)) is displayed containing four TDIs on the top of the page: Main; Recordings; Annotations and Tutorials. The Main TDI is composed of two panels, as shown in Fig.1 (b). Panel P1 displays information about the number of exercises performed by the user, average evaluation of the submitted exercises, number of exercises that reached 80% of agreement on adventitious RS detection (comparing with a multi-annotator gold standard) and current exercise level (i.e., beginner or advanced). Panel P2 presents the user personal information (username and role). 2.2.2. Recordings The Recording TDI is composed of 4 panels as shown in Fig.2 (a). Panel P3 allows to select patients from a pre- configured list, to configure the session (i.e., to select whether the recording is performed before or after the treatment session) and to select the anatomical location where the recording will be performed (i.e., trachea and left and right anterior, lateral and posterior locations). In panel P4 users can select the acquisition device to perform the RS recording and, if applicable, the device used for flow and volume acquisition. The latter is not mandatory to proceed with the RS acquisition. Panel P5 allows RS recordings. After pressing the recording bottom, a recording window (see Fig.2 (b)), with a real time waveform of the acoustic signal being collected, is displayed. A time countdown is visualised (20 seconds are defined by default, but this duration can be modified), and after that, the user is redirected to the Annotations TDI, where annotation of the recorded RS can be performed. Finally, panel P6 is composed by a table containing information about the previously recorded RS for the patient selected in panel P3: recording date and time; anatomical location; session and filename. Also, users may select a RS from the table to: annotate that sound; repeat the recording; remove the sound from the list. Figure 1. (a)Authentication window. (b) Main tabbed document interface. 700 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 2.2.3. Annotations The Annotation TDI (see Fig.3(a)) allows users to playback RS files and to manually annotate respiratory phases and adventitious RS, i.e., wheezes and crackles. The process for sound playback and/or annotation starts in panel P7, where users can list and select a specific RS, depending on the patient, clinical condition or exercise level they are interested in. After RS selection, the sound is displayed in panel P8 in a waveform display and users may play the sound and/or activate the noise filter. This will filter frequencies below 100 Hz and higher than 2000 Hz, which are outside the bandwidth of interest to detect adventitious RS18, and thus will facilitate the annotation process. The sound volume and reproducing rate (i.e., reduction of the reproducing rate to half of the normal rate or reproduction at normal rate) can also be selected in this panel19,20. This will further facilitate the accurate annotation of the beginning and end of a respiratory phase and/or adventitious RS. The annotation process and management of annotations are available in panels P9, P10 and P11. Here, users can select which annotation information (i.e., crackles, wheezes and respiratory phases or all) they want to see in the plot along with the RS waveform, manage annotation data (add or remove annotation, clear annotation list and change annotation type) and submit annotations. After submitting an annotation, the user can visualise it by selecting the corresponding RS file. The Annotations TDI also allows users to train their skills on RS annotation, by annotating pre-selected RS files and comparing their annotations with a multi-annotator gold standard (i.e., a set of annotations performed by at least three different respiratory experts). These exercises are divided into two levels: beginner and advanced. At a beginner level, users simply select a RS file from the â€œexercisesâ€� list (presented in panel P7) and perform its annotation. After submitting their annotation, users receive a report on their percentage of agreement with the gold standard, as well as a visual feedback of his/her performance, i.e., the gold standard annotation overlaps with the annotation performed by the user (presented in yellow in Fig.3(a), panel P8). After five annotations with at least Figure 2. (a) Recording tabbed document interface; (b) Recording performance window. Figure 3. (a) Annotation tabbed document interface (b) Tutorials tabbed document interface 701 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 80% of agreement with the gold standard, the advanced level of exercises becomes available. In this level, users are presented with a RS file previously automatically annotated and have to verify if those annotations are correct and if the RS is fully annotated. If these premises are not verified, the exercise consists of performing the required corrections. After exercise submission, the process is similar to what has been previously described for the beginner level. 2.2.4. Tutorials The Tutorials TDI, shown in Fig.3 (b), has two entries containing normal and adventitious RS. For each sound, the user can visualise the RS waveform, play the sound and learn about the clinical features usually related with that type of sound, according to the most recent findings of RS classification4. 2.3. Usability assessments CLASS was developed and iteratively assessed (with informal evaluations) during its design process by identifying the problems that users (four independent respiratory researchers) had when interacting with the application and performing the required corrections to solve those problems. Then, when a final version of CLASS was produced, it was submitted to a formal usability panel composed of eight physiotherapy students without any prior knowledge of the application and its general structure. Prior to the usability panel session, all participants gave their informed consents, answered a background questionnaire about their expertise and usage of computer applications21 and enrolled in an exploratory and instruction-based training session22 for approximately 60 minutes. Participants also received training manuals describing the general structure of CLASS. Two researchers involved in the development of the application (the first and third authors) were present during the training session23-25. Two days after the training session, eight validation sessions were performed. Students were distributed in individual rooms in each validation session. Each student received a pre structured case study. The case study followed the workflow scenario of a patient with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease who went to a hospital and had his/her RS recorded by a health professional for further analysis. The case study also included an evaluation of the participantsâ€™ skills to detect adventitious RS by asking them to perform a beginner and an advanced exercise. After completing the case study, participants were asked to fill in a user experience questionnaire26 and to participate in a focus group interview27, to gain insight into their experience when interacting with the application. The focus group themes were selected following a semi-structured discussion guide28 and included: relevance, ease of navigation, alert messages, design, layout and content organisation, areas of application, problems and suggestions for improving CLASS. The focus group interview lasted for approximately 20 minutes and was video recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. 3. Results Participants (3 male; 20.5 Â± 0.5 years) had previous experience with software applications either for academic (n=8; 100%) or leisure purposes (n=6; 75%). One participant reported having had previous bad experiences with software applications and three students (38%) reported having already used an application similar to CLASS. In the post session questionnaires, participants stated that the application was easy (n=8; 100%) and pleasant to use (n=7; 88%), that it had good design (n=7; 88%) and was consistent regarding the order in which the contents were displayed (n=8; 100%). However, five participants (63%) reported that they were not able to be independent in their interaction with the application and two (25%) found some annoying characteristics, such as the gold standard appearing suddenly after the submission of the annotations and the absence of a timeline in the annotation process. 3.1. Focus group interview The results obtained in the eight pre-established themes for the focus group are presented below. 702 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 Relevance: Five participants (63%) agreed that CLASS is a useful application. The importance of having the Tutorials TDI was highly emphasised, as it provides a valuable platform to learn about the RS characteristics. Ease of navigation: Most participants (n=6; 75%) agreed that CLASS is easy to navigate and perform tasks and that the TDI organisation was a smart approach, which facilitated the navigation. Alert messages: Six participants (75%) agreed that alert messages were understandable and helpful. However, since all messages appeared in red, users felt that they were committing errors all the time. Design: All participants (n=8; 100%) thought that CLASS had a simple, efficient and functional design. Layout and content organisation: Two participants (25%) agreed that the content presented on the application was well chosen and four (50%) further stated that the application did not need any additional content to be useful for academic purposes. Areas of application: Six participants (75%) stated that, if available, they would use CLASS for educational purposes, instead the classic learning tools (i.e., books, standard RS recordings and websites). They pointed out the fact that having CLASS as an educational tool, would make them more prepared for clinical placements, since they would be able to recognise adventitious RS ahead of actually being with patients. It was also stated by six participants (75%) that the use of CLASS in clinical placements would be of great value, as it would allow to record patientsâ€™ auscultations and then perform a more detailed analysis at home. Three participants (38%) also reported that CLASS would allow students to objectify their findings before and after treatment, as it allows analysis of RS recordings at different instances in time. Problems: All participants reported difficulties recording and/or annotating RS. Five participants (63%) stated that after performing a RS recording, it was not clear which steps were required to save the RS file. Also, after saving the recording (see Fig.2 (b)), the patient in which the recording was being performed, was automatically deselected in the recording configuration window (see Fig.2 (a), panel P3), causing participants to have to reselect the patient every time they wanted to record a different anatomical site of auscultation. Five participants (63%) also reported difficulties in inserting respiratory phases and adventitious RS, mainly due to the absence of a dynamic time cursor, which would follow the waveform while the sound was played back. Editing difficulties were due to the absence of an edit option, i.e., every time participants made a mistake in inserting a respiratory phase or adventitious RS, that annotation had to be deleted and inserted again. It was also mentioned by two participants (25%) that the application did not allow them to change between TDIs without losing unsaved annotations. This was pointed as the major limitation of the application, since it did not allow participants to consult the tutorials while they were performing the annotations. Suggestions: Regarding the Recording TDI, two participants (25%) suggested that the â€œsession typeâ€� (see Fig. 2, panel P3) should have an intermediate option, to allow students to record patientsâ€™ RS not only at beginning and end of the treatment session, but also between the application of different physiotherapy techniques in the same session. In the Annotation TDI (see Fig. 3(a)), five participants (63%) suggested that undo/redo buttons should be added to allow users to go backward and forward during the annotation process. Participants also suggested replacing the RS list with encoded identifications by a table with the RS characteristics, as it is presented in the Recordings TDI (see Fig. 2 (a), panel P6). All participants suggested the insertion of a vertical time cursor in the waveform plot, so they could have a visual feedback of the RS time instant they were currently listening. Regarding to the presentation of the gold-standard, it was suggested that this should not automatically appear when an annotation is performed. Instead, users should have the option to select it, if and when he/she wants to visualise it. Two participants (25%) also suggested changing the colours in which the gold standard was being presented to distinguish it from the userâ€™s annotation. Four participants (50%) stated that the use of CLASS in lectures and clinical placements would increase the interest of students about lung auscultation. Hence, it was suggested that it could be inserted in studentsâ€™ curricular plan and workshops could be developed to those who were already in clinical placements. 4. Discussion This study presented a computer-assisted learning application (CLASS) to be used by students in academic and clinical placements for learning purposes. The usability evaluation conducted with the application highlighted its great potential to boosts studentsâ€™ skills on lung auscultation. Moreover, the use of CLASS may potentiate studentsâ€™ motivation to use auscultation later in their clinical practice. 703 JosÃ© Semedo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 697 â€“ 704 CLASS combines in a single application a learning tool that can be used to teach both RS acquisition and interpretation. Also, being multi-platform and based on open source components, it can run in studentsâ€™ personal computers and thus be taken to their clinical placements, enabling the learning process to be extended outside of the academic environment. This advantage is not found in any similar existing RS applications, such as MARS Database29, LungSounds@UA11 and RSAT@UA12. Although authors claimed that those applications could also be used for learning purposes29, there are no reports of usability validation tests occurring with Health Sciences students. Also, none of these tools integrate recording, annotation and tutorials about RS in the same application. Recently, some educational websites have emerged which integrate RS recordings and exercises for diagnosis training30,31. Although very useful to train auscultation in RS recordings without artefacts, these websites do not provide examples of RS recordings in real clinical environments, where the sound file is often contaminated with several artefacts that need to be distinguished from RS. Additionally, only examples of specific auscultation places, mostly lower lobes and trachea, are provided. It is known that RS characteristics differ from upper, middle and lower lobes32, and thus it is essential to train students to recognise and understand those differences, as it is possible with CLASS. The potential of the application to be used in clinical placements was the advantage most highlighted by participants in the focus group. Participants valued the fact that, by using CLASS, they could share and discuss their annotations pre (base) and post a physiotherapy treatment with their tutors and peers. It is known that although students appreciate computer tutorials acting as a supplement to their educational activities, they do not favour them as the primary or exclusive method of education delivery7. In fact, they perceive their interaction with other classmates and lecturers as an integral part of the learning process7. Hence, although CLASS is a computer-assisted learning application, that allows students to record and analyse their own sound files, it creates the opportunity to generate scientific discussions between lecturers and students, addressing doubts that may never emerge with the isolated RS sound files usually used in the conventional teaching method. This may not only motivate students, but also instructors as they might feel students more engaged in their own learning process33. Despite the great number of advantages reported by participants, some suggestions were given for future improvements, namely regarding the gold standard visualisation, alert messages design, RS recording/storage procedures, patientâ€™s selection remembrance between tasks, inclusion of a timeline during RS playback, annotation editing and navigation between TDIs during an annotation session. 5. Conclusion and Future Work The design of successful computer-assisted learning applications is one of the main challenges in the area of respiratory medicine6. According to our best knowledge, CLASS is the only computer-assisted learning tool that simultaneously allows recording and analysis of RS. Despite of the drawbacks addressed in the usability assessment, the utility has great potential to be used both in academic and clinical environments. New developments are being implemented to meet usersâ€™ requirements, and new standardised evaluation models are being analysed for future usability assessments, such as the USE-IT and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires. An improved version of this application is also being prepared to be used by health professionalsâ€™ and researchers in their practice.

However, few have been developed in the area of respiratory medicine and the majority does not include all the required features for integration of knowledge (e.g., sound recording and analysis). Thus, we aimed to develop and evaluate an open-source computer-assisted learning application for respiratory sound recording, analysis and interpretation, the Computerised Lungs Auscultation – Sound Software (CLASS). CLASS is the only computer-assisted learning tool which simultaneously allows the recording and analyses of respiratory sounds. The usability of CLASS has been tested by eight physiotherapy students through an open-ended questionnaire and a focus group interview. Participants highlighted its utility and great potential to be used in academic and clinical environments, and they also identified some drawbacks. New developments are being incorporated to improve CLASS usability in the academic context but also to make it available in health professionals’ clinical practice.

Introduction Respiratory diseases are a major health and economic burden worldwide1. Therefore, during the last decade, research efforts have been dedicated to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory diseases2. The stethoscope has been used for 200 years to perform lung auscultation during clinical examinations as it is simple, non-invasive, economic, practical and applicable to all populations and settings3. However, it is known that auscultation is subjective, i.e., respiratory sound interpretation depends on the stethoscope properties, hearing ability and clinical experience of users and their capacity to memorise sound patterns4. To overcome the associated subjectivity, research efforts have been devoted to develop computerised respiratory sound analysis (CORSA), which consists of recording respiratory sounds with an electronic device and objectively analysing/classifying them based on advanced digital signal processing techniques. Through CORSA, respiratory sounds were found to be a more sensitive indicator, detecting and characterising the severity of respiratory diseases before any other measure5. Since then, special attention has been given to the automatic detection and characterisation of respiratory sounds, such as crackles, as changes in their properties can early inform the presence of several respiratory conditions6. Crackles are acoustically defined as explosive and discontinuous sounds with a duration of less than 20 ms6. The most studied crackleâ€™s parameters are the initial deflection width (IDW), the largest deflection width (LDW) and the two cycle deflection (2CD)6,7 (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Crackle time-domain parameters: initial deflection width (IDW), largest deflection width (LDW), two-cycle duration (2CD), total duration (TD) and maximum peak (peak max.). Despite cracklesâ€™ great value to contribute for the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases, their automatic detection and characterisation is still challenging namely, in respiratory sound files recorded in clinical settings, as these sounds often present associated artefacts (e.g., environmental noise and movement artefacts), which affect the recognition accuracy of algorithms8. Several signal processing techniques have been proposed, including digital filters9, spectrogram analysis10, time-domain analysis10, auto-regressive models11 and wavelet-packet transform methods12, fuzzy filters13 and fractal dimension filtering14. Despite the high values of sensitivity and specificity associated with these techniques, limited testing12,14 have been performed with respiratory sound files recorded in clinical settings and validated against a multi-annotator gold standard15. Taking these factors into consideration, it may be hypothesised that, when tested in such conditions, the proposed signal processing techniques will have lower performances than originally reported. Therefore, a robust algorithm to detect and characterise crackles in respiratory sound files acquired in clinical settings is needed. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for automatic crackleâ€™s detection and characterisation and to evaluate its performance and accuracy against a multi-annotator gold standard. Accordingly, this paper is organised as follows: section 2 describes the methodologies underlying the development and validation of the proposed algorithm; section 3 presents the results of the algorithmâ€™s validation in terms of sensitivity (SE); positive predictive value (PPV) and F- index; section 4 discusses the results and highlights possible improvements; and section 5 concludes the paper and presents future work. 707 CÃ¡tia Pinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 705 â€“ 712 2. Methods Twenty-four respiratory sound files of adult patients with pneumonia acquired in the community (15 sound files from 6 patients; 46Â±14.6yrs) and cystic fibrosis (9 sound files from 4 patients; 32.3Â±18.1yrs) were obtained from 2 academic repositories. Respiratory sounds of patients with pneumonia belong to a repository built at University of Aveiro in the scope of a research project (PTDC/SAUâ€“BEB/101943/2008). Respiratory sounds of patients with cystic fibrosis were collected during a PhD project at University of Southampton (SFRH/BD/21375/2005). All respiratory sounds were acquired following CORSA short-term sound acquisition guidelines16 for 25 seconds with a ThinklabsÂ® digital stethoscope (ThinklabsÂ® Rhythm: ds32a, Colorado, US) in patients with pneumonia and with a WelchAllyn digital stethoscope (WelchAllyn Meditron, 5079-402) in patients with cystic fibrosis. Recordings were performed at a sampling rate (fs) of 44.1 kHz. Ethical approvals and written informed consents were obtained before any data collection. 2.1. Crackles manual annotation Manual annotation of crackles was performed in all respiratory sound files. Firstly, the files duration was reduced to 10-seconds, as manual annotation is a time-consuming process2,17. Then, three respiratory researchers, with experience in visual-auditory crackle recognition, independently annotated the beginning and the end of each crackle in each respiratory sound file. Respiratory Sound Annotation Software V1.1 was used to perform the annotation2. For each respiratory sound, a gold standard annotation was obtained by combining the annotations from the three researchers. An event was flagged as a crackle if at least two researchers had identified it (i.e., agreement by majority)18. The agreement between researchers was set considering the maximum absolute peak within each crackle annotation15 and was assessed by dividing the number of crackles in which the researchers agreed by the total number of crackles annotated. An agreement of 86% was achieved. 2.2. Automatic crackle detection The proposed algorithm can be summarised in three main steps: i) extraction of a window of interest of a potential crackle (based on fractal dimension and box filtering techniques)14,19-21; ii) verification of the validity of the potential crackle considering CORSA established criteria7,22; and iii) characterisation and extraction of crackleâ€™s parameters. The signal was downsampled to 11025Hz (fs) after appropriate anti-aliasing filtering, to reduce computation requirements. The signal filtering consisted in the application of a passband filter of [100 â€“ 2000] Hz (finite impulse response, designed with a 83ms Blackman window), to eliminate high frequency noise, ensuring that the main features of the crackles were still preserved6,23. 2.2.1. Extraction of a window of interest The extraction of a window of interest involved different signal processing steps: i) Savitzky-Golay (polynomial) finite impulse response (FIR) smoothing24; ii) fractal dimension estimation12,14,19; iii) box filtering21,25; and iv) application of a threshold to extract the beginning and the end of a window of interest. A diagram summarising these steps is presented in figure 2. Figure 2. Main steps performed by the algorithm to extract a window of interest of length (LWOI), i.e., identifying a potential crackle. 708 CÃ¡tia Pinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 705 â€“ 712 Firstly, a smoothing in the signal was performed to extract the remaining high frequency peaks of noise. Secondly, the fractal dimension of the signal was estimated using a sliding window of length LFD. Fractal dimension is a statistical measure that indicates an objectâ€™s complexity in fractal geometry and it is used to evaluate the complexity of a waveform. The method proposed by Sevcik (2010)20 was used, as it is more sensitive to waveform changes and faster than other commonly used methods, such as the signals envelop method20. Fractal dimension is defined by: Ü¨Ü¦ àµŒ Í³ àµ… ÂŽÂ� áˆºÜ®áˆ»ÂŽÂ� áˆºÍ´Ü°á‡±áˆ» (1) where N' is the number of steps in the waveform (Ü°á‡± àµŒ Ü®à®¿à®½ àµˆ Ý‚Ý� àµ† Í³) and L represents the total length of the waveform, i.e., the sum of the Euclidean distance between successive data points: Ü® àµŒà·�Ý€Ý…Ý�Ý�áˆºÝ…Ç¡ Ý… àµ… Í³áˆ» à¯‡á‡± à¯œà­€à¬µ (2) Thirdly, an additional smoothing to estimate the trend of the fractal dimension signal in each time instance was applied. The estimation of the trend was based on box filtering, also known as average or mean filtering, with a sliding window of length LBF. This is a commonly used technique to reduce noise, accomplished by replacing each amplitude value with the average value of the surrounding neighbours, including itself. Therefore, the large amplitude variations between samples was removed and a much smoother signal was produced (i.e., the trend). This will enhance the identification of crackles in noisy signals, such as sounds acquired in a clinical settings or sounds containing other adventitious respiratory sounds, e.g., wheezes. In the fourth step, the fractal dimension signal was compared to an adaptive threshold to identify the window of interest of a potential crackle by Ü¨Ü¦ àµ� Üº àµˆ Ý�ÝŽÝ�ÝŠÝ€, where Üº is a free parameter for optimisation (Fig. 3). The final length of the window of interest was defined as the variable LWOI. Figure 3. Adaptive threshold applied to the fractal dimension (FD) signal to identify the window of interest of a potential crackle by Ü¨Ü¦ àµ� Üº àµˆ Ý�ÝŽÝ�ÝŠÝ€, where Üº àµŒ Í³Ç¡ Í´Ç¡ Íµ. 2.2.2. Verification of crackle A function was developed to evaluate the validity of the potential crackle by verifying if the window of interest met CORSA established criteria for crackles10. Also, additional considerations empirically established by the analysis of noisy signals were implemented to correct errors in the detection. Therefore, the following set of conditions were established: i) the amplitude of the different peaks of the crackles had to be progressively lower than the LDW; ii) peaks had to be progressively wider after the IDW (variable defined as Wpeaks); iii) crackle zero-crossings were verified: minimum of 5 zero-crossings, to guarantee the calculation of 2CD, and maximum of 16 zero-crossings; iv) the mean absolute amplitude of the crackle had to be higher than F times the mean absolute amplitude of the background noise estimated from a segment of length Lbckg preceding the crackle (considering the CORSA criteria, that suggests that crackle amplitude had to be higher than 2*background noise) 709 CÃ¡tia Pinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 705 â€“ 712 v) crackleâ€™s IDW had to be higher than 1/8 of the LDW. 2.2.3. Optimization of algorithm parameters Seven threshold parameters were established to improve the performance of the automatic crackleâ€™s detection algorithm. Three different values were tested for each parameter, resulting in a total of 2187 (37) combinations. The best combination was defined as the one presenting the highest F-index similarity with the gold standard annotation. The threshold parameters and corresponding values evaluated were: 1) width of the fractal window of approximately half the length of the crackle12 (Ü®à®¿à®½ àµŒ Í¶Ç¡ Í¸Ç¡ Íº Ý‰Ý�); 2) width of the box filtering window (Ü®à®»à®¿ àµŒ Í¶Í²Ç¡ Í¸Í²Ç¡ ÍºÍ² Ý‰Ý�); 3) parameter Üº (àµŒ Í³Ç¡ Í´Ç¡ Íµ) applied in the adaptive threshold to identify the window of interest; 4) minimal length of the window of interest of each crackle (Ü®à¯�à¯ˆà¯‚ àµŒ Í²Ç¤Í·Ç¡ Í³Ç¡ Í´ Ý‰Ý�); 5) error factor range (àµŒ Í³È€Í·Ç¡ Í³È€Í¶Ç¡ Í³È€Íµ), associated with the width of the peaks following IDW ( à¯£Ü¹à¯˜à¯”à¯žà¯¦ àµ‡ Ý�ÝŽÝŽÝ‹ÝŽ Ý‚Ü½Ü¿Ý�Ý‹ÝŽ àµˆ à¯£Ü¹à¯˜à¯”à¯žà¯¦); 6) length of the background sound before the crackle (Ü®à¯•à¯–à¯žà¯š àµŒ Í´Í²Ç¡ Í¶Í²Ç¡ Ü½ÝˆÝˆ×› Ý‰Ý�) *considering all background length before the crackle; 7) factor multiplied by the amplitude of the background sound (Ü¨ àµŒ Í³Ç¤Í¸Ç¡ Í³Ç¤ÍºÇ¡ Í´). Parameters 6 and 7 were established to evaluate the amplitude of the crackle when compared with the background noise (condition â€˜ivâ€™ defined in the section 2.3.2). Only the background length before the crackle window was evaluated. This strategy allowed the extraction of previous crackles detected in that signal, ensuring that only background sound was considered. Figure 4 provides a flow diagram of the proposed algorithm to detect crackles. Figure 4. Flow diagram of the proposed algorithm to detect crackles. 2.3. Classification measures to validate the algorithm The validation of the performance and accuracy of the automatic crackleâ€™s detection algorithm was obtained by comparing the results against the multi-annotator gold standard (see section 2.2). Classifier performance26 is typically based on four well-known parameters, namely true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) counts. These parameters are the basis of many common classification metrics, for example sensitivity (SE) and positive predictive value (PPV), both usually expressed as percentages. These metrics imply a comparison between the automatic detection results and a gold standard, which for respiratory sounds is the judgment of respiratory experts15. Thus, the algorithm performance was assessed by comparing the maximum absolute peak within each identified crackle with the results of the multi-annotator gold standard. Then, SE, PPV and the algorithmâ€™s F-index were calculated. 710 CÃ¡tia Pinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 705 â€“ 712 SE is defined as the ratio between crackles correctly detected (TP) and the sum of TP with the number of crackles not detected by the algorithm (FN). ÜµÜ§ àµŒ Ü¶Ü²Ü¶Ü² àµ… Ü¨Ü° (3) PPV is the ratio between TP and the total number of crackles detected by the algorithm, i.e., correctly (TP) and incorrectly detected (FP). Ü²Ü²Ü¸ àµŒ Ü¶Ü²Ü¶Ü² àµ… Ü¨Ü² (4) The total performance (F index) is an additional and more robust measure of an algorithmâ€™s performance and is given by the combination of both SE and PPV values21.

Results The performance of the automatic crackleâ€™s detection algorithm was optimised with the following set of parameters:Ü®à®¿à®½ àµŒ Í¸ Ý‰Ý�; Ü®à®»à®¿ àµŒ Í¸Í² Ý‰Ý�; Üº àµŒ Íµ; Ü®à¯�à¯ˆà¯‚ àµŒ Í´Ý‰Ý�; Ý�ÝŽÝŽÝ‹ÝŽ Ý‚Ü½Ü¿Ý�Ý‹ÝŽ àµŒ Í³È€Í¶; Ü®à¯•à¯–à¯žà¯š àµŒ Í´Í² Ý‰Ý�; and Ü¨ àµŒ Í´. Using this algorithm, the number of crackles identified (range: 1-108) was similar to the obtained by the multi-annotator gold standard (range: 2-129). Results per respiratory sound file are shown in figure 5. Figure 5. Crackles detected by manual annotation (gold standard) and by the proposed algorithm for each respiratory sound file. Figure 6 presents the SE, PPV and F index of the algorithm for each respiratory sound file. Files 18 and 22 (from patients with pneumonia) were those in which the algorithm presented the lowest performance (F index of 57 and 67%). Considering the 24 respiratory sound files, the average of SE, PPV and F index of the proposed algorithm were 89Â±10%, 95Â±11% and 92Â±10%, respectively. Figure 6. Sensitivity (SE), positive predictive value (PPV) and F index of the proposed algorithm for each respiratory sound. 711 CÃ¡tia Pinho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 705 â€“ 712 4. Discussion A set of seven parameters were used to optimise the proposed algorithm in a sample of 24 sound files. The results demonstrated that this was an efficient and robust method for crackleâ€™s detection/classification and highlights its potential to be used in respiratory sound files acquired in clinical settings. The conditions initially implemented in the algorithm strictly followed the ones proposed by the CORSA criteria. However, during the iterative assessment of the algorithm, a sharp divergence between the results obtained with the algorithm and those from the gold standard was verified. Thus, some refinements of the standard rules were implemented, e.g., in the criteria stating that the width of the peaks should be progressively wider after IDW, a deviation of 25% was allowed. It should be noted, that despite the high subjectivity associated with human detection of crackles, this is still considered the only valid method for its detection4, as health professionals are the ones who use it routinely to establish diagnosis and monitoring patients. Therefore, algorithms should be developed to match the gold standard annotation and not the opposite. The SE (89%), PPV (95%) and F index (92%) of the proposed algorithm are comparable or even higher than those of other methods (SE 80â€’91%; PPV 83 88%; F index 86.7%)15,24. However, it should be noted that, contrarily to other algorithms, the presented one was tested with respiratory sound files clinically recorded, which further increase its potential to be used by health professionals during their clinical practice. Only in two respiratory sound files from patients with pneumonia, the performance of the algorithm did not reach these high standard values (F index of 57% and 67%). Such findings are related with the low number of crackles presented (TP) in these two respiratory sound files (1 9 crackles in the sound file), causing the few FP and FN to have a negative impact in the F-index. Nevertheless, this error might not have relevance for clinical practice as it has been reported that healthy people present approximately 4 crackles per breathing cycle27. Hence errors of this magnitude might not be clinically significant for diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases. This study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. The proposed algorithm was developed by comparing the results against a multi-annotator gold standard obtained from the annotations of three respiratory researchers. Despite the high agreement achieved (86%), it is well-known that human annotation is associated with high levels of subjectivity, thus future studies should consider creating a repository of respiratory sounds annotated by an additional number of experts to minimise bias. Also, a small sample of respiratory sounds files was included from adult patients with pneumonia and cystic fibrosis. Therefore, it would be of great asset to validate the proposed algorithm in large sets of data from patients with other respiratory diseases and different age ranges (young children and infants). Finally, although the proposed algorithm is currently processing in real-time, making it suitable to be used in the clinical practice, it would also benefit from being included in Clinical Decision Support System, e.g., by allowing patterns comparison of samples and providing info/pre-diagnosis to the caregiver28, not yet addressed in the current version of the algorithm. 5. Conclusion and Future Work The proposed algorithm achieved a high performance (F index 92%). This promising result highlights the potential of this new approach for automatic crackleâ€™s detection and classification in respiratory sounds acquired in clinical settings. Future research should focus in developing a portable technology including a sound acquisition device plus an open source software integrating the developed algorithm. This would allow health professionals to have instant feedback on their lung sounds recordings. Additionally, international collaborations are being established to acquire a large database of normal and adventitious respiratory sounds (including crackles, wheezes, rhonchi, stridor, etc) that could be used to find unsuspected relationships, summarise respiratory data into patterns and thus be used in Clinical Decision Support System.

Crackles automatic detection in a respiratory sound file is challenging, and thus different signal processing methodologies have been proposed. However, limited testing of such methodologies, namely in respiratory sound files collected in clinical settings, has been conducted. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for automatic crackle detection and characterisation and to evaluate its performance and accuracy against a multi-annotator gold standard. The algorithm is based on three main procedures: i) extraction of a window of interest of a potential crackle (based on fractal dimension and box filtering techniques); ii) verification of the validity of the potential crackle considering computerised respiratory sound analysis established criteria; and iii) characterisation and extraction of crackle parameters. Twenty four 10-second files, acquired in clinical settings, were selected from 10 patients with pneumonia and cystic fibrosis. The algorithm performance was assessed by comparing its results with gold standard annotations (obtained by the agreement among three experts). A set of 7 parameters was optimised. High levels of sensitivity (SE=89%), positive predictive value (PPV=95%) and overall performance (F index=92%) were achieved. This promising result highlights the potential of the algorithm for automatic crackle's detection/characterisation in respiratory sounds acquired in clinical settings.

We apply the developed methods to the human genome and we conclude that a strong similarity exists between the distance distributions of symmetric oligonucleotides. We also conclude that exceptional distance symmetry is present in several equivalent composition groups, that is, there is a strong lack of homogeneity in the group and a strong homogeneity in the included symmetric word pairs. This suggests a stronger parity rule than Chargaff's: in the human genome, symmetric oligonucleotides have equivalent occurrence frequency and, additionally, they present similar distance distributions.",

Methods The Scopus (1995–2013), Web of Science (1970–2013), PubMed (1948-2013) and B-on (1999–2013) databases were searched. Articles were included when sEMG was used to assess MCo during gait in people with impairment due to central nervous system disorders (CNS). Results Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria and most studied people with cerebral palsy and stroke. No consensus was identified for gait assessment protocols (surfaces, speed, distance), sEMG acquisition (electrodes position), analysis of sEMG data (filters, normalisation techniques) and quantification of MCo (agonist-antagonist linear envelopes overlapping or agonist-antagonist overlapping periods of muscles activity, onset delimited). Conclusion Given the wide range of methodologies employed, it is not possible to recommend the most appropriate for assessing MCo. Researchers should adopt recognized standards in future work. This is needed before consensus about the role that MCo plays in gait impairment in neurological diseases and its potential as a target for gait rehabilitation can be determined. Keywords Co-contraction Co-activation Gait Walking Neurological diseases 1 Introduction Gait patterns are usually impaired in people with dysfunction of the Central Nervous System (CNS), such as stroke (Knutsson and Richards, 1979), traumatic brain injury (Chow et al., 2012), cerebral palsy (Hesse et al., 2000) or Parkinson’s disease (Dietz et al., 1981). Walking is a very complex function involving multiple interactions between muscle groups which can be adapted to enable walking at different speeds or on different surfaces (Winter, 2009). Neurological impairments can generate many deviations in muscle activity and gait kinematics from those seen in healthy individuals and reduce the ability to adapt gait appropriately to different environmental conditions. Gait patterns in people with neurological impairment have been characterized by abnormal muscle co-contraction, especially when postural stability is challenged (Lamontagne et al., 2000). Muscle Co-contraction (MCo) is the mechanism that regulates simultaneous activity of agonist and antagonist muscles crossing the same joint (Busse et al. 2005). There is no consensus about the role that MCo plays in the various stages of recovery after CNS disease. However as MCo has been demonstrated to be important for providing adequate joint stability, movement accuracy and energy efficiency (Higginson et al. 2006) and adapting to environmental demands (Darainy and Ostry, 2008), its importance in neurological recovery is worthy of consideration. Accurate determination of the impact of neurological impairment on MCo during gait requires robust measurement techniques which take careful consideration of the environmental conditions under which gait is assessed (Den Otter et al. 2004). For instance, walking on a ground surface instead of on a treadmill, walking at different speeds and for longer distances/duration would increase MCo recruitment and the variability between subjects (Parvataneni et al. 2009; Knarr et al. 2012). The first research question addressed by this review therefore is: What are the main characteristics of the gait assessment protocols particularly, the surfaces where people walked, the speed, distance and time spent walking? Which muscles have been assessed? All measurement techniques, including sEMG, are liable to measurement error which can reduce validity and reliability and confound interpretation of the findings. MCo assessment during functional movements, such as walking, requires the analysis of the relative variations in agonist and antagonist contraction over time using surface electromyography (sEMG) equipment (Fonseca et al. 2001; Fonseca et al. 2004). Standards have been developed for reporting sEMG signals in different processing stages, such as the signal acquisition (Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment Muscles (SENIAM) guidelines), and analogue and digital analysis (International Society of Electrophysiology and Kinesiology (ISEK) guidelines) (Merletti 1999), but the implementation of these is variable. Despite these guidelines, controversies remain about the most appropriate techniques of sEMG signal analysis; (e.g., selection of normalisation technique) leading to inconsistencies across studies (Burden et al., 2003). Therefore, the second research question this review sought to answer is: What are the main steps in the acquisition and analysis of the sEMG signals and which parameters have been considered when quantifying MCo? A single definition of MCo would also be facilitate interpretation of MCo outcomes during walking. However MCo has been defined in different ways: the magnitude; the time; or a ratio between the magnitude and time of simultaneous activation of opposite muscles (Fonseca et al. 2001). As a result of different definitions, different formulas or computational approaches to quantify MCo have been employed (Fonseca et al. 2001). All these methodological differences limit the comparison of data across studies and the understanding of the mechanisms of MCo. The third research question for this review is therefore: Which formulas or computational approaches have been used to quantify MCo? This paper addresses the need to systematically review, synthesize and critique the methodologies used in this field, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning MCo and of its role in gait in people with CNS disease. 2 Methods 2.1 Variable of interest The variable of interest in this study was MCo during gait, presented as the time and/or the magnitude of simultaneous contraction between opposite muscles (Fonseca et al. 2001). 2.2 Search strategy The literature search was performed from date of inception until end of November 2012 on the following databases: Scopus (1995–2013), Web of Science (1970–2013), PubMed (1948–2013) and B-on (1999–2013). B-on includes the Academic Search Complete (EBSCO), Annual Reviews, Elsevier-Science Direct, Nature, Springer Link (Springer/Kluwer), Taylor &Francis and Wiley Online Library (Wiley). Weekly updates were performed until October 2013. The following search term (free text words) combinations were used in PubMed database: co-contraction AND gait, co-contraction AND locomotion, co-contraction AND Walking; co-activation AND gait; co-activation AND locomotion, co-activation AND walking. Search strategies in the other databases were derived from PubMed. The search terms were limited to titles and abstracts. The reference lists of all studies were also scanned to identify other potentially eligible articles. The study was conducted using the systematic review method proposed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Moher et al. 2009), as shown in Fig. 1 . Full papers, written in English or Portuguese that met the following criteria were included if they: (i) studied gait impairment due to neurological diseases, such as stroke, Parkinsońs disease, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury and other CNS dysfunctions; and ii) analysed MCo during gait of the lower or upper limb or trunk using sEMG. All articles were independently reviewed by two reviewers for relevance and quality using PRISMA (Moher et al. 2009). Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. 3 Results Fig. 1 portrays the number of articles identified, the numbers and reasons for exclusion and the total number of studies included in the final review A descriptive analysis of the methodologies (study design; sample; data collection protocol; sEMG data acquisition and analysis and quantification of MCo) of the included studies is presented in Table 1 . 3.1 Study design and sample Most studies included in this review had observational designs, with the exception of two experimental studies (Hesse et al. 2000; Massaad et al. 2010). The observational studies assessed MCo during gait with no intervention or program. From those studies, only one was longitudinal (Den Otter et al. 2006), with data collection over five time points. The experimental study used non-randomized control groups and assessed gait before and after an intervention (Concato 2004). With the exception of six articles (Hesse et al. 1999; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Keefer et al. 2004; Massaad et al. 2010) all others included a group of healthy participants to provide normative comparison of MCo. MCo during gait was studied in several neurological conditions including stroke (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Hesse et al. 1999; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010; Chow et al. 2012), cerebral palsy (Leonard et al. 1991; Unnithan et al. 1996; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Keefer et al. 2004; Wakeling et al. 2007; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011), multiple sclerosis and cerebral tumor (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981), Parkinson’s disease (Dietz et al. 1981; Arias et al. 2012), traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Chow et al. 2012) and finally, myelopathy, sclerosis, amyotrophy and meningitis (Dietz et al. 1981). Sample sizes varied from 5 (Leonard et al. 1991) to 30 participants (Lamontagne et al. 2000). In some studies, age (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Prosser et al. 2010) and gender (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Prosser et al. 2010) criteria were not well-matched between the group of people with CNS disorders and the healthy controls. Anthropometric data, including height and weight, were described in seven studies (Unnithan et al. 1996; Damiano et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011). The others described either weight (Hesse et al. 2000) or height (Massaad et al. 2010; Arias et al. 2012). 3.2 Research Question 1: What are the main characteristics of the gait assessment protocols particularly, the surfaces where people walked, the speed, distance and time spent walking? Which muscles were assessed? Different surfaces were used to assess gait in the included studies. In some studies, a walkway (usually a corridor on the floor) was used (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Keefer et al. 2004; Wakeling et al. 2007; Assumpção et al. 2011; Arias et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2012), whereas in others participants walked on a treadmill (Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Unnithan et al. 1996; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010; Prosser et al. 2010). Gait performance on a treadmill was compared to gait performance on the ground in one study (Hesse et al. 1999). A wide variety of instructions were given to participants regarding the speed they should walk. A number of studies used a free/normal/self-selected speed (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Hesse et al. 1999; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Den Otter et al. 2007; Wakeling et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012). In three studies subjects were instructed to walk as quickly as possible (Unnithan et al. 1996; Hesse et al. 1999; Den Otter et al. 2006) but only in two of these studies, average gait speeds were reported: 0.27m per second (Hesse et al. 1999); an average of 3km per hour achieved when asking patients to walk at 90% of maximum speed during 2min (Unnithan et al. 1996). Keefer et al. (2004) asked patients to perform three 5-min walking trials at 0.67, 0.89 and 1.12m per second, controlled by a treadmill setting. One study (Arias et al. 2012) assessed walking in three different conditions: subjects were first instructed to walk at their preferred speed, then at fast speed and finally, to match their steps with a pulsing rhythm provided by a metronome (Arias et al. 2012). Moreover, in most studies (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Hesse et al. 1999; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Wakeling et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011; Arias et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2012) impaired and healthy participants were given the same instructions but in 3 other studies (Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Chow et al. 2012) the healthy participants were asked to walk “very slowly” in an attempt to control for the effect of gait speed on MCo patterns. The walking distance or the time spent walking also varied: four studies (Lamontagne et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2001; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003) asked participants to walk 10m and Knutsson and Richards (1979) and Chow et al. (2012) used 5m. Distances longer than 10m were also used by Hesse et al. (1999), Damiano et al. (2000) and Arias et al. (2012); whilst the time spent walking was the criterion used to define the protocol in the other studies, ranging from 40 s (at a maximum speed) (Keefer et al. 2004) to 30min (at a comfortable speed) (Massaad et al. 2010). MCo was acquired from different muscles during gait performance. Four studies assessed thigh muscles (Damiano et al. 2000; Keefer et al. 2004; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011), five studies assessed only shank muscles (Dietz et al. 1981; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Arias et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2012) whilst the others assessed muscles of the entire lower limb. Only one study assessed MCo from trunk muscles and (Prosser et al. 2010) there were no articles assessing MCo of the upper limb or any other body structures during gait. 3.3 Research Question 2: What were the main steps in the acquisition and analysis of the sEMG signals and which parameters were considered when quantifying MCo? Data acquisition was inconsistent across studies. Only five studies followed the SENIAM recommendations for both electrode placement and skin preparation (Detrembleur et al. 2003; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011). Six studies did not describe electrode position (Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Wakeling et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010); only one of these described how the skin was prepared (Damiano et al. 2000). The analogue and digital processing of the sEMG signal was performed differently across studies. Analogue processing usually involves two main steps: pre-amplification and application of filters. However, two older studies (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981) included in this review, used analogue techniques to construct the linear envelope (LE) of the signal. Several amplifiers were employed, with different values of common mode rejection ratio and input impedance, assuming values from 50dB (Chow et al. 2012) to 110dB (Assumpção et al. 2011) and values from 10KΩ (Unnithan et al. 1996; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002) to 31MΩ (Chow et al. 2012) respectively. Analogue filter characteristics were also different, assuming high-pass cut-off values of 10Hz (Unnithan et al. 1996), 20Hz (Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Keefer et al. 2004; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Prosser et al. 2010; Arias et al. 2012)or 50Hz (Leonard et al. 1991) and low-pass cut-off frequencies of 450Hz (Prosser et al. 2010; Arias et al. 2012), 500Hz (Unnithan et al. 1996; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007), 800Hz (Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002), 1000Hz (Leonard et al. 1991) or 4000Hz (Keefer et al. 2004). Digital filters employed in studies also had different low and high cut-off frequencies. Low cut-off frequencies ranged from 300Hz (Hesse et al. 1999; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Massaad et al. 2010) to 500Hz (Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012) and high cut-off frequencies ranged from 10Hz (Hesse et al. 1999; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012) and 25Hz (Detrembleur et al. 2003; Massaad et al. 2010). A LE was digitally constructed in the majority of studies, however a wide range of smoothing parameters (low-pass filters) were used: 3Hz (Unnithan et al. 1996; Keefer et al. 2004), 6Hz (Assumpção et al. 2011), 10Hz (Chow et al. 2012), 20Hz (Damiano et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002) and 25Hz (Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007). Normalization is a procedure of referencing EMG data to a standard value, allowing data comparison between muscles, across time and between subjects (Soderberg and Knutson, 2000; Burden et al. 2003). EMG signals can be normalized using temporal and amplitude parameters. Different temporal parameters were used in the included studies: each 5% of gait cycle duration (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981); 100% of step cycle duration (Leonard et al. 1991); mean cycle duration and 100% of gait cycle duration (Damiano et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Keefer et al. 2004; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007). Amplitude parameters were also different across the studies: mean amplitude (Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012) or peak value (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Unnithan et al. 1996; Arias et al. 2012) in each gait cycle; mean amplitude of a total of three gait cycles (Keefer et al. 2004); and, mean value or largest value of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Unnithan et al. 1996). Lamontagne et al. (2000, 2002) questioned the value of normalizing data, claiming that selection of a single maximum value could be affected by electrical noise and that the muscle activity recorded during maximal voluntary strength could be very different in healthy subjects and those with stroke. Therefore, these authors did not apply any amplitude normalization, quantifying MCo using absolute sEMG values. Several intensity and timing parameters were considered in the analysis of sEMG during gait. The following intensity parameters were used to analyse the sEMG signal: the peak amplitude in each gait cycle (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002), the area of the envelope (Unnithan et al. 1996; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Keefer et al. 2004; Assumpção et al. 2011; Arias et al. 2012; Chow et al. 2012) or a mean value of it (Damiano et al. 2000). Duration of muscle activity depends on accurate determination of the onset and offset of muscle contraction. Muscle contraction onset is a parameter used to mark the beginning of muscle activity and it was determined by using various computerized methods (Unnithan et al. 1996; Hesse et al. 2000; Prosser et al. 2010; Chow et al. 2012) or by visual inspection of the sEMG signal (Detrembleur et al. 2003). Within the computerized methods, Unnithan et al. (1996) determined onset when sEMG assume values between 5% and 10% above the maximum voluntary contraction value; Hesse et al. (2000) identified onset as any significant burst which achieved at least 10% of a maximum sEMG recorded and lasted at least 5% of a cycle duration; Prosser et al. (2010) determined onset periods using a Teager-Kaiser energy operator, an automatic filtering and de-noising approach; Chow et al. (2012) determined onset when the sEMG signal exceeded three standard deviations of the mean. Visual inspection, to define muscle onsets, was performed in one study by two independent raters observing graphs of previously averaged and normalized sEMG data, (Hesse et al. 1999). A consensus of opinion between both raters determined the definition of muscle temporal patterns. No information was provided about the determination of offsets in any of the included papers. 3.4 Research Question 3: Which formulas or computational approaches have been used to quantify MCo? MCo was quantified using different formulas or computational approaches. Two different approaches were used to quantify the temporal MCo: i) the time of overlap between LE of two opposite muscles (Unnithan et al. 1996; Damiano et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012) and ii) the time of overlap between activity periods (onset delimited) of opposite muscles (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Hesse et al. 1999; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Den Otter et al. 2006; Massaad et al. 2010; Prosser et al. 2010). To quantify the magnitude of MCo, Hesse et al. (2000), Keefer et al. (2004) and Arias et al. (2012) divided the common area of the LE of antagonist muscles by the sum of the areas of those muscles. Unnithan et al. (1996) divided the common area of LE between two muscles by the number of data points and Assumpção et al. (2011) and Damiano et al. (2000) calculated the difference between the minimum and maximum values of opposite muscles in each point of the gait cycle. The amount of MCo was also measured using (i) the mean value of the area of overlap (Damiano et al. 2000), (ii) a correlation between the spectra of two opposite muscles (Wakeling et al. 2007), (iii) a quantification of the area of overlap between opposite muscles (Assumpção et al. 2011) or (iv) dividing this area by the overlap duration (Chow et al. 2012). 4 Discussion This systematic review explored the methodologies used to assess MCo during gait in people with CNS disorders, that in most cases were stroke and cerebral palsy (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Hesse et al. 1999; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Keefer et al. 2004; Den Otter et al. 2006; Den Otter et al. 2007; Wakeling et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012). Given the considerable variability in the methods used to assess gait, analyse sEMG and quantify MCo, no recommendations can be made at this time about the most appropriate methodologies to assess MCo during gait in people with CNS disorders. Several differences were found in the gait protocols of the included studies, including the walking speed, ground surface and duration or the distance that people walked. Walking speed is known to influence muscle activity in both healthy people and those with impairment (Hesse et al. 2001). In the majority of studies, participants were instructed to walk at their self-selected speed (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al. 1981; Leonard et al. 1991; Hesse et al. 1999; Damiano et al. 2000; Hesse et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Detrembleur et al. 2003; Wakeling et al. 2007; Massaad et al. 2010; Prosser et al. 2010; Assumpção et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2012). However, as the self-selected speed of healthy subjects is obviously different from those with CNS disorders, some authors (Lamontagne et al. 2000; Lamontagne et al. 2002; Chow et al. 2012) tried to control for the influence of speed on gait pattern and match data capture conditions by instructing controls to walk at a very slow speed. However, subjects are walking under unusual circumstances which may increase postural instability (Den Otter et al. 2004) and may cause different muscle activity bursts (Lingling et al. 2010). This may not therefore be the most appropriate methodology for defining speed during gait. Self-selected gait speed for both healthy people and people with CNS disorders might be the most accurate methodology for comparing sEMG data. Ground surface is also known to influence muscle activity. In subjects with stroke, there is a tendency to increase cadence and to induce muscle activity modifications (e.g., earlier muscle contraction onset) during treadmill walking, compared with walking on the ground (Harris-Love et al., 2004). This makes comparison between the results obtained in ground walking (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al., 1981; Damiano et al., 2000; Hesse et al., 2000; Lamontagne et al., 2000; Lamontagne et al., 2002; Detrembleur et al., 2003; Keefer et al., 2004; Wakeling et al., 2007; Assumpção et al., 2011; Chow et al., 2012) and treadmill walking very difficult (Dietz et al., 1981; Leonard et al., 1991; Unnithan et al., 1996; Den Otter et al., 2006; Massaad et al., 2010; Prosser et al., 2010). There are, however, practical reasons why the different surfaces may have been selected for use with people with CNS disorders. Treadmill walking offers a more restricted space, protective bars and better monitoring conditions to enhance safety in people with poor balance (Laufer et al., 2001). However, studies using ground walking are more reflective of everyday life and may be easier and cheaper to conduct. A validation study exploring what incline grade a treadmill should be at to more closely replicate walking on a ground surface (Laufer et al., 2001; Mason et al., 2013) would be a useful future step. Subjects with CNS disorders tend to increase their MCo magnitude to be able to walk longer or further, resulting in inefficient MCo strategies and abnormal walking patterns and potentially contributing to fatigue and muscle pain (Dean et al., 2001; Brunner and Romkes, 2008). Recommendations to the most appropriate walking distance or time for use in sEMG studies are therefore needed. Despite publication of the SENIAM guidelines for sensor placement procedures in 1996 (Hermens et al., 2000) and of ISEK guidelines for reporting sEMG data acquisition (Merletti, 1999) and signal analysis in 1999, many studies in this review did not adhere to the recommendations nor offer justification for their lack of adherence. The fulfillment of these guidelines is determinant for the analysis of MCo, as it affects the characteristics of the sEMG signal recorded from opposite muscles (Fonseca et al., 2001). In terms of sensor placement, the first study from this review to follow these guidelines was from 2003 (Detrembleur et al., 2003) but a further five later studies (Keefer et al., 2004; Wakeling et al., 2007; Massaad et al., 2010; Arias et al., 2012; Chow et al., 2012) did not follow the SENIAM acquisition recommendations. In terms of signal processing analysis, the use of bandwidth amplifier filters within the range of 5–500Hz and the use of low pass filters at 5 or 6Hz to smooth the full-wave rectified signal, constructing a LE (Merletti, 1999) were important ISEK recommendations. However, most studies in this review used amplifier filters with characteristics different from those recommended (Merletti, 1999), high-pass cut-offs at 20Hz (Lamontagne et al., 2000; Lamontagne et al., 2002; Keefer et al., 2004; Den Otter et al., 2006; Den Otter et al., 2007; Prosser et al., 2010) and low-pass cut-offs varied from 4000Hz (Keefer et al., 2004) to 450Hz (Prosser et al., 2010) Only Assumpção et al. (2011) used a 6Hz low-pass filter to construct a LE, following the recommendations (Merletti, 1999). Differences in sEMG data acquisition and analysis of the included studies hinder the comparison of results across studies, therefore future research should strictly adhere to the SENIAM and ISEK recommendations or be able to offer a scientific justification for non-adherence. There are no guidelines for the most adequate procedures for normalizing sEMG signal during gait (Burden et al., 2003). Temporal normalization was the most commonly used procedure in the included studies (Dietz et al., 1981; Hesse et al., 2000; Lamontagne et al., 2000; Detrembleur et al., 2003; Massaad et al., 2010; Assumpção et al., 2011). Temporal normalization involves defining a reference time period (e.g., each 5% of gait cycle) to enable comparison between individuals, across muscles or between trials. The use of temporal normalization alone, in the absence of any other method of normalization, has been criticized because it ignores the relative amplitude of the signal, potentially resulting in signals of inappropriate amplitudes being considered as normal (Bogey et al., 1992). Determining the most appropriate method for normalizing sEMG amplitude is controversial. The aim of this procedure is to express the activity between muscles, across time and between individuals in relation to a reference value obtained during standard and reproducible conditions (Burden and Bartlett, 1999). Three studies recorded reference values during maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) (Dietz et al., 1981; Unnithan et al., 1996; Damiano et al., 2000); however, in patients with neurological conditions, this may not represent the maximum activation capacity of the muscle, resulting in increased inter-subject variation (Burden and Bartlett, 1999). The mean ensemble value (mean value reached within a period) was used in three other studies (Keefer et al., 2004; Assumpção et al., 2011; Chow et al., 2012). Mean ensemble value and peak ensemble value (maximum value reached within a period), have both been considered feasible methods for normalizing data from neurological patients (Yang and Winter, 1984). These methods consist of dividing each sEMG data point by the mean or the peak value recorded from the same sEMG portion of data (Burden et al., 2003). These are more reliable methods as they have the capacity to reduce inter-subject variability (Yang and Winter, 1984). The area of overlap between the LE of opposite muscles was used in eight studies (Damiano et al., 2000; Hesse et al., 2000; Lamontagne et al., 2000; Lamontagne et al., 2002; Keefer et al., 2004; Assumpção et al., 2011; Arias et al., 2012; Chow et al., 2012) to achieve a value of time or intensity of MCo during gait. The mean value of overlap could also be an important parameter for quantifying MCo (Damiano et al., 2000). An index based on the area of overlap between the LE of two opposing muscles in a specific time window was used in two studies (Unnithan et al., 1996; Chow et al., 2012). A LE is a linear distribution of amplitudes at each gait cycle interval proposed (Shiavi et al., 1998) as a good method for studying synergy patterns during gait. However, various factors in the EMG measurement process might influence the establishment of representative LÉs profiles, such as electrode location, thickness of subcutaneous tissues or the system used to detect the signal (Farina et al., 2004) and therefore using amplitude parameters for comparative purposes has been criticised (Farina et al., 2004). LE repeatability can be improved by precision in electrode placement and skin preparation and by following recommendations for sEMG signal analysis (Arsenault et al., 1986; Shiavi et al., 1998): between six and ten strides, depending on the variability of each muscle assessed and an envelope filter with a cut-off frequency 8.9Hz are recommended. However some authors (Morey-Klapsing et al., 2004; Raez et al., 2006) remain critical of the use of amplitude parameters for inter-subject comparison. An alternative method used to quantify MCo in the studies in this review, was the estimation of time during which opposing muscles are active (Knutsson and Richards, 1979; Dietz et al., 1981; Shiavi et al., 1998; Detrembleur et al., 2003; Den Otter et al., 2006; Massaad et al., 2010; Prosser et al., 2010). This method depends on the accuracy of the process used to detect muscle contraction onset (Kerem et al., 2010). At least three different processes have been used: visual inspection, threshold computation and automated algorithms (Kerem et al., 2010). Variability within the automatic methods has also been found as both simple (intensity) (Unnithan et al., 1996; Chow et al., 2012) and double (time and intensity) (Hesse et al., 2000) threshold methods have been used. Double-threshold methods have some potential to eliminate false positives or delayed onset detection, however the establishment of thresholds were inconsistent across studies (Staude et al., 2001). This variability hinders the comparison of temporal MCo patterns and therefore a consensus on temporal automatic methods is needed, improving the sensitivity of the thresholds to the signal parameters. The variability found in the methods used to estimate MCo and the lack of reliability of sEMG intensity parameters makes it difficult to compare MCo patterns between studies. Further research should therefore follow guidelines for sEMG data acquisition and analysis and reach a consensus on the temporal MCo estimation. 5 Limitations This review was limited to studies investigating gait in people with neurological impairment in order to minimize methodological variability which would occur due to the specific requirements of different populations (Burden et al., 2003). However, further reviews on MCo during gait in other disorders such as osteoarticular (Heiden et al., 2009), ligament (Chmielewski et al., 2005) or developmental disorders (Gontijo et al., 2008) are still required. Such reviews may facilitate the generation of methodological consensus across a range of conditions. In addition, only articles written in Portuguese and English were included in this systematic review narrowing the number of eligible articles. 6 Conclusion A systematic review was undertaken to review the literature concerning the methodologies used for measuring MCo during gait in people with neurological impairment due to CNS disorders. It was not possible to make recommendations about the most appropriate methodologies for assessing MCo during gait in people with CNS disorders because of the considerable range of gait protocols and methods for the acquisition, analysis of sEMG and quantification of MCo. The area of overlap between the LE of opposite muscles and also the estimation of onset-delimited temporal MCo offer potential as methods for quantifying MCo. However, for improving repeatability of MCo outcomes methodological criteria for sEMG data collection must be fulfilled and the automatic methods for determining double-thresholds validated. Given that MCo is being considered as a potential parameter to target in gait rehabilitation (Den Otter et al., 2006) more robust standardized methods of evaluation and a rigorous adherence to SENIAM and ISEK guidelines are required.

Therefore, a direct necessity of specific simulation tools for testing and benchmarking is rising, such as a flexible and portable FASTQ read simulator, without the need of a reference sequence, yet correctly prepared for producing approximately the same characteristics as real data. Findings: We present XS, a skilled FASTQ read simulation tool, flexible, portable (does not need a reference sequence) and tunable in terms of sequence complexity. It has several running modes, depending on the time and memory available, and is aimed at testing computing infrastructures, namely cloud computing of large-scale projects, and testing FASTQ compression algorithms. Moreover, XS offers the possibility of simulating the three main FASTQ components individually (headers, DNA sequences and quality-scores). Conclusions: XS provides an efficient and convenient method for fast simulation of FASTQ files, such as those from Ion Torrent (currently uncovered by other simulators), Roche-454, Illumina and ABI-SOLiD sequencing machines.

We propose a genome-wide, alignment-free genomic distance based on compressed maximal exact matches and suggest adding it to the benchmark of commonly used assembly quality metrics. Maximal exact matches are perfect repeats, without gaps or misspellings, which cannot be further extended to either their left- or right-end side without loss of similarity. The genomic distance here proposed is based on the normalized compression distance, an information-theoretic measure of the relative compressibility of two sequences estimated using multiple finite-context models. This measure exposes similarities between the sequences, as well as, the nesting structure underlying the assembly of larger maximal exact matches from smaller ones. We use four human genome assemblies for illustration and discuss the impact of genome sequencing and assembly in the final content of maximal exact matches and the genomic distance here proposed. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",

In particular, the following questions remain open: Is the phenomenon of symmetry statistically significant? If so, what is the word length above which significance is lost? Can deviations in symmetry due to the finite size of the data be identified? This work addresses these questions by studying word symmetries in the human genome, chromosomes and transcriptome. To rule out finite-length effects, the results are compared with those obtained from random control sequences built to satisfy Chargaff's second parity rule. We use several techniques to evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, a novel word symmetry distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. We conclude that word symmetries are statistical significant in the human genome for word lengths up to 6. nucleotides.

Tel.: +351 234370650. Previous studies have suggested that Chargaff's second rule may hold for relatively long words (above 10nucleotides), but this has not been conclusively shown. In particular, the following questions remain open: Is the phenomenon of symmetry statistically significant? If so, what is the word length above which significance is lost? Can deviations in symmetry due to the finite size of the data be identified? This work addresses these questions by studying word symmetries in the human genome, chromosomes and transcriptome. To rule out finite-length effects, the results are compared with those obtained from random control sequences built to satisfy Chargaff's second parity rule. We use several techniques to evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, a novel word symmetry distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. We conclude that word symmetries are statistical significant in the human genome for word lengths up to 6nucleotides. For longer words, we present evidence that the phenomenon may not be as prevalent as previously thought. Keywords Single strand symmetry Oligonucleotide composition Word symmetry distance Equivalence testing 1 Introduction The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA (Watson and Crick, 1953) made evident that the total percentage of complementary nucleotides (A–T and C–G) in a double-stranded molecule should be equal. This property had been previously reported by Chargaff and it is accordingly known as Chargaff's (1950) first parity rule. The detailed analysis of some bacterial genomes led to the formulation of Chargaff's second parity rule, which asserts that the percentage of complementary nucleotides should also be equal in each of the two strands (Rudner et al., 1968a, 1968b; Karkas et al., 1968). This rule has been extensively confirmed in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, including more recent results (e.g. Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Baisnée et al., 2002; Albrecht-Buehler, 2007; Kong et al., 2009; Zhang and Huang, 2010), that use global association measures and suggest that the symmetry holds for words with up to 10nucleotides (nt). However, the universality of Chargaff's second parity rule has been questioned for organellar DNA and some viral genomes (Mitchell and Bridge, 2006). A natural extension of Chargaff's second parity rule is that, in each DNA strand, the number of occurrences of a given word should match that of its reversed complement. A genomic word, or oligonucleotide, of length k is here interchangeably denoted as a k-mer. Moreover, we refer to the reversed complement as the symmetric word and the pair constituted by both words as a symmetric pair. The symmetry phenomenon that we aim to investigate pertains to the distributions of symmetric pairs, i.e. the distribution of all words and the distribution of the corresponding reversed complements. We focus our study on the complete human genome, on each chromosome and on the transcriptome. As far as we know, previous works do not answer the following question: Are the observed discrepancies between the empirical distributions of the k-mers and their reversed complements, for each k, sufficiently small to infer that they are modeled by the same probability law, and is the phenomenon of the symmetry of DNA sequences statistically significant? Caution is required regarding the application of some traditional statistical tests, which can yield irrelevant or even misleading results, as reported in Baisnée et al. (2002). We adopt a number of independent approaches to detect the word length k above which the single strand symmetry ceases, or partially ceases, to exist. We use a number of standard statistical tools and introduce an adapted version of a multiple equivalence test. We also introduce a word symmetry distance based on Ulam's metric. The contributions in this work lead to the identification in the human genome of the range of word lengths for which symmetry is statistically significant, as well as the threshold beyond which it seems to break. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials We analyze the human genome and use the reference assembly build 37.3 available from the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information discarding all non-sequenced nucleotides (N) from the analysis. All chromosomes and the transcriptome of the human genome were processed as separate sequences. The words were counted with overlapping. We generated 24 random control sequences of the same size as the sequences of corresponding human chromosomes. The model used to generate the random sequences assumes Chargaff's second parity rule: the probability of occurrence of complement nucleotides is equal ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) and the probability of occurrence of each pair of complement nucleotides is estimated as the average of the nucleotides frequency of occurrence in the corresponding human chromosome. The sequences used in this work are denoted as follows: • human chromosomes: H c ; • random control chromosomes: RC c ; • whole assembled human genome: H a ; • whole assembled random control sequences: RC a ; • transcriptome of human genome: RNA. 2.2 Methods For a given word length k, we compare the frequency distribution of all words and the frequency distribution of their reversed complements, in order to evaluate the symmetry phenomenon. We use several methods, including some well-known measures 1. Pearson's correlation coefficient (C), 2. Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL), 3. total variational distance (S 1), which is a normalized L 1 distance (L 1 distance divided by 2) (Dembo and Karlin, 1992). We also use the well-known chi-square test to assess the statistically significance of the exact symmetry (that is, to check whether the probabilities of words and the corresponding reversed complements are equal). Furthermore, we propose two novel methods based on equivalence tests and Ulam's metric, described below. 2.2.1 Equivalence tests Let π 1 , π 2 denote the (population) proportions of one word and its corresponding reversed complement (a symmetric pair). Let p 1, p 2 denote the corresponding sample proportions. Traditional statistical hypothesis testing may be used to assess the differences between two proportions. However, it is well known that when traditional hypothesis tests are applied to large data sets, any small effect is always deemed significant (Moore, 1997; Kline, 2004; Migliorati and Ongaro, 2010). To overcome this drawback, we use equivalence tests for accepting/rejecting the equivalence hypotheses between the proportions of symmetric words. Because the word proportions may have low (or very low) values, particularly for large k, the differences between them may not be a good measure for evaluating discrepancies. Hence, we study the proportion ratio π 1 / π 2 . The statistical hypotheses for the equivalence test are H 0 : π 1 / π 2 ≥ δ or π 1 / π 2 ≤ 1 / δ vs H 1 : 1 / δ < π 1 / π 2 < δ . here δ ( > 1 ) represents a small tolerance used to conclude a practical equivalence between the proportions of symmetric words. For convenience, the hypotheses above are formulated only for one pair of symmetric words, but they represent all pairs of symmetric words. The ratio between two proportions, r = p 1 / p 2 , is an effect size measure. As in many studies, e.g. Thanassoulis and Vasan (2010), we consider the effect to be weak when it assumes values between 1.1 and 1.3 and we explore these lower effect size values as a tolerance to conclude about practical equivalence. The confidence interval for the unknown true value of π 1 / π 2 , considering the ln-method of Katz et al. (1978), for a given α , is ( p 1 p 2 e − z 1 − α / 2 1 / n 1 − 1 / N + 1 / n 2 − 1 / N ; p 1 p 2 e z 1 − α / 2 1 / n 1 − 1 / N + 1 / n 2 − 1 / N ) where n 1 and n 2 are the number of occurrences of the corresponding words and N is the total number of word occurrences. The equivalence tests procedure consists of obtaining the confidence interval for the proportion ratios and checking if it is contained within the interval ( 1 / δ , δ ) . If so, H 0 is rejected and the equivalence can be assumed. For each word length k, we performed 4 k equivalence tests. When all of the 4 k null hypotheses are rejected, we consider that the distributions of symmetric pairs (i.e. the distribution of occurrence of all words and the distribution of occurrence of their corresponding reversed complements) are equivalent. 2.2.2 Word symmetry distance For a given word length k, the distribution of original words is sorted by frequency values and the final arrangement is denoted as A 1 ( k ) . A second arrangement, A 2 ( k ) , is obtained by sorting symmetric pairs according to the largest frequency value of each pair. In this way, symmetric words are kept adjacent and elements of the pair are sorted according to their frequencies. For illustration, consider an arrangement of the dinucleotides A 1 ( 2 ) [ AA AT TT AG CT AC GT CA CG TG GA GC TC CC GG TA ] and the corresponding arrangement A 2 ( 2 ) [ AA TT AT AG CT AC GT CA TG CG GA TC GC CC GG TA ] . Under the assumption of the symmetry phenomenon, A 1 ( k ) should be equal to A 2 ( k ) . Deviations from this ideal symmetry are quantified using Ulam's metric, which is the minimum number of moves required to go from arrangement A 1 to arrangement A 2. This metric, denoted as U ( A 1 ; A 2 ) , is related with the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence (Aldous and Diaconis, 1999). For the example above U ( A 1 ( 2 ) ; A 2 ( 2 ) ) = 3 . As a consequence of the definition of A 2 and for a fixed word length k, the maximum Ulam distance is max { U ( A 1 ( k ) ; A 2 ( k ) ) } = 4 k / 2 . Therefore, we introduce a word symmetry distance given by Ws ( k ) = 2 4 k U ( A 1 ( k ) ; A 2 ( k ) ) , where Ws ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , with values close to zero indicating that the distributions of symmetric pairs are nearly identical, and values close to one reflecting the opposite. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Symmetry hypothesis testing To evaluate the exact symmetry hypothesis for different word lengths (that is, whether the probability of a word equals the probability of its reversed complement) we use the χ 2 goodness of fit test. For random data generated according to the hypothesis, the test should of course reveal non-significant differences. Table 1 presents the p-values of the goodness of fit test of the studied sequences. As expected, the null hypothesis is confirmed for the random sequences, but it is rejected for the human genomic sequences. For the random control sequences (RC c , RC a ), generated with equal A/T and C/G compositions, the exact symmetry phenomenon prevails for the studied word lengths. This is not observed in the human sequences (H c , H a , RNA). Since the random and human sequences have the same length, this cannot be due to the sample size. It is known that for sample sizes like those we use and for a reasonable number of categories, the differences between proportions have a large chance of being detected. The irrelevance of the traditional statistical tests when used to evaluate the symmetry phenomenon was also pointed out in Baisnée et al. (2002). Therefore, we applied statistical tests of equivalence to the data, and tested if the proportion ratios are close to one. Table 2 presents the results of equivalence tests for the proportions ratio for the studied sequences. Tolerances close to δ are often used. We present the percentage of equivalent symmetric pairs for two tolerances: δ = 1.3 and the more strict δ = 1.1 . To interpret the equivalence test results one should take into consideration the value of the tolerance and the size of the studied sequences. In order to check for the presence or importance of a possible finite-size effect, we use the random sequences as control sequences. Obviously, in an infinite random sequence generated as described before, we would expect to observe the symmetry phenomenon (similar frequencies for all symmetric pairs), regardless of the word lengths. If this is not observed in a finite sample, there is reason to suspect sample-size effects. Table 2 shows the results obtained. Consider first δ = 1.3 . The percentage of equivalent word pairs for the human sequence H a is below 100% for word lengths above 8, and below 85% for word length 10. This stands in contrast to what is observed in the random sequence RC a , which, despite having the same length as H a , shows 100% equivalent pairs for all word lengths up to 10. Thus, the decrease observed in H a cannot be due to the sample size. In the case of the shorter random sequences RC c , the table shows a decrease in the percentage of equivalent pairs, starting with length 8. However, the decrease in the case of the human sequences H c is stronger and starts for length 6. Thus, although the effect of the finite sample size cannot be entirely ruled out, the difference between the two cases remains nevertheless clear. The case δ = 1.1 confirms this. Under this tighter tolerance, deviations from 100% equivalent pairs can be noted both in the random data and in the human data. However, the differences between the human and the random cases remain considerable and cannot be entirely explained by the limited sample size. The RNA sequence shows symmetry deviations already for very small word lengths ( k > 3 when δ = 1.1 , and k > 1 when δ = 1.3 ). We observe a much higher percentage of non-equivalent pairs in comparison with the random sequences RC c , which is of a comparable size (RNA has about 134 megabases and the average size of the chromosomes is about 129 megabases). Table 3 presents a summary of the occurrence ratios for symmetric pairs. The table shows the maximum ratio ( max r ), 95th percentile ratio (P 95r ) and 75th percentile ratio (P 75r ) between the proportions of the words in each symmetric pair. For words of length 10nt, a maximum value of 17 was observed. This means that at least one word occurred 17 times more than the corresponding symmetric word. However, in all k-mers the majority of ratios assume low values: the 95th percentile ratio is lower than 1.2 and the 75th percentile ratio is lower than 1.1. In general, for the complete human genome (H a ), and for the corresponding random sequence (RC a ), symmetric pairs have ratio values close to 1. However, for k > 7 , we observe some pairs with high (or very high) ratio values which is in accordance with the equivalence test results. When k > 7 , not all word symmetric pairs can be considered equivalent. We carried out an exploratory analysis of the content of these word pairs. For each pair we searched for the presence of oligonucleotides (with 1–5 symbols). Table 4 shows the four most frequent oligonucleotides (nucleotide to tetranucleotide) present in non-equivalent pairs. For 8-mers, 9-mers and 10-mers we observe that all words in the non-equivalent pairs have a rich C/G content, i.e. all words contain C, G and CG. Moreover, a high percentage of nonequivalent pairs contains CGCG. This evidence is in accordance with the observation first made several decades ago (Josse et al., 1961) of the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) in the human genome, hypothesized to be a consequence of the hypermutability of CpGs due to the increased mutation rate of 5-methylcytosine followed by the inaccurate mismatch repair of deaminated 5-methylcytosine (i.e. uracil) that introduces a thymine upon replication (Bird, 1980). Finally, we note that our listing of non-equivalent pairs may represent words involved in evolutionary processes that may be distinct for different word lengths (Nikolaou and Almirantis, 2005; Bush and Lahn, 2006). 3.2 Pearson's correlation coefficient, Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) and total variational distance Table 5 presents the results of several techniques to evaluate the word symmetry phenomenon. We present Pearson's correlation coefficient values, which suggest a strong word symmetry phenomenon, in line with the previous work in this area (Albrecht-Buehler, 2006; Prabhu, 1993). However, it is well known that this coefficient is not robust to outliers, such as poly-A and poly-T words. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence and total variational distance (S 1) results are in agreement with Pearson's correlation coefficient (C): words and symmetric words distributions are close, at least for words of length up to 10nt. C and 1 − S 1 assume values between zero and one, and values higher than 0.9 correspond to a strong association. Kullback–Leibler divergence assumes values in (0, ∞ ), with greater values corresponding to larger distances. These measures, C, S 1 and KL, may be overstating the symmetry phenomenon, because they only evaluate the global agreement between all corresponding values in both distributions (words vs corresponding symmetric words) and not if this agreement is the strongest among all possible pairs. 3.3 Word symmetry distance In order to measure the strength of the symmetry phenomenon, we introduced a new word symmetry distance, Ws. In the complete human genome (H a ) we observe (see Table 5) that for smaller k-mers ( k < 4 ), the symmetric words permutation is the closest to the original distribution. For larger k-mers ( k ≥ 4 ), there are other nearest permutations. However, for k=4 and k=5, we obtain a small distance, which leads us to conclude that the phenomenon of symmetry is still reasonably strong. For k ≥ 6 the symmetric words permutation is increasingly more distant from the original distribution. To better characterize the fading of the symmetry phenomenon, we estimate the percentage of symmetric word pairs that are spaced at most d words in A 1 (the arrangement of words is sorted by their frequencies). Fig. 1 presents these percentages for d < 50 . Naturally, we observe that the distances between symmetric words increase with the word length. For the random complete genome (RC a ) we observe that word symmetry distances reach higher values than for the human genome, indicating a lower symmetry in random sequences when compared with the corresponding human genome. In Table 5, for 1 < k < 7 and for the complete human genome we obtain a word symmetry distance lower than in the random sequences. For k > 6 the random and human complete genomes present similar word symmetry distances. This result seems to contradict previous ones obtained by the equivalence and the traditional hypothesis test. However, from all these results, we observe that the differences between frequencies of symmetric words in the random sequences are lower than in the human sequences. In the sorted frequency vector the distances between symmetric words in the random sequences are higher than in the human sequences. The random control sequences were generated to model Chargaff's second parity rule ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) thus it is expected that the frequency of occurrence of any word is similar to that of its reversed complement. This similarity is expected for any word length. Since, for word lengths greater than 1 ( k > 1 ) there are groups of words whose expected frequencies are similar (e.g. AAA, AAT, ATA, ATT, TAA, TAT, TTA, TTT), we do not expect null distances between the frequencies of the symmetric word pairs in the vector sorted by the frequency of occurrence. Thus, the results obtained for the word symmetry distance of the random sequences are in agreement with the expected values. In addition, to better characterize the symmetry phenomenon, for each k-mer, we find the maximum distance between two symmetric words ( max d ) in A 1. Note that the maximum distance between two words in a general arrangement is 4 k − 1 . Because of this, we propose a normalized maximum distance max ′ d = max d / ( 4 k − 1 ) . In Table 5 we observe that in the complete human genome (H a ) the normalized maximum distance is small ( < 0.1 ) for k-mers of length 1–9nt, but larger for 10-mers. If we consider a threshold of 0.05, the symmetry phenomenon is relevant for words of length up to 8nt. In the random complete sequence (RC a ) using the normalized maximum distance with 0.05 threshold, the symmetry phenomenon is relevant only for k=1 and takes values similar to the complete human genome only for k=1 or k=10. In order to compare the symmetry results for the random control sequences with the corresponding human chromosomes and RNA sequences, we present some plots in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 we observe that the word symmetry distances in RNA and the random control sequences are very similar. In the human chromosome sequences the average values of the word symmetry for 1 < k < 8 suggest higher symmetry than in random or RNA sequences. Fig. 3 shows two scatter plots to study the size effect in word symmetry distance, for k=7 and k=10. For random sequences, the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient between chromosome size and word symmetry distance is lower than 0.5 for k ≤ 8 and for k > 8 the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient is higher than 0.80. This difference might arise from the finite sample size. These results emphasize the hypothesis that for k > 8 the effect of the sample size begins to be noticeable, as already suggested in the context of equivalence testing. 4 Conclusion We used several criteria to compare distributions of words and their reversed complements, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, a novel word symmetry distance, the normalized maximum distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. Our results for relatively short words agree with and reinforce previous evidence in the literature (Albrecht-Buehler, 2006; Baisnée et al., 2002; Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Prabhu, 1993). The several measures used complement each other, providing a broader description of the symmetry phenomenon. In terms of frequency similarity, the symmetry was assessed with the total variational distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, traditional and equivalence hypothesis tests. In terms of correlation the symmetry was described by Pearson's coefficient. In terms of the distance between symmetric words in sorted frequency vector the symmetry was discussed by the word symmetry distance and the normalized maximum distance. We compared the human sequences with random control sequences ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) of the same length, to understand the onset of finite sample size effects. An infinite random sequence generated subject to π A = π T and π C = π G should exhibit the symmetry phenomenon (similar frequencies for all symmetric pairs), regardless of the word length. A failure to detect this symmetry in a finite sample sequence reveals a limitation in the sample size. The human genome deviates from the symmetry more rapidly than the control sequences. For example, in the complete human genome, the equivalence testing shows that the symmetry phenomenon is statistically significant at least for words of length up to 6nt. As the word length increases, the strength of the symmetry phenomenon in the complete human genome decreases, but does so more rapidly than in the control sequences. In terms of distances between symmetric words, the symmetry remains higher than in the control sequences, at least for 1 < k < 7 . However, for k > 6 , high distance values can be found in both cases (word symmetry distance > 90 % ). The analysis of our results shows that, globally, Chargaff's second parity rule only holds for small oligonucleotides, in the human genome. However, there are some large oligonucleotides for which the extension of Chargaff's second parity holds. We also proposed new methods to evaluate the distance between symmetric words in the sorted frequency vector. The new methods evaluate the word length k s at which symmetry ceases to exist. The results obtained point to similar thresholds ( 5 ≤ k s ≤ 7 ). This suggests that the phenomenon of symmetry is not as strong as previously thought. Furthermore, in the case of RNA, this is especially notorious, even for the smallest word lengths. The deviations from perfect symmetry are more pronounced for large word lengths, for which the sample size limit might become an issue. Therefore, we were careful to subtract this effect from the analysis. We based our conclusions on a set of methods, not on a single one; statistical significance was a major concern; and we systematically used control sequences to detect the onset of problems due to limited sample sizes. We feel that our results provide a broad picture of the symmetry phenomenon in the human genome and the extent to which it holds.

However, its application in acute respiratory diseases (e.g., LRTI) is not well established. The objective and reliable measurement of adventitious lung sounds (ALS), such as wheezes, has the potential to contribute to respiratory physiotherapy evidence base. This paper reports on the implementation of reliable and published automatic wheeze and respiratory phase detectors to assess wheezing parameters pre/post respiratory physiotherapy treatment in patients with LRTI. Twenty patients with LRTI were randomly allocated to control group, which received standard medication treatment, or experimental group, which received standard medication plus respiratory physiotherapy treatment. Respiratory sounds were recorded in seven chest locations. Wheeze parameters, namely occupation rate, main frequency, duration and type were obtained per respiratory phase. Wheeze occupation rate was statistically significantly reduced in both groups following treatment (p<0.001). There was a greater reduction in wheeze occupation rate in the experimental group reaching statistical significance for the inspiratory phase (p=0.019). This promising result indicates the potential value of respiratory physiotherapy in LRTI. It also highlights the potential to use acoustic methods to establish respiratory physiotherapy efficacy.",

However, it is still not clear how strong and exceptional this phenomenon is. We use next-generation sequencing data from a sample of 1,092 human individuals made available by the 1000 Genomes Project. To evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry of single-strand human genomic DNA, we explore and analyze these 1,092 human genomes and 1,092 randomly generated sequences, each forced to mimic the nucleotide frequency distribution of their real counterpart.

By statistical testing we find that the global symmetries phenomenon is significant for word lengths smaller than 8. When we evaluate the global symmetry scores, we obtain strong values for all word lengths and both types of sequences under study. However, the symmetry scores in human genomes reach higher values and have lower dispersion than those in random sequences. We also find that human and random symmetry scores are significantly different. We conclude that in the human genome, the differences between symmetric words are higher than in random sequences, but the correlation between symmetric words in human genomes is higher. © 2013 Penerbit UTM Press.

        "doc_abstract": "One of the most important tasks on robot soccer is localization. The team robots should self-localize on the 18 x 12 meters soccer field. Since a few years ago the soccer field has increased and the corner posts were removed and that increased the localization task complexity. One important aspect to take care for a proper localization is to find out the robot orientation. This paper proposes a new technique to calculate the robot orientation. The proposed method consists of using a histogram of white-green transitions (to detect the lines on the field) to know the robot orientation. This technique does not take much computational time and proves to be very reliable. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The validation of these algorithms is based on the comparison of their results with reference annotations and therefore requires the development of user-friendly annotation software. This paper presents an application, developed in Matlab®, for the annotation of respiratory sounds. The user can identify respiratory cycles and adventitious sounds - crackles and wheezes - directly on the waveforms displayed on the screen, which may be simultaneously played back. The audio playback speed is user-adjustable and synchronised with the cursor display. Specific annotation file storage formats were defined. Preliminary usability tests performed by three health professionals using twenty respiratory sound files from six patients (with pneumonia and cystic fibrosis) indicate that the software is user-friendly and effective, allowing simple and quick annotations.",

Here, we explore different sets of minimal absent words in the genomes of 22 organisms (one archaeota, thirteen bacteria and eight eukaryotes). We investigate if the mutational biases that may explain the deficit of the shortest absent words in vertebrates are also pervasive in other absent words, namely in minimal absent words, as well as to other organisms. We find that the compositional biases observed for the shortest absent words in vertebrates are not uniform throughout different sets of minimal absent words. We further investigate the hypothesis of the inheritance of minimal absent words through common ancestry from the similarity in dinucleotide relative abundances of different sets of minimal absent words, and find that this inheritance may be exclusive to vertebrates. © 2011 Garcia et al.",

        "doc_abstract": "When a team of robots is built with the objective of playing soccer, the coordination and control algorithms must reason, decide and actuate based on the current conditions of the robot and its surroundings. This is where sensor and information fusion techniques appear, providing the means to build an accurate model of the world around the robot, based on its own limited sensor information and the also limited information obtained through communication with the team mates. One of the most important elements of the world model is the robot self-localization, as to be able to decide what to do in an effective way, it must know its position in the field of play. In this paper, the team localization algorithm is presented focusing on the integration of visual and compass information. An important element in a soccer game, perhaps the most important, is the ball. To improve the estimations of the ball position and velocity, two different techniques have been developed. A study of the visual sensor noise is presented and, according to this analysis, the resulting noise variation is used to define the parameters of a Kalman filter for ball position estimation. Moreover, linear regression is used for velocity estimation purposes, both for the ball and the robot. This implementation of linear regression has an adaptive buffer size so that, on hard deviations from the path (detected using the Kalman filter), the regression converges faster. A team cooperation method based on sharing the ball position is presented. Other important data during the soccer game is obstacle data. This is an important challenge for cooperation purposes, allowing the improvement of team strategy with ball covering, dribble corridor estimation, pass lines, among other strategic possibilities. Thus, detecting the obstacles is ceasing to be enough and identifying which obstacles are team mates and opponents is becoming a need. An approach for this identification is presented, considering the visual information, the known characteristics of the team robots and shared localization among team members. The described work was implemented on the CAMBADA team and allowed it to achieve particularly good performances in the last two years, with a 1st and a 3rd place in the world championship RoboCup 2008 and RoboCup 2009 editions, respectively, as well as distinctively achieve 1st place in 2008 and 2009 editions of the Portuguese Robotics Open. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

When a team of robots is built with the objective of playing soccer, the coordination and control algorithms must reason, decide and actuate based on the current conditions of the robot and its surroundings. This is where sensor and information fusion techniques appear, providing the means to build an accurate model of the world around the robot, based on its own limited sensor information and the also limited information obtained through communication with the team mates. One of the most important elements of the world model is the robot self-localization, as to be able to decide what to do in an effective way, it must know its position in the field of play. In this paper, the team localization algorithm is presented focusing on the integration of visual and compass information. An important element in a soccer game, perhaps the most important, is the ball. To improve the estimations of the ball position and velocity, two different techniques have been developed. A study of the visual sensor noise is presented and, according to this analysis, the resulting noise variation is used to define the parameters of a Kalman filter for ball position estimation. Moreover, linear regression is used for velocity estimation purposes, both for the ball and the robot. This implementation of linear regression has an adaptive buffer size so that, on hard deviations from the path (detected using the Kalman filter), the regression converges faster. A team cooperation method based on sharing the ball position is presented. Other important data during the soccer game is obstacle data. This is an important challenge for cooperation purposes, allowing the improvement of team strategy with ball covering, dribble corridor estimation, pass lines, among other strategic possibilities. Thus, detecting the obstacles is ceasing to be enough and identifying which obstacles are team mates and opponents is becoming a need. An approach for this identification is presented, considering the visual information, the known characteristics of the team robots and shared localization among team members. The described work was implemented on the CAMBADA team and allowed it to achieve particularly good performances in the last two years, with a 1st and a 3rd place in the world championship RoboCup 2008 and RoboCup 2009 editions, respectively, as well as distinctively achieve 1st place in 2008 and 2009 editions of the Portuguese Robotics Open. Keywords Sensor fusion World model Kalman filter Linear regression Obstacle detection Visual matching 1 Introduction Nowadays, there are several research domains in the area of multi robot systems. One of the most popular is robotic soccer. RoboCup 1 1 is an international joint project to promote artificial intelligence, robotics and related fields. Most of the RoboCup leagues have soccer as platform for developing technology, either at software or hardware levels, with single or multiple agents, cooperative or competitive [1]. Among RoboCup leagues, the Middle Size League (MSL) is one of the most challenging. In this league, each team is composed of up to five robots with maximum size of 50×50cm base, 80cm height and a maximum weight of 40kg, playing in a field of 18×12m. The rules of the game are similar to the official FIFA rules, with required changes to adapt for the playing robots [2]. Each robot is autonomous and has its own sensorial means. They can communicate with each other, and with an external computer acting as a coach, through a wireless network. This coach computer cannot have any sensor, it only knows what is reported by the playing robots. The agents should be able to evaluate the state of the world and make decisions suitable to fulfill the cooperative team objective. CAMBADA, Cooperative Autonomous Mobile roBots with Advanced Distributed Architecture, is the Middle Size League Robotic Soccer team from the University of Aveiro. The project started in 2003, coordinated by the IEETA 2 Instituto de Engenharia Electrónica e Telemática de Aveiro – Aveiro’s Institute of Electronic and Telematic Engineering. 2 ATRI 3 Actividade Transversal em Robótica Inteligente – Transverse Activity on Intelligent Robotics. 3 group and involves people working on several areas for building the mechanical structure of the robot, its hardware architecture and controllers and the software development in areas such as image analysis and processing, sensor and information fusion, reasoning and control (see Fig. 1 ). This paper provides a description of some sensor and information fusion techniques and algorithms used in the CAMBADA team. The data obtained by these techniques are necessary for building a world model of the robot environment. This paper includes the description of some of the elements of that model necessary for a team of robots to play soccer. In Section 2, a brief overview of some related topics and work in sensor and information fusion for world modeling are presented. Section 3 presents the team self-localization description, introducing it as the first necessary step for all the other information fusion. In Section 4, the ball integration process is presented in all its components, starting with the ball position, its velocity and finally its sharing among team mates. Section 5 presents an overview of obstacle treatment, with some visual detection details, the matching of positions for visual identification and the sharing of information among team mates. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related work World modeling and sensor and information fusion are tightly related, as the latest provide the means to build the desired model. Sensor and information fusion is the process of combining sensory data, or data derived from sensory data, providing a resulting information that is better than would be possible when the sources were used individually [3]. One of the main areas where sensor fusion techniques are used is position tracking, both for self and object localization/tracking. The integration of information over time in order to filter sensor noise is essential to get better estimates. This type of integration may be performed using Kalman filter based approaches, Monte Carlo methods or Markov approaches. Generally, Monte Carlo [4] approaches have better performance in cases where great discontinuities of the output values are expected, as the assumption of Gaussian probability density functions of the Kalman filter [5] is usually less accurate. However, Kalman filtering is a very effective method if the assumptions of Gaussian noise can be met and the system can be linearized. Other common approaches are the use of the Extended and Unscented Kalman filters [6], which are prepared to deal with non-linear systems at the cost of more computational weight. A general overview of different methods of multi-sensor and information fusion is presented in [7], also with a brief description of application areas, such as robotics, military, biomedical and transportation. Applications in the robotics field include self-localization using either Kalman filter [8], Monte Carlo [9] or Markov [10] methods, or integration of information coming from several robots, to increase the accuracy of each of the robots position estimation [11]. A general recent overview of methods and architectures for multi-sensor data fusion can be found in [12]. Another recurrent problem nowadays is the fusion of visual and inertial sensors [13], where recent results have demonstrated that the visual tracking of objects may work at higher velocities and be more robust if combined with information coming from inertial sensors [14] and also that ego-motion estimation can be more precise and navigation more robust using these approaches [15]. Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is another common application of sensor fusion techniques, as in many cases, autonomous robots have to map the environment rather than simply localize themselves [16,17]. Particularly in RoboCup domain, several teams use this kind of approaches, not only for localization purposes, but also for position estimation and tracking of objects, namely the ball and other robots. Several teams have used Kalman filters for the ball position estimation [18–21]. In [20,21], several information fusion methods are compared for the integration of the ball position using several observers. In [21], the authors conclude that the Kalman reset filter shows the best performance. Although using well known techniques, in this paper we propose practical solutions for an efficient self-localization, ball information treatment and obstacle treatment for an MSL robotic soccer team. As far as we know, no previous work has been published focusing on these several important aspects of developing the world model of an MSL soccer team. 3 Localization Self-localization of the agent is an important issue for a soccer team, as strategic moves and positioning must be defined by positions on the field. In the MSL, the environment is partially known, as every agent knows exactly the layout of the game field but does not know the position of any other elements, either itself, other robots or the ball. Given the known map, the agent has then to locate itself. The CAMBADA team localization algorithm is based on the detected field lines, with fusion of information from the odometry sensors and an electronic compass. It is based on the approach described in [22], with some adaptations. It can be seen as an error minimization task, with a derived measure of reliability of the calculated position so that a stochastic sensor fusion process can be applied to increase the estimation accuracy [22]. From the center of the image (the center of the robot), radial sensors are created around the robot, each one represented by a line with a given angle. These are called scanlines. The image processing, in each cycle, returns a list of positions relative to the robot where the scanlines intercept the field line markings [23]. The idea is to analyze the detected line points, estimating a position, and through an error function describe the fitness of the estimation. This is done by reducing the error of the matching between the detected lines and the known field lines (Fig. 2 ). The error function must be defined considering the substantial amount of noise that affects the detected line points which would distort the representation estimation [22]. In normal operation mode, the localization is done over a limited set of base positions from which tracking is maintained. Since it is an algorithm based on optimization and since there are many local minima, the tracking only works satisfactorily if the estimations are near the solution. In situations where the robot does not possess a valid estimation, a global localization algorithm estimates the robot position on the field using a much wider set of initial estimations over which the already referred error minimization process for optimization is applied. However, this global localization algorithm is computationally heavy and time consuming. For that reason, after having an initial position, the simpler tracking localization handles the cyclic relocation. Although the odometry measurement quality quickly degrades with time, within the reduced cycle times achieved in the application, consecutive readings produce acceptable results and thus, having the visual estimation, it is fused with the odometry values to refine the estimation. This fusion is based on a Kalman filter for the robot position estimated by odometry and the robot position estimated by visual information. This approach allows the agent to estimate its position even if no visual information is available. However, it is not reliable to use only odometry values to estimate the position for more than a few cycles, as slidings and frictions on the wheels produce large errors on the estimations in short time. Due to the nature of the approach, this algorithm works acceptably with a relatively low number of points, like a few tens of points, as long as they are representative of the surroundings. Consider the case of matching a 90degrees corner. If the algorithm had access to 200 points all over the same line, it would not be capable of matching the corner. On the other hand, with only 20 or 30 points scattered over both lines, the algorithm would be capable of detecting the match. Even in situations where the points are over the same line, the merging with odometry and position tracking provide a good robustness to the algorithm [22], as long as the situation is temporary, which is usually the case. The visually estimated orientation can be ambiguous, i.e. each point on the soccer field has a symmetric position, relatively to the field center, where the robot detects exactly the same field lines. To disambiguate the symmetry problem and to detect wrong estimations, an electronic compass is used. The orientation estimated by the robot is compared to the orientation given by the compass and if the error between them is larger than a predefined threshold, actions are taken. If the error is really large (i.e. around ±180degrees), it means that the robot estimated orientation is symmetric to the real one, so it should assume the mirror position. On the other hand, if the error is larger than the acceptance threshold (i.e. a 90degrees acceptable area), a counter is incremented (Fig. 3 ). This counter will be incremented every cycle in which the error is greater than the threshold. If a given number of consecutive cycles with high errors is reached (i.e. the counter reaches a given number, currently 10), the robot considers itself “lost”, meaning that it will not continue to track its position but will instead consider the initial situation, with no a priori knowledge and thus executes the global localization algorithm. Fig. 4 shows situations where the threshold was reached and relocation was forced after some cycles. 4 Ball integration The information of the ball state (position and velocity) is, perhaps, the most important, as it is the main object of the game and it is the base over which most decisions are taken. Thus, its integration has to be as reliable as possible. To accomplish this, a Kalman filter implementation was created to filter the estimated ball position given by the visual information, and a linear regression was applied over filtered positions to estimate its velocity. 4.1 Ball position It is assumed that the ball velocity is constant between cycles. Although that is not true, due to the short time variations between cycles, around 40ms, and given the noisy environment and measurement errors, it is a quite acceptable model for the ball movement. Thus, no friction is considered to affect the ball, and the model does not include any kind of control over the ball. Therefore, given the Kalman filter formulation (described in [24]), the assumed state transition model is given by X k = 1 Δ T 0 1 X k - 1 where X k = Pos Vel is the state vector containing the position and velocity of the ball. Both are composed by the respective (x, y) coordinates. This velocity is only internally estimated by the filter, as the robot sensors can only take measurements on the ball position. After defining the state transition model based on the ball movement assumptions described above and the observation model, the description of the measurements and process noises are important issues to attend. The measurements noise can be statistically estimated by taking measurements of a static ball position at known distances. In practice, measurements of the static ball were taken while the robot was rotating around its vertical axis and this was done with the ball placed at several distances, measured with metric tape. Although real game conditions are probably more adverse, we lack the means to externally know the position of the elements on the field. For that reason, to know the real distance between the robot and the ball, we opted to use the described setup. Some of the results are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The standard deviation of those measurements can be used to calculate the variance and thus define the measurements noise parameter. A relation between the distance of the ball to the robot and the measurements standard deviation can be modeled by a 2nd degree polynomial best fitting the data set in a least-squares sense. Depending on the available data, a polynomial of another degree could be used, but we should always keep in mind the computational weight of increasing complexity. As for the process noise, this is not trivial to estimate, since there is no way to take independent measurements of the process to estimate its standard deviation. The process noise is represented by a matrix containing the covariances correspondent to the state variable vector. Based on the Kalman filter functioning, one can verify that forcing a near null process noise causes the filter to practically ignore the read measures, leading the filter to emphasize the model prediction. This makes it too smooth and therefore inappropriate. On the other hand, if it is too high, the read measures are taken too much into account and the filter returns the measures themselves. To face this situation, one has to find a compromise between stability and reaction. Since we assume an uniform movement for the ball, there are no frictions or other external forces considered. This means that accelerations are not considered in our model and thus, the position and velocity components are quite independent of each other. Since acceleration is the main element of relation between position and velocity, we considered that the errors associated to the process position and velocity estimations do not correlate. Because we assume an uniform movement model that we know is not the true nature of the system, we know that the speed calculation of the model is not very accurate. A process noise covariance matrix was empirically estimated, based on several tests, so that a good smoothness/reactivity relationship was kept. These empirically estimated values were made dependent on the measurement noise so that the Kalman filter predictions are also less accurate when the distance to the ball is too large. This was done so that the filter does not smooth the positions too much. In practice, this approach proved to improve the estimation of the ball position. Since we do not possess the means to externally know the positions of the elements on the field, a capture was made with the ball fixed at a known position on the field (0.0,2.0) (measured with metric tape). The robot was moving around the ball with a speed of 1.3±0.5m/s and the ball position measured at each moment was recorded. The ball position measured by the robot was (−0.01,2.03)±(0.05,0.06)m. Fig. 6 illustrates the capture results. This experiment gives an idea of the noise associated with the ball position detection. Note that during the experiment the distance between the robot and the ball is around 2m. Comparing the ball position cloud with the one obtained at 2m in Fig. 5 one can verify that they are similar, which is consistent with the previous experiment setup to simulate robot movement by rotation on the spot. With the presented setup experiments, the existence of noise in ball measurements became clear. With that existent noise in mind, several tests were made to validate the use of the Kalman filter to reduce it. Fig. 7 represents a capture of one of those tests, a ball movement, where the black dots are the ball positions measured by the robot visual sensors and thus are unfiltered. Red stars 4 For interpretation of color in ‘Figs. 1,2,4-7,9-11,13-15,17-20’ the reader is referred to the web version of this article. 4 represent the position estimations after applying the Kalman filter. The robot position is represented by the black star in its center and its respective radius. The ball was thrown against the robot and deviated accordingly. It is easily perceptible that the unfiltered positions are affected by much noise and the path of the ball after the collision is composed of positions that do not make much physical sense. Although we lack the means to externally provide a ground truth for the ball position during its movements, the filtered positions seem to give a much better approximation to the real path taken by the ball, as they provide a path that physically makes more sense. After producing the a priori estimation of the ball position, this estimation is compared with the read measure to detect if the variation between them is too great. If the difference between them is consistently greater than a given threshold (estimated empirically), the filter can indicate that the ball suffered a hard deviation (Fig. 8 illustrates this concept). Although hard deviations are not a serious problem for the filter (as it quickly converges to the new positions), they are used for velocity convergence (as described in the next subsection). 4.2 Ball velocity The calculation of the ball velocity is a feature becoming more and more important over the time. It allows that better decisions can be implemented based on the ball speed value and direction. Assuming the same ball movement model described before, constant ball velocity between cycles and no friction considered, one could theoretically calculate the ball velocity by simple instantaneous velocity of the ball with the first order derivative of each component Δ D Δ T , being ΔD the displacement on consecutive measures and ΔT the time interval between consecutive measures. However, given the noisy environment, it is also predictable that this approach would be greatly affected by that noise and thus its results would not be satisfactory. Fig. 9 shows a ball movement capture where the ball was moving from left to right, as indicated by the arrow in the top of the figure, and was then deviated into a downward movement near the “1st deviation” tag. While moving downward, the ball was deviated again near the “2nd deviation” tag and started to move from right to left. Finally, in the end of the capture, a new deviation occurred near tag “3rd deviation” where the ball started to move upward. The estimated ball positions are represented by the blue dots. Red lines represent the velocity vectors estimated based on consecutive positions displacement. It is clear that the velocity estimates hardly give an acceptable insight of the ball movement. To keep a calculation of the object velocity consistent with its displacement, an implementation of a linear regression algorithm was chosen. This approach based on linear regression [25] is similar to the velocity estimation described in [18]. By keeping a buffer of the last m measures of the object position and sampling instant (in this case buffers of nine samples were used), one can calculate a regression line to fit the positions of the object. Since the object position is composed by two coordinates (x, y), we actually have two linear regression calculations, one for each dimension. This is made in a transparent way, so the description is presented generally, as if only one dimension was considered. When applied over the positions estimation, the linear regression velocity estimations are much more accurate than the instant velocities calculated by Δ D Δ T , and allow a better insight of the ball movement. The same ball movement capture described earlier is represented in Fig. 10 , this time with the velocity vectors estimated by the linear regression applied over the position estimations provided by the Kalman filter. In order to try to make the regression converge more quickly on deviations of the ball path, a reset feature was implemented. This allows deletion of the older values, keeping only the n most recent ones, and provides control of the buffer size. By keeping the most recent values after a hard deviation, we reduce outliers of the previous path, thus promoting faster convergence. This reset results from the interaction with the Kalman filter described earlier by querying it for the existence of a hard deviation on the ball path. The obtained values were tested to confirm if the linear regression of the ball positions was more precise and would converge faster than the internal velocity estimated by the Kalman filter. Tests showed that the velocity estimated by the Kalman filter has a slower response than the linear regression estimation when deviations occur. Given this, the linear regression was used to estimate the velocity because quickness of convergence was preferred over the slightly smoother approximation of the Kalman filter in the steady state. That is because in the game environment the ball is very dynamic, it constantly changes its direction and thus a convergence in less than half the cycles is much preferred. Fig. 11 shows the results for a theoretical velocity scenario where the ball was moving at a constant speed of 2m/s and suddenly dropped to a constant 1m/s speed. Both the speeds estimated by the Kalman filter and the ones estimated by the linear regression are presented. 4.3 Team ball position sharing Due to the highly important role that the ball has in a soccer game, when a robot cannot detect it by its own visual sensors (omni or frontal camera), it may still know the position of the ball, through sharing of that knowledge by the other team mates. The ball data structure includes a field with the number of cycles it was not visible by the robot, meaning that the ball position given by the vision sensors can be the “last seen” position. When the ball is not visible for more than a given number of cycles, the robot assumes that it cannot detect the ball on its own. When that is the case, it uses the information of the ball communicated by the other running team mates to know where the ball is. This can be done by getting the mean and standard deviation of the positions of the ball seen by team mates. Another approach is to simply use the ball position of the team mate that has more confidence in the detection. Independently of the chosen approach, the robot assumes that ball position as correct. When detecting the ball on its own, there is also the need to validate that information. Currently the seen ball is only considered if it is within a given margin inside the field of play as there would be no point in trying to play with a ball outside the field. For ball position sharing, an approach based on the highest confidence ball position is used. This is due to the fact that the shared positions are updated with 100ms periods, with the possibility of a few more milliseconds of unknown and unpredictable delay in packet transmission. Thus, the lifetime of the information of each team mate is different, and the use of the information of the team mate with higher confidence reduces the probability of the degradation of that information during the respective lifetime. Fig. 12 illustrates the general ball integration activity diagram. 5 Obstacle treatment While playing soccer, the robots have the need to navigate around the field effectively, which means they have to reposition themselves or dribble the ball avoiding the obstacles on the field, that can be either team or opponent robots, or eventually the referee. An increasing necessity felt by the team, to improve its performance, is a better obstacle detection and sharing of obstacle information among team mates. This is important to ensure a global idea of the field occupancy, since the team formation usually keeps the robots spread across the field. Pass lines and dribbling corridors can be estimated more easily with a good coverage of field obstacles, allowing improvements on team strategy and coordination. 5.1 Visual obstacle detection The CAMBADA robots gather their information about the surroundings by means of a robotic vision system. Currently, only the omni directional camera gathers information about obstacles, as no frontal camera is being used at this time. According to RoboCup rules, the robots are mainly black. Since during the game robots play autonomously, all obstacles in the field are the robots themselves (occasionally the referee, which is recommended to wear black/dark pants). The vision algorithm detects the obstacles by evaluating blobs of black color inside the field of play [26]. Through the mapping of image positions to real metric positions [27], obstacles are identified by their center (triangle on the processed image, Fig. 13 b) and left and right limits (squares on the processed image, Fig. 13b). This is done by searching black regions on the scanlines of the vision algorithm [23], already referred in Section 3. The detection of black color on the scanlines is analyzed both in angular intervals and length intervals, to define the limits of each black blob (considering their base points which are represented by the first black pixel in each scanline). Since the vision system is a non-SVP hyperbolic catadioptric system [27], the size of objects on the image varies with the distance to the robot. Due to an inverse distance map calculation, by exploring a back-propagation ray-tracing approach and the geometric properties of the mirror surface, the relation of distances in the image and the real world is known. Fig. 14 is an illustration of how the distance in pixels, from the center of the image, is mapped to the distance in meters, on the ground plane. Through the function represented in Fig. 14, it is possible to create a normalized relation of blobs width and length with the distance. Sometimes an obstacle is separated in several blobs, mainly due to the noise in the image and problems in color classification, which leads to failure in the detection of black regions in the scanlines. To avoid these situations, an offset is considered to decide when the angular space between blobs is considered enough to represent a real obstacle separation. The same principle is considered concerning the position of the black area in consecutive scanlines. The separation offsets of a blob close to the robot are bigger than the ones at a high distance, to maintain coherent precision. The angular separation offset is considered for situations where robots are side-by-side, at the same distance, but there is no visual contact between each blob; the length separation offset is checked for situations where, on consecutive scanlines, there are blobs with visual contact but the robots are actually at different distances. Both situations are depicted in Fig. 15 . For each detected blob, their number of pixels is calculated and an estimation of the obstacles left and right limits, as well as their centers, is made. This information is made available to the integration process for filtering and treatment. 5.2 Obstacle selection and identification With the objective of refining the information of the obstacles, and have more meaningful and human readable information, the obstacles are selected and a matching is attempted, in order to try to identify them as team mates or opponents. Due to the weak precision at long distances, a first selection of the obstacles is made by selecting only the obstacles closer than a given distance as available for identification (currently 5m). Also, obstacles that are smaller than 10cm wide or outside the field of play margin are ignored. This is done because the MSL robots are rather big, and in-game situations small obstacles are not present inside the field. Also, it would be pointless to pay attention to obstacles that are outside the field of play, since the surrounding environment is completely ignorable for the game development. To be able to distinguish obstacles, identifying which of them are team mates and which are opponent robots, a fusion between the own visual information of the obstacles and the shared team mates positions is made. By creating a circle around the team mate positions with the robot radius (considered 22cm), a matching of the estimated center of visible obstacle area is made (Fig. 16 ), and the obstacle is identified as the corresponding team mate in case of a positive matching (Figs. 17 c and 18c). This matching consists on the existence of interception points between the team mate circle and the obstacle circle or if the obstacle center is inside the team mate circle (the obstacle circle can be smaller, and thus no interception points would exist). Since the detected obstacles can be large blobs, the above described identification algorithm cannot be applied directly to the visually detected obstacles. If the detected obstacle fulfills the minimum size requisites already described, it is selected as candidate for being a robot obstacle. Its size is evaluated and classified as robot if it does not exceed the maximum size allowed for MSL robots [2] (Fig. 17a and b). If the obstacle exceeds the maximum size of an MSL robot, a division of the obstacle is made, by analyzing its total size which is used to estimate how many robots are in that obstacle. This may be a common situation, robots clashing together and thus creating a compact black blob, originating a big obstacle if they are sufficiently lined up (Fig. 18 a and b). Although the computations for obstacle identification were in use during RoboCup 2009, their results are yet to be considered in the team strategy. Currently, obstacles are always considered unfriendly and thus to be avoided. Due to this fact, there is currently no data of in-game results for this part of the work. Several captures of the obstacle identification algorithm described earlier were performed and analyzed, to further illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The laboratory used for the tests receives natural light which can affect the vision processing algorithms. The presented results are not treated in any way to diminish the effects of natural light, as we are interested in understanding if the algorithms can cope with those conditions which can be found in real situations. In the first test situation, a robot was positioned on the field at (−0.05,1.88) while broadcasting its position. This robot will be referred to as pivot. Another robot was moving on a rectangular path around the pivot, and a capture of its data was done. This robot will be referred to as observer. This scenario is intended to give some insight about the performance of the identification when the team mates are static or nearly static (as is the case of set plays during the games. In these situations it is important to analyze passing lines). Fig. 19 is a graphic representation of the acquired data, with the pivot represented in black. The blue dots are the positions of the path taken by the observer, which covers the rectangular path for three times. In each cycle, the center of the obstacle perceived by the observer is represented by a red ‘×’. It is visible that, as expected, the obstacle position perceived by the observer is not exactly the pivot position. The capture in question is composed of 677 cycles. The identification of the obstacle as the correspondent team mate failed to succeed in only one cycle, which corresponds to a 99.85% success rate. Considering that the pivot has 22cm radius (although it is slightly bigger), the mean of the centers of the perceived obstacle is within the real area occupied by the pivot, at nearly 16cm with a standard deviation of 10cm (Table 1 ). Another test scenario was considered for evaluation of the algorithm performance for moving obstacles. Several captures were performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm when identifying a moving team mate. This set of six captures consisted on a robot observing a team mate moving around and registering the data about the obstacles. The path taken by the moving team mate is represented in Fig. 20 . The number of failed identifications was greater when the moving robot was farther from the observer, as expected due to the noisy nature of the measurements. The captures were performed throughout the day, with different lighting conditions but with the same robot calibration. Table 2 summarizes this set of captures, which revealed a total mean identification ratio of approximately 71%. 5.3 Obstacle sharing With the purpose of improving the global perception of the team robots, the sharing of locally known information is an important feature. Obstacle sharing allows the team robots to have a more global perception of the field occupancy, allowing them to estimate, for instance, passing and dribbling corridors more effectively. However, one has to keep in mind that, mainly due to illumination conditions and eventual reflective materials, some of the detected obstacles may not be exactly robots, but dark shadowy areas. If that is the case, the simple sharing of obstacles would propagate an eventually false obstacle among the team. Thus the algorithm for sharing the obstacles makes a fusion of the several team mates information. The fusion of the information is done mate by mate. After building the worldstate by its own means, the agent checks all the available obstacle information provided by team mates, one by one. Their obstacles are matched with the own ones. If the agent does not know an obstacle shared by the team mate, it keeps it in a temporary list of unconfirmed obstacles. This is done to all the team mates obstacles. When another team mate shares a common obstacle, that same obstacle is confirmed and is transferred to the local list of obstacles. In the current cycle, the temporary obstacles that were not confirmed are not considered. A robot does not use negative information from other robots to remove obstacles it actually saw from its local world model. An outline of the algorithm is presented next. for c:=1 to total_number_of_team_mates for o:=1 to total_obstacles_of_team_mate for m:=1 to total_own_obstacles if m matches o I already know this obstacle, do nothing else if previously known by another team mate obstacle confirmed and added else obstacle considered temporarily waits for confirmation by another team mate endif endif endfor endfor endfor The matching of the team mate obstacles with the own obstacles is done in a way similar to the matching of the obstacle identification with the team mate position described earlier. The CAMBADA team mate position in Fig. 16 is replaced by the current team mate obstacle for the matching test. Fig. 21 shows a situation where robot 2, in the goal area was too far to see the obstacle on the middle of the field. Thus, it considered the obstacle in question, only because it is identified by both robots 5 and 6, as visible in the figure. 6 Conclusion and future work The techniques chosen for information and sensor fusion proved to be effective in accomplishing their objectives. The Kalman filter allows to filter the noise on the ball position and provides an important prediction feature which allows fast detection of deviations of the ball path. The linear regression used to estimate the velocity is also effective, and combined with the deviation detection based on the Kalman filter prediction error, provides a faster way to recalculate the velocity in the new trajectory. The improvement on obstacle treatment allows modifications on the overall team strategy, particularly regarding passing possibilities. It also allows the improvement of the robots movement, since team mate obstacles can have a different treatment than the opponents, because team mates have velocities and other information available. The CAMBADA team obtained the 1st place in the last years of the Portuguese robotics open (Robótica 2007, Robótica 2008, Robótica 2009 and Robótica 2010), and internationally achieved 5th place in RoboCup 2007, 1st place in RoboCup 2008, 3rd place in RoboCup 2009 and 2nd place in GermanOpen 2010. Although the described work proved to be effective and helped to achieve good results, improving is always the aim for this kind of project. Thus, improvements on the localization algorithm are desired, as well as a different way to disambiguate symmetric positions to eventually complement or replace the compass. Another path to follow would be the improving of team strategy based on obstacle identification, creating new forms of cooperation and set plays for in-game situations.

The model relies on the three-base periodicity and provides an estimate of the entropy associated with each of the three bases of the codons. We observe that the three entropy values vary among themselves and also from species to species. Moreover, we provide evidence that this makes it possible to associate a three-state entropy vector with each species, and we show that similar species are characterized by similar three-state entropy vectors. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

        "doc_abstract": "This paper is focused on the sensor and information fusion techniques used by a robotic soccer team. Due to the fact that the sensor information is affected by noise, and taking into account the multi-agent environment, these techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of the robot world model. One of the most important elements of the world model is the robot self-localisation. Here, the team localisation algorithm is presented focusing on the integration of visual and compass information. To improve the ball position and velocity reliability, two different techniques have been developed. A study of the visual sensor noise is presented and, according to this analysis, the resulting noise variation depending on the distance is used to define a Kalman filter for ball position. Moreover, linear regression is used for velocity estimation purposes, both for the ball and the robot. This implementation of linear regression has an adaptive buffer size so that, on hard deviations from the path (detected using the Kalman filter), the regression converges more quickly. A team cooperation method based on sharing of the ball position is presented. Besides the ball, obstacle detection and identification is also an important challenge for cooperation purposes. Detecting the obstacles is ceasing to be enough and identifying which obstacles are team mates and opponents is becoming a need. An approach for this identification is presented, considering the visual information, the known characteristics of the team robots and shared localisation among team members. The same idea of distance dependent noise, studied before, is used to improve this identification. Some of the described work, already implemented before RoboCup2008, improved the team performance, allowing it to achieve the 1st place in the Portuguese robotics open Robótica2008 and in the RoboCup2008 world championship. © 2010 Springer.",

CAMBADA robots carry inherent delays which associated with discrete time control results in non-instant, non-continuous control degrading the performance over time. Besides a natural maximum velocity, CAMBADA robots have also a maximum acceleration limit implemented at software level to provide motion stability as well as current peaks avoidance on DC motors. Considering the previous constraints, such as the cycle time and the overall sensor-action delay, compensations can be made to improve the robot control. Since CAMBADA robots are among the slowest robots in the RoboCup Medium Size League, such compensations can help to improve both several behaviours as well as a better field coverage formation. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",

To build an increasingly better world model, one of the aspects that one should consider is the treatment of obstacles. This paper gives an insight of the general steps necessary for a good obstacle representation in the robot world model. A first step is the visual detection of the obstacles in the image acquired by the robot. This is done using an algorithm based on radial search lines and colour-based blobs detection, where each obstacle is identified and delimited. After having the visually detected obstacles, a fusion with a-priori known information about the obstacles characteristics allows the obstacle separation and filtering, so that obstacles that don't fill the criteria are discarded. With the position information shared by team mates, the matching of the obstacles and the team mates positions is also possible, thus identifying each of them. Finally, and with the purpose of having a team world model as coherent as possible, the robots are able to share the obstacle information of each other. The work presented in this paper was developed for the CAMBADA robotic soccer team. After achieving the 1st place in the Portuguese robotics open Robótica2008 and in the Robocup2008 world championship, the correct treatment of obstacles was one of the new challenges proposed among the team to improve the performance for the next competitions. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",

It has been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the shortest ones. Results: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. Conclusion: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed additional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing studies on the topic. © 2009 Pinho et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
