Even though a considerable amount of patient health information does exist, it is usually distributed and hidden in many institutions. The goal of this project is to provide, for any research community, a holistic view of biomedical datasets of interests, from which researchers can explore several distinct levels of granularity. Methods We developed a community-centered approach to facilitate data sharing while ensuring privacy. A dynamic schema allows exposing any metadata model about existing repositories. The framework was developed following a modular plugin-based architecture that facilitates the integration of internal and external tools. Results The EMIF Catalogue, a web platform for sharing and reusing biomedical data. Through this system, data custodians can publish and share different levels of information, while the researchers can search for databases that fulfill research requirements. Conclusions The EMIF Catalogue currently fosters several distinct research communities, with different levels of data governance, combining, for instance, data available in pan-European EHR and Alzheimer cohorts. This portal is publicly available at https://emif-catalogue.eu. Keywords Biomedical data integration Data discovery Data sharing Data catalogue Research study Data reuse 1 Introduction The continuous digitalization of health care services, together with the increasing diversity of personal biomedical data, have led to an exponential increase in the volume of clinical and disease-specific data that is being gathered daily throughout the world [1]. Consequently, the bottleneck of biomedical research is shifting from data generation to data management and analysis. Disseminating these large, complex data has the potential to push forward clinical research advancements and ultimately improve public health, through the secondary reuse of multiple health care databases [2]. However, the fragmentation of data in terms of geographical location, terminology and consistency limits the efficiency of tracking-down and reusing biomedical records [3]. Another issue is the reduced consistency across databases, i.e. they typically rely on different languages, measurement types, coding schema [4]. In addition, relationships among data items are often defined implicitly, in some supplementary documentation or as experts\u2019 tacit knowledge [5]. To reuse these data for clinical research, several methods for quality assessment and data harmonization need to be adopted [6,7]. As a result, it seems that sometimes it is cheaper, easier or more desirable to create a database afresh rather than adapt it to existing resources [8]. All the aforementioned challenges, which are still in the process of being solved, contribute to the difficulties clinical researchers face when trying to identify datasets or candidate subjects for a specific study. We propose in this paper a solution that addresses them, with the ultimate goal of enabling data discovery and reuse: the EMIF Catalogue 1 1 https://emif-catalogue.eu . The aim of the platform is to take full advantage of existing biomedical data, facilitate knowledge discovery, and make scientific discoveries more productive and reproducible. Data can be shared and exposed with different levels of details, from metadata to summarized views. User profiles guarantee that data owners share as much as they want either with any user or with specific ones. Moreover, patient data can be made available in a controlled, remote research environment upon requests that can be made directly from the catalogue. The platform assists users not only in discovering biomedical databases of interests, but more so in assessing their suitability for a specific clinical or research study and the feasibility of the study. The EMIF Catalogue is constantly evolving with the final goal of building a data network to enforce data interoperability and cross-institution reproducibility of clinical and research studies. This paper is divided into five more sections. Section 2 presents an outline of the most recent developments related to biomedical data discovery and its reuse, and highlights the motivation behind this work. We overview the European Medical Infrastructure Framework initiative in Section 3, while Section 4 focuses on the presentation of the EMIF Catalogue. Finally, Section 5 discusses and assesses the impact of our work within the research community and Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Background Clinical and biomedical information is by nature complex and the exponential growth of gathered biomedical data only contributes to this complexity. The opportunities for the reuse of these data in biomedical research are endless: from the discovery of appropriate subjects in clinical studies, to the reduction of health care costs and procedural errors, and ultimately overall improved and cheaper health care practices [9]. The secondary reuse of citizens\u2019 health data and investigation of the real evidence of therapeutics may lead to the achievement of personalized, predictive and preventive medicine [10]. Currently, researchers need to discover individual repositories and conduct isolated searches among them (Fig. 1 ). These operations are time-consuming and, most importantly, often the user is not able to retrieve the necessary information. A successfully integrated search engine may provide a one-stop shop, where data seekers can quickly access all these resources, improving the community's capacity to utilize existing databases for data query, knowledge dissemination and integrative analysis. Joining together multi-country and multi-center data sources can lead to considerable gains, providing easier access to innovative medicines and improved health outcomes [11]. The field of genomics was a primary driving force behind the generation of what we call today big data in bioinformatics and its consequent harmonization and integration. Among the initiatives that focus on integrating omics data, the Omics Discovery Index [12] aggregates and indexes 90 729 datasets from 15 repositories. The combination of clinical and genomics information of the i2b2 platform [13] permits correlating different data sources and facilitates the design of therapies for patients with genetic diseases. By mining clinical data for cohort discovery and hypothesis generation, i2b2 aims to translate the discoveries of the genomic era into more effective and personalized health care. Among industries, the pharmaceutical industry manages huge repositories of clinical and molecular data. These data are fundamental for drug discovery and require careful assembly, overlay and comparison from various sources. Open PHACTS 2 2 http://www.openphactsfoundation.org is an initiative aimed at reducing barriers in drug discovery in industry, academia and small businesses. Open PHACTS integrates pharmaceutical data from multiple publicly-available databases into a linked data resource, and provides tools and services to interact with that data. Another US initiative, the Sentinel system, was designed to monitor the safety of FDA-regulated medical products [14]. For this purpose, it uses pre-existing electronic health care data from multiple sources. In population health, disease registries and data from clinical records and studies are being used to measure the impact of health interventions, as well as providing researchers with a complete picture of the expression of a given disease. The RD-Connect platform 3 3 http://rd-connect.eu/ is an integrated platform connecting databases, registries, biobanks and clinical bioinformatics for rare disease research [15]. It supports the development of a suite of clinical bioinformatics tools, including data mining and knowledge discovery tools for analysis and integration of molecular and clinical data to discover new disease genes, pathways and therapeutic targets. The global movement toward increased secondary use of care data opens up new perspectives for researchers and clinicians, and raises new technical and ethical questions. SHARPn, a project designed to explore the secondary use of Electronic Health Records (EHR), receives data in several formats, and generates structured and normalized data, allowing data access through phenotype specifications. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) is a family of health care databases and related software tools and products developed through a Federal State industry partnership and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [16]. HCUP includes the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States. Researchers and policy-makers use HCUP data to identify, track, analyze and compare hospital statistics at the national, regional and state levels. Still in the US, the US National Institutes of Health developed BTRIS [17] with the aim of improving current methods for data access and use. The system accommodates any type of data, including hospital departmental systems and central EHRs and it is optimized for the most likely queries to be performed. The user interface allows users to access data in an independent, \u201cself-service\u201d way. In Europe, BioMedBridges [18] key rational is the establishment of dedicated interactions amongst existing ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) infrastructures. Hence, it aims to create an e-infrastructure to allow interoperability between data and services in the biological, medical, translational and clinical domains and thus strengthen biomedical resources in Europe. Similarly, several other software solutions have been developed with the aim of helping scientists gather, annotate and process health data, in more efficient ways. One such example is REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a web-based system designed to allow researchers to define project-specific data capture and launch protocol data collection [19]. The software supports exporting the data to several formats so that it can be analyzed by any common statistics tool. This is a popular solution in the field, despite not being widely open to users and accessible only on request. Similar to RedCap, SciPort is a web-based biomedical data sharing platform that supports data sharing across distributed organizations [3]. Data can be organized into communities, supported by a generic and customizable meta-data model. To enable data sharing, SciPort provides a central server-based data sharing architecture with one-click data sharing from a local server. Semantic consistency is established by the use of semantic tagging through controlled vocabularies. DEDUCE Guided Query Tool [20] is another web-based platform that supports cohort identification and data extraction. The project uses some business intelligence features to allow investigators to access administrative, financial and clinical information generated during patient care, without needing to understand complex query language or the underlying data models. DataMed, an initiative developed through the National Institutes of Health funded biomedical and healthCAre Data Discovery Index Ecosystem (bioCADDIE) consortium [21], integrates biomedical datasets of interest from heterogeneous sources and makes them searchable through a web-based interface. These initiatives allow collaborative research and represent a joint market place for health care and clinical data. They share a common set of goals and through this evaluation we assessed the lessons learned, challenges encountered and potential future collaborations. By summarizing these state-of-the-art approaches, we identified research gaps that led to the definition of our research goal. These solutions represent isolated software tools or projects designed to support specific research, with a clear purpose, but there are still missing platforms to solve challenges such as the creation of multiple-institution research environments, and the promotion of publications and subscription of specific studies or datasets. In the EMIF ecosystem, not only can the EMIF partners take advantage of this framework, but also new projects can join existing communities or create their own. Its underlying aim is to support scientific biomedical research projects. 3 The European Medical Infrastructure Framework Project The EMIF initiative 4 4 www.emif.eu emerged as an effort to address the aforementioned challenges, by focusing on creating a European Medical Information Framework through which large amounts of European biomedical data can be integrated, exploited and reused with the final goal of providing overall better healthcare (Fig. 2 ). The EMIF Catalogue was designed as a portal for all EMIF provided functionalities and incorporates a web interface that links to other relevant components such as a federated query module and a workflow manager, among others. Its main purpose is to facilitate biomedical data exposure and sharing, on one hand, and data discovery and reuse, on the other. This translated into a one-stop platform, which we denominate as a biomedical marketplace, where data custodians can share their data and researchers can easily discover these data to support their clinical studies. At the same time, our vision targeted a fine-grained access control to these biomedical data. For that, we developed a methodology that tackles data privacy from a different perspective to the one exposed by the literature review. In our approach, real data sources are characterized based on a schema that can be easily defined by any data custodian. Multiple data sources that have the same focus can be clustered into an entity, generically denominated as a community. Harmonization within a community arises with the use of the same schema for meta-data characterization of all databases that form it. A user with a specific research question can either identify a community of interest and further explore its databases, or request a new one for this purpose. In this environment, the data custodian controls right upfront in how much detail s/he wants to expose a data source. Several levels of information can be exposed, from summarized views to raw data, accessible in a controlled and possibly remote environment. The access to raw data is possible upon assessing the suitability and the feasibility of a study based on the metadata and summarized views. A secure research environment can be set up with the patient data, upon agreement between data owners and researchers. Moreover, a role-based access control (RBAC) assures that an access policy can be tailored to combine the access constraints with the needs of biomedical researchers. By conjugating these two orthogonal perspectives, we designed an approach to expose biomedical data sources, at different levels of detail, while preserving data privacy (Fig. 3 ). The lessons learned form the literature review have led to identification of the following functional requirements for the development of a usable data discovery and biomedical research portal: \u2022 Data granularity - summarized, aggregated and possibly raw data should be available, under different circumstances and underlying research protocols. \u2022 Data privacy - no private data should be exposed, at any of the granularity levels supported. \u2022 Flexibility - the framework should include a number of tools and user environments catering for different user levels. \u2022 Data diversity - different data sources should be integrated, independently of the data model and physical support. \u2022 Usefulness - data put forward by the catalogue should be filterable and extractable. \u2022 Usability - in brief, the platform should be usable and intuitive for any user category. 4 The EMIF Catalogue EMIF Catalogue is an online platform designed as a marketplace, in which the biomedical database is the main entity that is characterized, typically EHRs or cohort data. Currently, the EMIF Catalogue supports several distinct projects, combining, for instance, data available in pan-European EHR and Alzheimer cohorts (Fig. 4 ). 4.1 Building a community A collection of databases is denominated as a community within the platform that we present. More specifically, a community is a group of databases that share common features, such as the type of data exposed or their purpose. Access to a community is moderated by the community manager and several community types are supported: open - anyone can join, public - visible to any user and with access granted by request and by invitation only. Within a community, data custodians use the same template for extracting and exposing meta-data about their databases. Each of the rectangles in Fig. 4 represents a community hosted in the EMIF Catalogue. Through a dynamic characterization schema, which we denominate as fingerprint, data custodians are given the opportunity to expose their data in a multi-level visibility approach. While the use of vocabularies or ontologies is not enforced, the integration of data coming from dissimilar sources converges towards conceptual harmonization through the use of the same meta data extraction schema. Different databases, such as EHRs, paper records and cohort data can be exposed in a harmonized manner, without interfering with the underlying data models (Fig. 5 ). Each of these data sources will be characterized by the same fields, which, in a more general way, represent answers to the same questions defined in the fingerprint template. By using a common structure as a fingerprint skeleton, distinct data sources converge to homogeneous exposure of their meta-data. 4.2 Describing entities Data owners can submit their datasets by filling in the fingerprint template, whose structure is designed by the community owner, as simply as filling in a spreadsheet. The fingerprint template consists of question sets regarding the data that each dataset contains. The collection of answers to the questions in each question set provides a general view on the real data, without disclosing any private information contained in it. This approach allows the aggregation and further exposure of meta-data of clinical datasets at a level of detail that is currently not present in any other health care related platform (Fig. 6 ). Flexibility was identified as a requirement of the system and has been put into practice in the way that a fingerprint can be easily extended and updated, using a vast number of standardized fields that can be combined in multiple ways. Each community can implement its own governance rules to which each data custodian will have to agree before sharing any data. Additionally, each public release of a fingerprint can be accompanied by a disclaimer, personalized for the database in question. In the current use of the EMIF Catalogue, community managers - which are usually designated among owners of databases within a community - define a common set of either questions, fields or measurements that define the data within that community. These definitions are created in the form of a spreadsheet, following some simple definition rules. An example of such rules is shown in Fig. 7 . The spreadsheet is uploaded onto the system and the result for the owner end-user is the translation of these definitions into buttons, input fields, publication items and location selects, among others. This eases the process of gathering and exposing meta-data of a given database. The view inside the community is rendered in Figure 8 , with an example of a community that clusters Alzheimer Disease related databases. 4.3 Searching for data/Discovering data EMIF Catalogue yields two distinct search mechanisms. Regular users are able to search over databases, within a community. A simple search will retrieve all databases in which a given search string is identified. To support the search backend, we rely on a Solr 5 5 http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ search engine [22]. A retrieval model is considered for scoring, sorting and improving the quality of results. The following sources of information are integrated: \u2022 Text of the questions or categories of the schema template. \u2022 Meta-data content. \u2022 Medline publications uploaded in the Catalogue and associated to a database. \u2022 Other files uploaded in the system and associated to a database. \u2022 Attribute-Value Pairs of meta-data uploaded by means of the web-services API. This means that when a search is performed, not only the meta-data is analyzed, but also all its associated information. The same back-office is used to give suggestions in the free text search, a feature supported by another Solr core. The advanced search, depicted in Fig. 9 extends the simple search by providing the possibility of building boolean queries, based on the fields included in the database fingerprint. Advanced Search allows filtering the search for specific fields. For instance, databases can be queried for \u201ca specific location, with a specific codification about pediatrics\u201d. Two Boolean operators are supported, AND and OR, along with a nesting feature that allows tree-like queries. In the Advanced Boolean Search concepts can be dragged within the search area, combined with the two boolean operators or collapsed within other concepts. The Advance Boolean Search is an important tool for the discovery of databases of interest, as it allows a higher granularity and refinement of the search criteria. Moreover, the user has the possibility to save queries within its profile and reuse them or eventually refine them at a later time. Considering that the majority of users are also database submitters, researchers must be able to find databases similar to their own. This led to the definition of relatedness metrics that can retrieve specific property matches, such as location proximity (Fig. 10 ). This feature allows the comparison of up to 3 items simultaneously, side by side. If a bigger number of items are to be compared, they can be pre-selected and switched in the interface. The reference database can be changed at any time as well. For each of the fields defined in the schema template, the comparison feature will highlight similarities and discrepancies, in different colors, for the databases chosen to be compared. Further refinement of databases of interest can be achieved through the custom views feature. This allows users to select specific questions or complete questionsets for specific databases and returns, in a tabular view, the answers to those questions within the chosen databases (Fig. 11 ). 4.4 Exploring analytical tools The platform supports the integration of third-party components, through which its functionalities can be extended without having to deal with its base code. To accomplish this strategy, a microkernel architecture is in place, to which several components can be dynamically added. These third-party components can be added either at a community level or, ultimately, at the Catalogue level, which means they are available within all the communities. Users that are granted the necessary permissions can develop and live-preview their plugin versions during development. Upon submission to the system, these plugins have to be validated either by the community manager or the system administrator. One such component was integrated in the Catalogue due to the wide adoption of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) and the need to extract the aggregated data from these data sources. Achilles 6 6 http://www.ohdsi.org/web/achilles/ is a module able to extract population characteristics. Although this tool already allowed visualization of the data, it was mainly focused on the information that is stored in a folder. Hence, we developed several contributions to this open source project to permit data representation from any web endpoint. This module was integrated in the Catalogue, as a database plugin (Fig. 12 )). Among other useful plugins, TASKA 7 7 https://emif-catalogue.eu/taska is a workflow management system where users can create workflow templates which can be reused by distinct groups and for different purposes. TASKA was integrated within the EMIF Catalogue as a need to have an integrated tool to manage all the different tasks that are involved in a research study. Another plugin that was integrated derived from the wide adoption by data custodians of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) 8 8 https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/ . ATLAS 9 9 http://www.ohdsi.org/web/atlas is the open-source web application used to conduct scientific analyses on standardized observational data converted to the OMOP CDM. This analytic tool allows the generation and execution of scripts with cohort definitions, which significantly simplifies data custodians\u2019 work when asked to query their databases. CodeMapper 10 10 https://euadr.erasmusmc.nl/CodeMapper/ assists in the creation of code sets from case definitions, for several coding systems simultaneously while keeping a record of the complete mapping process. Fig. 13 shows the integration of these tools within the EMIF Catalogue. A methodology based on the use of TASKA and ATLAS for performing semi-automated queries over geographically distributed biomedical databases [23] is in place within the EMIF Catalogue. It relies on the use of user profiles and user-tailored permissions and it allows data custodians to maintain full control of their data. This approach is directly related to data reuse and is presented with more detail next. 4.5 Conducting studies - reusing data We have already described the pipeline that allows a researcher to identify one or several databases of interest. Considering the scenario of conducting research or a clinical study over the identified database(s), the EMIF Catalogue makes available a Study Request form. This is a plugin at the community level through which regular users of the platform can fill in and submit a research question or even a more advanced study request. The form allows the choice of databases to which the study applies or refers to (Fig. 14 ). Given the practical scenario of a study focused on understanding the natural history of Chronic Venous Disease, a first query aimed at assessing the feasibility steps of the study was submitted to one of the communities of the Catalogue. The submitting researcher was interested in finding counts of patients corresponding to ICD10 or READ codes listed in the request. The mechanism for user roles and permissions that is integrated in the Catalogue forwards the study request to users denominated as Study Managers within the system. Study Managers are in charge of orchestrating the workflow that will lead to an answer to this request. In other words, Study Managers handle the requests and closely collaborate with data custodians that own the database(s) of interest in order to provide an answer to the request. These requests, as well as the interactions between data custodians and study managers, are regularly managed through TASKA, the workflow manager directly accessible from the Catalogue. ATLAS comes in handy for the data custodians involved in the study request, who can locally query their databases and export some results. Finally, the researcher can import these results in the ATLAS installation of the Catalogue and interpret them within the purpose of the study. Alternatively, following given protocols, the researcher can be granted access to the raw data in a remote controlled environment [23]. The private remote research environment provides a solid solution for users to manage sensible data in a secure workspace. It consists of a secure cloud server that can be used to support the several uses case of EMIF up to the project completion. 4.6 Software technologies To address the technical and functional requirements that were identified from the analysis of current challenges in the integration of biomedical data, we created an architecture for a marketplace platform that satisfies the research needs of both data custodians and clinical researchers. Within the EMIF Catalogue, communities of databases uncover meta-data as a first level of data exposure. These meta-data are extracted through a fingerprint schema, as previously detailed and presented to the end user through a user-friendly interface. At a second level, aggregated information about these meta-data can be presented through dashboards that are integrated as external components. At a higher level, patient data can be made available for querying in a controlled remote environment, supported by the platform. Furthermore, each of these steps involved in the discovery and reuse of biomedical data can be managed through a workflow management system directly accessible from the catalogue. The EMIF Catalogue was backed by MONTRA [22]. This framework is an Agile architecture for data publishing and discovery, written in Python 11 11 www.python.org , using Django 12 12 https://www.djangoproject.com/ , a framework that encourages rapid development and clean programmatic design. To complement this, a considerable part of the development was made in HTML5 13 13 https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ , CSS 14 14 https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ and JavaScript 15 15 https://www.javascript.com/ , namely the interface and the end-user interaction. 5 Discussion Numerous solutions for discovering, integrating or querying biomedical data sources have already been presented in the literature. However, each of these solutions only addressed particular aspects of the biomedical data integration and reuse problem. Translational research was still in need of a complete framework, to allow discovery and reuse of any type of biomedical data, while preserving data privacy. The EMIF Catalogue came as an attempt to address that need and its continuous use within the biomedical community validates its impact [24\u201326]. The catalogue has been successfully used for building a european medical information framework for Alzheimer's disease, as well as for the identification and comparison of child health systems across Europe. Other recent European initiatives concerned with extracting insights from clinical big data have started using the EMIF Catalogue in order to assemble data and facilitate their discovery. As such, BigData@Heart 16 16 https://www.bigdata-heart.eu/ an EU public-private consortium consisting of patient networks, academia and pharmaceutical companies works toward building a big data-driven translational research platform. The community fostered in the EMIF Catalogue joins clinical metadata of atrial fibrillation, heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. The PIONEER initiative 17 17 https://prostate-pioneer.eu/ brings together private and public stakeholders, in prostate cancer research and clinical care from across 9 countries. This project is another example of recent initiatives that take advantage of the functionalities of the EMIF Catalogue. The newly created PIONEER community within the catalogue aims at combining and analysing patient records of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Building the EMIF Catalogue was an interactive process, in which both EMIF partners and regular users have been involved (Fig. 15 ). A repetitive cycle of software development followed by internal testing and validation leads to the deployment of stable versions of the catalogue. These versions are regularly updated either with new features or improvements suggested by the users\u2019 community. Regular users of the platform can become involved in the process by submitting feedback directly through the catalogue, using a form specifically designed for this purpose. In order to take advantage of data and enforce data (re)use and interoperability, the FAIR principles have been followed and put into practice [27]. The number of registered users of the Catalogue has continuously grown, since its public release in January 2017. Until then the Catalogue had been used mostly internally, by the EMIF partners. In January 2017 a stronger dissemination strategy was adopted, which led to growth both in number of accesses and users. The EMIF Catalogue fosters, as of July 2018, nine distinct communities, with different levels of disclosure. Throughout these communities, a total number of 410 databases are shared and explored by more than 850 distinct registered users of the platform. 6 Conclusions This paper presented an integrated, efficient Information Framework for consistent re-use and exploitation of available biomedical data, designed to support new research. The EMIF Catalogue supports data discovery, data evaluation and data (re)use and already integrates a set of tools allowing any researcher not only to identify databases of interest, but also to reuse these data for clinical studies. By developing this platform we intended to address, from a different perspective, some of the challenges faced by biomedical data discovery and interoperability. We created a marketplace to attend to the needs of both data custodians and data researchers, while making sure that no data privacy is disclosed at any time during the sharing and reuse of the data. The EMIF Catalogue is being widely used by several European initiative concerned with extracting knowledge from big volumes of biomedical data, as well as impacting translational research and providing overall better healthcare. Summary Points \u2022 With the increasing use of EHR data the bottleneck of biomedical research is shifting from data generation to data management and analysis. \u2022 The fragmentation of data in terms of geographical location, terminology and consistency limits the efficiency of tracking-down and reusing biomedical records. \u2022 Disseminating these large, complex data has the potential to push forward clinical research advancements and ultimately improve public health, through the secondary reuse of multiple health care databases. \u2022 The aim of the EMIF Catalogue is to take full advantage of existing biomedical data, facilitate knowledge discovery, and make scientific discoveries more productive and reproducible. \u2022 Data can be shared and exposed with different levels of details, from metadata to summarized views. \u2022 User profiles guarantee that data owners share as much as they want either with any user or with specific ones. Moreover, patient data can be made available in a controlled, remote research environment upon requests that can be made directly from the catalogue. \u2022 The platform assists users not only in discovering biomedical databases of interests, but more so in assessing their suitability for a specific clinical or research study and the feasibility of the study.

Even though a considerable amount of patient health information does exist, it is usually distributed and hidden in many institutions. The goal of this project is to provide, for any research community, a holistic view of biomedical datasets of interests, from which researchers can explore several distinct levels of granularity. Methods We developed a community-centered approach to facilitate data sharing while ensuring privacy. A dynamic schema allows exposing any metadata model about existing repositories. The framework was developed following a modular plugin-based architecture that facilitates the integration of internal and external tools. Results The EMIF Catalogue, a web platform for sharing and reusing biomedical data. Through this system, data custodians can publish and share different levels of information, while the researchers can search for databases that fulfill research requirements. Conclusions The EMIF Catalogue currently fosters several distinct research communities, with different levels of data governance, combining, for instance, data available in pan-European EHR and Alzheimer cohorts.
