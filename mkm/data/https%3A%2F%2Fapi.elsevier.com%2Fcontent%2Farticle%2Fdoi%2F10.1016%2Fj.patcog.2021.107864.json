Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro University of Aveiro Portugal The artistic community is increasingly relying on automatic computational analysis for authentication and classification of artistic paintings. In this paper, we identify hidden patterns and relationships present in artistic paintings by analysing their complexity, a measure that quantifies the sum of characteristics of an object. Specifically, we apply Normalized Compression (NC) and the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) to a dataset of 4,266 paintings from 91 authors and examine the potential of these information-based measures as descriptors of artistic paintings. Both measures consistently described the equivalent types of paintings, authors, and artistic movements. Moreover, combining the NC with a measure of the roughness of the paintings creates an efficient stylistic descriptor. Furthermore, by quantifying the local information of each painting, we define a fingerprint that describes critical information regarding the artists\u2019 style, their artistic influences, and shared techniques. More fundamentally, this information describes how each author typically composes and distributes the elements across the canvas and, therefore, how their work is perceived. Finally, we demonstrate that regional complexity and two-point height difference correlation function are useful auxiliary features that improve current methodologies in style and author classification of artistic paintings. The whole study is supported by an extensive website (http://panther.web.ua.pt) for fast author characterization and authentication. Keywords Image analysis Data compression BDM Artistic paintings Algorithmic information theory 1 Introduction Artistic paintings are concrete visual expressions of human evolution and creativity to share emotions, values, visions, beliefs, and trends of history and culture. The creation, interpretation, and analysis of artistic paintings are social, contextual, subjective, passive, and, beyond superficial characteristics, complex to compute and automatize [1]. In particular, it is theorized that art is an output of social agents, particularly a human experience, that can only be imitated by machines [2]. One of the non-trivial characteristic analysis of artistic paintings is related to the process of measuring the information contained in those paintings. Artistic paintings contain information related to schools, periods, and artists [3]. The artistic community widely uses automatic computational analysis of artistic paintings for authentication of artistic paintings [4,5]. Currently, this process does not substitute human experts completely; however, it is an essential additional control for fraud and mislead detections [6]. Furthermore, applying new techniques and pre-existing ones that are new to the field, can be useful not only for authorship attribution and fraud detection but also for art style categorization and organization, and even for art content explanation. In this paper, we introduce novel solutions for automatic computational analysis of artistic paintings and for the problem of artist authentication. When addressing artist authentication, several questions arise: What defines a painter\u2019s style? How does the author expose information? How does the author differs and relates to other artists? Furthermore, taking inspiration from information theory: How do we best quantify information in a painting? How is the information utilized across the canvas? Moreover, what can information quantification tell us about the author\u2019s style, way of painting, and relationships with other authors? These complex questions are at the core of this paper\u2019s development, where we describe and compare solutions for unsupervised measures of probabilistic and algorithmic information in images (2D) of artistic paintings. Our contributions are as follows: \u2022 We perform a direct comparison between state-of-the-art unsupervised probabilistic and algorithmic information measures to specify each measure\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. \u2022 We show that hidden patterns and relationships present in artistic paintings can be identified by analysing their complexity. \u2022 We show an efficient stylistic descriptor by combining the Normalized Compression and a measure of the paintings\u2019 roughness. \u2022 We propose a new descriptor of the artists\u2019 style, artistic influences, and shared techniques. \u2022 We show that average local complexity describes how each author typically composes and distributes the elements across the canvas and, therefore, how their work is perceived. \u2022 We demonstrate that these measures can serve as useful auxiliary features capable of improving current methodologies in the classification of artistic paintings. To explain how we achieve this, we first compare the Normalized Compression (NC), employing a data compression tool chosen after a competitive benchmark, with the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) [7], and the inherent Coding Theorem Method (CTM) measures [8,9]. The BDM is an information-based measure that uses small Turing machines to approximate the algorithmic information, approximating to the Shannon entropy as a fallback mechanism. After this comparison, we make use of the average NC of each artist together with the roughness exponent \u03b1 of the two-point height difference correlation function (HDC), to group artists by style. Furthermore, we provide a local complexity matrix that characterizes each artist using the NC and use it to construct a phylogenetic tree that portraits the relationship between artists in terms of exposing information to the observer. Finally, we use the regional complexity fingerprints and the roughness exponent \u03b1 as useful auxiliary features that, combined with state-of-the-art approaches, improve the results of style and artist classification tasks. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe related work, followed by a description of the methods. We present the major results in the next section, with further results presented in Supplementary Material. Finally, we discuss the results obtained, draw final conclusions, and point out possible future lines of work. 2 Related work Measuring the information contained in paintings requires fast, efficient, and automatic computation due to the diversity and large quantity of the existing artistic paintings [10]. To measure the information (or complexity) contained in paintings, we first need to define what is the quantity of information of an image. We define the quantity of information of an image as the smallest number of bits required by a model to represent an image losslessly. To perform this task, the model searches for unknown patterns of similarity between sub-regions of the image [11\u201313] and uses this information to create this compressed representation of the image, relying exclusively in the patterns of the two-dimensional pixels without using exogenous information. There are several approaches to quantify the amount of information. Kolmogorov described three, namely combinatorial [14\u201316], probabilistic [17], and algorithmic [18]. Independently, the works of Solomonoff [19,20] and Chaitin [21] addressed the same lines. While the Kolmogorov complexity is non-computable, it can be approximated with programs for such purpose, such as data compressors, using probabilistic and algorithmic schemes. Practical applications to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity for multiple dimensional digital objects have been developed using Turing machines [7,9,22,23] and data compressors [24\u201329]. Recently, Zenil et al. have shown that this methodology has a closer connection to algorithmic information than other measures based on statistical regularities [7], namely fast lossless compression methods, for sources that follow algorithmic schemes. The majority of the lossless compression algorithms are limited to finding simple statistical regularities as they have been designed for fast storage reduction [30,31]; accordingly, they provide slight improvements over the Shannon entropy [17]. However, there are several which are designed for efficient compression at the expense of more computational resources. For example, lossless compression algorithms, such as GeCo [32], are hybrids between probabilistic and algorithmic schemes. Besides having several context models of different orders, GeCo uses sub-programs that allow substitution [33] and reverse complement modeling [34]. These last two are sub-programs of probabilistic and algorithmic information nature. Another example is PAQ8 [35], a general-purpose compressor that combines multiple context models using a neural network, transform functions, secondary structure predictors, and other simple sub-programs. Usually, the problem is how to find fast and efficient algorithmic models for data compression. Lossless data compressors are tightly related to the concept of minimal description length [36] and algorithmic probability [25,37,38]. Therefore, representative algorithms can be efficiently embedded in these data compressors, including small Turing machines. The idea of automatic computational analysis of artistic paintings is mature [4,5], and the artistic community has widely relied on it for authentication of artistic paintings. Specifically, the characteristics of artistic paintings have been analysed through several statistical techniques and properties, namely fractal [39], wavelet-based [4], hidden Markov models [40,41], Fisher kernel based [42], sparse coding model [43,44], color and brightness [5], illumination [45], stroke [46,47], Print Index [48], and entropy-based analysis [49,50]. Recently, the work of Machado and Lopes [50], using fractional calculus, showed the potentiality of measures based on entropy to describe hierarchical clustering of paintings and their correlation with artistic movements. Regarding style and author classification, several recent works have proposed the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A straightforward approach is to combine features extracted from multiple CNN layers, such as proposed by Peng et al. [51]. Another more effective approach is based on representing images by the principal components of a Gram matrix that captures correlations across the different feature maps obtained from a convolutional layer of a pretrained deep CNN, such as VGG16 or VGG19. Mao et al. [52] combine this representation with the features from all the five convolutional blocks of the VGG16, learning a joint representation that can simultaneously capture content and style of visual arts. On the other hand, Chu et al. [53] apply a support vector machine (SVM) to the Gram representation to perform author and style classification. Then, they improve the results by automatically learning correlations between feature maps. 3 Methods In this section, we describe the measures used, their normalizations, the methodology, and the compression benchmark performed. 3.1 Information-based measures Algorithmic information [18\u201321] differs from a perspective of pure probabilistic information [17] because it considers that the source, rather than generating symbols from a probabilistic ergodic function, creates structures that represent algorithmic schemes [54,55]. Therefore, to reverse the problem, there is the need to identify the program(s) and parameter(s) that generate the outcome(s) [18,21,38]. However, the algorithmic information, K ( x ) , is non-computable [56], mostly because of the halting problem [57]. Therefore, we have to rely on approximations. Namely, in this subsection, we describe the Normalized Compression and two BDM normalizations. Then, we establish the local application of the Normalized Compression to create a complexity matrix for each author and the methods used to create a distance matrix and the phylogenetic tree. Finally, we describe a non-information-based measure, the two-point height difference correlation function. 3.1.1 Normalized compression (NC) An efficient compressor, C ( x ) , gives a possible approximation for the Kolmogorov complexity ( K ( x ) ), where K ( x ) < C ( x ) \u2264 | x | ( | x | is the length of string x in the appropriate scale). Usually, an efficient data compressor is a program that approximates both probabilistic and algorithmic sources using affordable computational resources (Time and RAM). Although the algorithmic nature may be more complex to model, data compressors may have embedded sub-programs to handle this nature. For a definition of safe approximation, see [58]. The normalized version, known as the Normalized Compression (NC), is defined by (1) NC ( x ) = C ( x ) | x | log 2 | A | = C ( x ) | x | , where x is a string, C ( x ) is the compressed size of x in bits, | A | the number of different elements in x (size of the alphabet) and | x | the length of x . Since we consider a binary matrix of each image, | A | = 2 , log 2 2 = 1 . Given the normalization, the NC enables to compare the information contained in the strings independently from their sizes [29]. If the compressor is efficient, then the compressor can approximate the quantity of probabilistic-algorithmic information in data using affordable computational resources. 3.1.2 Normalized block decomposition method (NBDM) Another possible approximation to the Kolmogorov complexity is given by the use of small Turing machines, where these small computer programs approximate the components of a broader representation. The Coding Theorem Method uses the algorithmic probability between a string\u2019s production frequency from a random program and its algorithmic complexity. As such, the more frequent a string is, the lower Kolmogorov complexity it has; and strings of lower frequency have higher Kolmogorov complexity. The Block Decomposition Method (BDM) extends the power of a CTM, approximating local estimations of algorithmic information based on Solomonoff-Levin\u2019s algorithmic probability theory. In practice, it approximates the algorithmic information and, when it loses accuracy, it approximates the Shannon entropy. Since in this article we intend to perform a direct comparison of both measures, we first considered the normalization of the BDM (NBDM 1 ), given by the number of elements (length) of the digital object as (2) NBDM 1 ( x ) = B D M ( x ) | x | log 2 | A | = B D M ( x ) | x | . However, the normalization of the BDM is usually performed using a minimum complexity object (BDM M i n ) and a maximum complexity object (BDM M a x ). A minimum complexity object is filled with only one symbol, like a binary string of only zeros. In contrast, a maximum complexity object is an object that, when decomposed (by a given decomposition algorithm), yields slices that cover the highest CTM values and are repeated only after all possible slices of a given shape have been used once. Using these two objects, the NBDM 2 for a given string can be computed as (3) NBDM 2 ( x ) = B D M ( x ) \u2212 B D M M i n B D M M a x \u2212 B D M M i n , where B D M ( x ) is the BDM value of that string, B D M M i n is the minimum complexity object, and B D M M a x is the maximum complexity object. Kolmogorov complexity is invariant only up to a constant factor, which depends on the choice of a description language K = K \u2032 + L , where K is the total complexity, K \u2032 is the description of the object and L is the description of the language. As such, by performing the normalization according to Eq. (3), the normalization is aiming to remove the constant factor as (4) K \u2212 K M i n K M a x \u2212 K M i n = K \u2032 + L \u2212 K M i n \u2032 \u2212 L K M a x \u2032 + L \u2212 K M i n \u2032 \u2212 L = K \u2032 \u2212 K M i n \u2032 K M a x \u2032 \u2212 K M i n \u2032 , where K M a x and K M i n are the maximum and minimum Kolmogorov complexity objects and K M a x \u2032 and K M i n \u2032 are the maximum and minimum Kolmogorov complexity description of the objects. In this article, we perform a direct comparison between the NC and the NBDM 1 . Furthermore, we compare the two types of BDM normalization and their impact on the results. 3.1.3 Local complexity analysis using the normalized compression The Normalized Compression (NC) was used to approximate the local (or regional) complexity of images of artistic paintings. To that end, all of the dataset images were divided into 16 \u00d7 16 blocks (256 equal regions) and the NC was computed for each block, generating a complexity matrix. Other patch sizes were also tested, specifically patch sizes of 8 \u00d7 8 and 32 \u00d7 32 blocks. Following this operation, the average complexity matrix was generated for each author, using the complexity matrices of their paintings. The average complexity matrices were then used to obtain a similarity matrix, in which the distance between matrices was determined as (5) d ( A , B ) = \u2211 i = 0 n \u2211 j = 0 n \u2223 a i j \u2212 b i j \u2223 , where d is the distance between the complexity matrix A and B , and a i j and b i j are the complexity values at the index i and j of matrices A and B , respectively. Subsequently, using the similarity matrix, a phylogenetic tree was computed recurring to two methods, namely UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) [59] and the Kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm [60], in order to portrait complexity relationships among different authors. 3.2 Two-point height difference correlation function The two-point height difference correlation (HDC) function was computed to quantify brightness contrast as (6) HDC ( r ) = [ h ( x \u2192 + r \u2192 ) \u2212 h ( x \u2192 ) ] 2 \u00af = 1 N r \u2211 x \u2192 , | r \u2192 | = r [ h ( x \u2192 + r \u2192 ) \u2212 h ( x \u2192 ) ] 2 , where the r is the distance between two-pixel points, over-bar represents the spatial average at a fixed distance r for all possible points; N r is the number of possible pairs at a distance r , h ( x ) is pixel intensity at the position x . Using the HDC function, its roughness exponent \u03b1 was determined as (7) \u03b1 = log 10 ( H D C ( r f i n a l ) ) \u2212 log 10 ( H D C ( r i n i t i a l ) ) log 10 ( r f i n a l ) \u2212 log 10 ( r i n i t i a l ) , where ( \u03b1 ) is the slope of the HDC curve in a double logarithmic plot of the surface growth model. The slope was calculated from r i n i t i a l = 10 to r f i n a l , which matches the point where the HDC function saturates, approximately 30% of the image\u2019s width. 3.2.1 Assessment pipeline In order to fairly evaluate the information-based measures, we designed a pipeline for processing images. It respects the following steps: Obtaining the dataset images; converting the images to PGM format; quantization of the images to 8 bits (256 levels) using the Lloyd-Max algorithm; binarization of the images (conversion to 01 format in ASCII) and finally, applying the information-based measurements (NC, NBDM 1 and NBDM 2 ). Quantization was performed using the Lloyd-Max algorithm [61,62] since reducing the precision of the pixels (alphabet) in images enables the filtering of small variations that might occur during the digitalization process. Binarization to 01 format in ASCII was performed since the BDM currently only supports a small alphabet. 3.2.2 Finding an effective data compressor To compute the NC, we have to find an effective data compressor, meaning, a compressor that best represents each image, while using reasonable resources. Since our aim is later to apply this measure to a dataset of artistic painting, we compared seven compression tools, namely GZIP [63], BZIP2 [64], XZ [65], LZMA [66], AC [67], PPMD [68], and PAQ8 [35]. As depicted in Fig. 1 , the PAQ8 tool shows the best compression ratio for this dataset. In fact, it shows an improvement of \u2248 26 % to the second best tool (XZ). The disadvantage is the use of higher RAM and substantially more computational time. Nevertheless, since our purpose is to find the number of bits of a shortest program to reproduce the image, it is affordable to spend these computational resources. Therefore, we used the PAQ8 tool to compress each of the quantized images. The code was compiled using the package provided from Buchner [69]. The PAQ8 version used was kx v7. PAQ8kx v7 is an archiver that achieves the highest compression rates at the expense of speed and memory (approximately 1,6 GB of RAM for this dataset). We used the mode that usually provides the highest compression ratio (command parameter: \u201c-8\u201d). The PAQ8 compressor uses a context mixing algorithm between a large number of models independently predicting each quantized pixel\u2019s next bit [70]. The predictions are combined using a neural network and arithmetic coding [71,72]. For automatic installation, use the script Install.sh, while for more information of PAQ, see the work of Knoll and Freitas [73]. The computations ran in a single core Ubuntu Linux computer running at 2.13 GHz with 1.6 GB of RAM. Using this machine, the compression of the whole dataset with PAQ8 required approximately 270 h of real-time, without parallelization. 4 Results 4.1 Comparison of NC and BDM In order to compare NC with BDM, we performed three types of tests. Namely, we compared the robustness of both measures according to increasing rates of random pixel changes in paintings, tested their application on different types of images, and made an assessment of the minimal information bounds. In the first test, we assessed the impact of an increasing rate of pixel editions using a pseudo-random uniform distribution and compared both information-based measures. This approach is not identical to image noise, but rather a pure edition of pixels. For the purpose, for each of the three authors (Theodore Gericault, Marc Chagall, and Rene Magritte) we select a painting, making 50 adulterated copies of each painting with increasing edition rate (from 1 to 50%). Finally, we measured the NC (Eq. (1)), the NBDM 1 (Eq. (2)), and NBDM 2 (Eq. (3)) in all the paintings. Fig. 2 (A) depicts the values obtained for the NC and BDM. The results show that, when using the same type of normalization, NC is more robust to the increment of pixel edition than NBDM (NBDM 1 ). On the other hand, whereas NBDM 1 considers the normalization by the length of the input object, NBDM 2 performs a normalization that aims to mimic the removal of the constant factor related to Kolmogorov complexity (see Eq. (4)). Since the NBDM 2 normalization does not take into account the constant of the description language, it shows a more robust behavior than NBDM 1 , which increases rapidly with the increase of pixel edition. Since NC and NBDM 1 have the same type of normalization, we will focus on comparing these normalizations from now on. In the second test, we applied both measures to six datasets with distinct nature (9 images each) to understand how NBDM 1 and NC behave with different types of images. The six datasets were: artistic images from 2 different datasets [3,74]; cellular automata images; diabetic retinopathy images [75]; chest computed radiography (CR) images [76] and photographic images [77]. The results are depicted in Fig. 2(B). Overall, the majority of the datasets show similar behavior regarding the NC and NBDM 1 . The exceptions to this are the CR and cellular automata datasets, which exhibit a more algorithmic behavior. The latter dataset is constituted by images created with small programs with simple rules. Whereas the compressor has difficulty compressing this type of images, the BDM can point to their algorithmic nature, and, thus attribute them with minimal value. This outcome shows the importance of the BDM in the detection of simple algorithmic outputs embedded into data. In the last test, we selected one of the most complex images identified by the NBDM in the last subsection to test if the BDM could accommodate specific data alterations. This test is depicted in Fig. 2 (C). After the binarization process, we performed a super-sample image transformation where each char was amplified to a 4 \u00d7 4 representation. This value was selected since the BDM has the default block size value of 4 \u00d7 4 in 2D structures. After this operation, the BDM was computed for the original and the super-sampled image. While the original image was measured with 370981 bits, the super-sampled image had only 79 bits. This abrupt decrease in the complexity value indicates that the BDM underestimates the amount of information contained in the object. The BDM analyses object information in blocks instead of looking at the whole object. Specifically, blocks analysed by the BDM (default block size value of 4 \u00d7 4 in 2D structures) have the same size as the super-sample image transformation (each char was amplified to a 4 \u00d7 4 representation); therefore, the complexity attributed to each block is approximately zero (since each block is composed of all zeros or ones), and hence the overall value attributed to the complexity of the object will drop dramatically. This analysis shows that BDM is not prepared to deal with the information associated with the choice of the model, unlike the NC. The NC relies on the use of a lossless data compressor, bounded by a maximum information channel capacity. From these three tests, we are able to notice some advantages and limitations of both measures. Ranking these measures is not a fair task because they have different characteristics and nature. Therefore, in the remainder of the article, we use the NC and NBDM in a combined mode to recover insights and characteristics from the images of the artistic paintings. 4.2 Information-based measures in images of artistic paintings Herein, we investigate the use of information measures to analyse a dataset of artistic paintings. This dataset [3] contains 4,266 images of artistic paintings from 91 authors, with approximate geometric sizes. The 91 authors are well-known painters, such as Claude Monet, Frida Kahlo, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Picasso, Rembrandt, and Salvador Dali. In the following subsections, we present the results of applying the measures, combining the NC with the HDC function, measuring local complexity for different authors and constructing a phylogenetic tree, as well as using these features to improve style and artist classification. We also measure the impact of normalizing these images by performing image normalization and then applying the measures mentioned above in the dataset. Afterwards, we compared the average variation difference and the percentage difference between the results obtained for each author. The results are shown in the Supplementary Material in Section A.1. 4.2.1 Global measures analysis In this subsection, we measure an approximation to the Kolmogorov complexity for the dataset of artistic paintings. The same pipeline, described in the methods section, was used, with the difference that the Lloyd-Max algorithm quantization was set to 16, 64, and 256 levels (4, 6, and 8 bits respectively). Important to note that Lloyd-Max algorithm forced normalization of the images for the 16 and 64 levels, while the 256 level was the original level of the images, and, as such, these images were not normalized. This process was performed to evaluate the impact of the quantization on the measures used to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity in artistic painting images. From the results obtained from the measures, we show unknown characteristics and insights into temporal traits. In general, the complexity of each painting follows the example of Fig. 3 . Paintings with low complexity are classified as abstract and minimalist, following simple patterns. As the complexity increases, we start to recognize paintings with different local complexities, meaning, there are regions with high complexity and detail (generally on the center/bottom of the paintings) surrounded by low complexity regions (same color background) namely known as chiaroscuro. This pattern begins fading, as the complexity increases since the highest complexity paintings are also the most irregular, detailed, and convoluted. Regarding the average complexity values for each artist, Fig. 4 shows the average of NBDM 1 and NC, respectively. Each artist has an associated color, and lines of the same color illustrate its relative positional deviation in different quantizations. The same results for NBDM 2 are exposed and discussed in the Supplementary Material. Noticeably, quantization impacts the NBDM 1 more than the NC, since the relative positioning between authors varies more in the former. On average, the variation is 13.4 \u00b1 11.37 relative positions of each author in NBDM 1 , while in NC, the variation is 4.9 \u00b1 4.3 positions. Despite the higher variation present in the NBDM 1 , both measures are capable of detecting styles with low and high complexity. Artists such as Mark Rothko, Lucio Fontana, Piet Mondrian, El Lissitzky can be easily identified on the low side of the complexity spectrum. Minimalism, Abstract Expressionism, and Constructivism movements are associated with these styles. On the other hand, artists from Abstract Expressionism, such as Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Jasper Johns, characterize the highest complexity side of the spectrum, as well as other artists with a more detailed and convoluted style, like Gustav Klimt and Vincent van Gogh. Abstract Expressionism is characterized by aggressive features combined with random and geometric features and spontaneity [78]. The reason for Abstract Expressionism artists being present at both extremes of the complexity spectrum is because this style itself divided into two opposites, Action Painting and Color Field. In Action Painting, the paint was thrown directly on the canvas, through instinctive gestures, where chance and randomness determined the evolution of painting [79]. This style is characteristic of artists like Jackson Pollock (known for the technique of \u01e3dripping\u01e5) and Willem de Kooning. On the other hand, Color Field is more mystical and meditative. This style of painting has few elements in the frames, indefinite limits, and explores the sensory effects of color, as well as the subtlety of chromatic relations [80]. A specific example of an artist that followed this trend was Mark Rothko. In all cases, Jackson Pollock had complexity values utterly different from other artists, the average complexity of his paintings being approximate to random (normalized value close to 1). Although he denied his paintings were random, similar results were also found in previous work, which defined Jackson Pollock\u2019s dripping paintings as not typical artworks [5]. 4.2.2 Combining the NC with the roughness exponent of HDC function We used the average NC together with the roughness exponent ( \u03b1 ) of the two-point height difference correlation (HDC) function, which measures the roughness exponents of brightness surfaces, to assess the ability of these measures to distinguish different styles. Accordingly, we made usage of style labeled paintings available in the dataset. From these labeled images, we computed for its author the average NC and the value of \u03b1 . The roughness exponent was used as an additional measure since it has proven to be capable of some differentiation between styles [5]. We discarded the usage of BDM due to quantization impacting it more than the NC. Using the average NC and \u03b1 of each labeled painter, we created a scatter plot (Fig. 5 ) and represented each artistic movement as an ellipse, with the center in the points\u2019 center of mass and with a width corresponding to the standard deviation. As shown in Fig. 5(A), both measures alone are not capable of efficiently separating styles, However, when combined, the styles are well confined into different regions (except for Abstract Expressionism), showing that together these measures are representatives of artistic movements. The roughness exponent \u03b1 captures the level of brightness and relative spatial position and is correlated to variations in painting techniques and genres [5]. The NC adds to the level of brightness and relative spatial position provided by the HDC, the notion of average information present in each artist\u2019s painting. This amount of information differs depending on the artistic movement and historical circumstances. Interestingly, similar to NC, the roughness exponent of the HDC varies greatly in Abstract Expressionism, being that in this artistic movement, there is an inverse correlation between the NC and \u03b1 . Namely, artists like Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning (Action Painting) presented a high average NC and a low \u03b1 , whereas, Mark Rothko (Color Field) had polar results. This atypical behavior corroborates the big difference between the two currents of Abstract Expressionism. The Action Painting usage of instinctive gestures and randomness creates high NC values and spatial correlation approaching a random image. In contrast, in Color Field, we get more minimalist images with high spatial contrast between regions but low complexity. 4.2.3 Local complexity of paintings In this section, we divided the images into identical quadrilateral sizes and measure the algorithmic information for each one ( 16 \u00d7 16 blocks). Then, we computed the average of each quadrilateral for all the paintings for each painter. The results are shown in Fig. 6 , illustrating the same authors as those in Fig. 3. Note however that matrices of Fig. 6 were computed using all the authors\u2019 paintings present in the dataset. The complete results are available on the website associated with this article. The same computation was repeated for blocks of sizes 8 \u00d7 8 and 32 \u00d7 32 . Analysis of these results, included in the Supplementary Material, show that 16 \u00d7 16 is the minimum patch size for which the differences in the compression rate are noticeable and can therefore be used as a measure between paintings. All artists have a unique complexity matrix (fingerprint). This fingerprint shows, on average, where artists paint with more detail and give more emphasis as well as the average range of complexity the artist operates. For instance, Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns show high complexity values dispersed over the canvas. At the same time, artists like Francis Bacon and George de la Tour focus more on the center of the canvas, and Mark Rothko and Piet Mondrian give their highest complexities around the borders of paintings. Since the 16 \u00d7 16 fingerprints conveyed the best results regarding detail and differentiation (see Supplementary Material in Section A.2), the phylogenetic trees were constructed utilizing the distance computed from the fingerprints with block size. Concretely, two phylogenetic trees were constructed to portray the relations between different artists. One tree was constructed using the UPGMA algorithm, which is illustrated in Fig. 7 , and another tree was build using the Kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm [60], which is depicted in the Figure S3 of the Supplementary Material in Section A.4. The tree shows the fingerprint\u2019s capacity of grouping artists from the same artistic movements mutually. Broad groupings of artists from styles are present in the tree, namely, Renaissance, Baroque, Romanticists, Impressionists, Surrealism, Cubism, and Abstract Expressionism. Also, the tree shows smaller groupings of sister leaf-nodes with the same style. On the other hand, the tree depicts relationships of influence between authors of different artistic movements. This relation is seen in the case of Titian, who influenced Diego Velazquez; Caravaggio, who influenced Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n; Frida Kahlo, who influenced Amedeo Modigliani; Sandro Botticelli who influenced William Blake; Claude Lorrain who influenced Joseph Mallord William Turner; and Peter Paul Rubens who influenced Jean-Antoine Watteau. On the other hand, some authors seem unrelated in style and influence, for instance, Francis Bacon and Georges de la Tour, George Braque and Hieronymus Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens and Frida Kahlo, Max Ernst and Giorgione, and Rembrandt van Rijn and Roy Lichtenstein. There can be many reasons for this to occur, for instance, the number of regions the images were divided can be sub-optimal for some images of artistic paintings, decreasing the sensitivity of the measure and jeopardizing the tree\u2019s construction. On the other hand, the algorithm used to measure the similarity between matrices or the algorithm used to construct the tree (UPGMA) may not be the most appropriate for all cases, however, we have tested the Kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm which yielded similar results (see Supplementary Material in section ). Additionally, these seemingly unrelated connections could reveal undiscovered elements and relationships. For instance, one of Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s early artistic idols was Rembrandt van Rijn. Moreover, if artists are not related regarding the artistic movement or influence, the vicinity among them could be representing another property. This aspect is not necessarily related to the period or movement the artists were inserted in, but rather, the way authors projected their compositions, ideas, and impressions onto the canvas. Complexity can be approximated by the total number of properties transmitted by an object and detected by an observer. By dividing images into blocks of equal size and evaluating its local complexity, we are quantifying the local information being transmitted. On the other hand, by averaging the canvas results per artist, we obtain a matrix that describes how the author exposes information to the observer. This information intertwines various notions critical to how the work is perceived, such as composition which describes where the artist places the subject and how the background elements support it, as well as the unity, balance, movement, rhythm, focus, contrast, pattern, and proportion of the painting. For instance, the proximity between Hans Holbein and Vermeer could be due to both of them having used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, namely by performing a combination of curved mirrors, camera obscura, and camera lucida [81]. Another example that this information can convey is space by depicting where positive (subject itself, which is usually more detailed) and negative (the area of painting around it) spaces are on the canvas. Artists can play with a balance between these two spaces to further influence how viewers interpret their work. Therefore, the similarity between different artists concerning the regional (local) complexity can reflect the similarity in thought regarding their approaches to painting. For instance, the proximity between Francis Bacon and Georges de la Tour could be due to the former being heavily influenced by the Baroque style and having made dramatic use of contrasts of light and shadow. These methods are characteristic of the chiaroscuro principle and its radicalization in the Tenebrista school (signature style of Georges de la Tour) [82,83]. The intense contrasts of light and shadow highlight the characters, and although exaggerated, it is lighting that increases the feeling of realism, making the muscles and facial expressions more evident. Simultaneously, the presence of large blackened areas highlights the chromatic research and the illuminated space, which acquire their value as elements of the composition. We conclude that this novel technique is a unique descriptor of the authors\u2019 paintings since it not only aggregates authors of the same style close to each other and demonstrates the influences that authors had on others. It also serves as an insight into the way the artist projects its art. 4.2.4 Evaluation of measures for classification purposes To quantitatively evaluate the use of these measures for classification purposes, we assessed their impact when used as additional features to improve state-of-the-art classification methods. For this purpose, we recreated a recently published state-of-the-art method as a baseline and improved the results by combining our proposed measures. Based on current methods [52,53], we extracted a Gram representation using the first convolutional layer from the fifth convolutional block of the VGG16 network which was pre-trained with the imagenet dataset (no significant result difference was found between the use of VGG16 or VGG19). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the Gram matrix to reduce the dimensionality and, finally, this vector was provided to an SVM to perform classification. Afterwards, the features obtained from computing the HDC and the regional complexity were used for author and style classification using the XGBoost classifier [84] and combined with the baseline classifier via a Voting Classifier ensemble. The results of the baseline and ensemble classifiers, applied to the Paintings91 dataset in the author and style classification task using the labels provided in the dataset, are shown in Table 1 . The results show that the inclusion of the Regional Complexity, increased the accuracy of the results 2.2 p.p. and 1.0 p.p in the style and author classification tasks respectively. Moreover, the overall inclusion of the proposed measures (HDC + RC) increased the accuracy in both classification tasks by 2.8 p.p. and, 2.0 p.p. in the style and author classification tasks, respectively. These results indicate that these predictors are useful auxiliary features capable of improving current methodologies in the classification of artistic paintings. This is congruent with the results obtained with Nanny et al. [85], since handcrafted features and non-handcrafted features seem to extract different information from the input images and, as a result, the fusion of the two types of features improves the results obtained when using non-handcrafted features only. Furthermore, regional complexity (RC) has a higher impact on the improvement of the accuracy than the HDC features, demonstrating the importance and distinction of Regional Complexity as a feature. 5 Discussion In this work, we develop, use, and compare unsupervised pattern recognition techniques to quantify information in images of artistic paintings. We rely on two approaches, namely data compression using the Normalized Compression (NC), and the Block Decomposition Method (BDM), to estimate information of both probabilistic and algorithmic sources. To approximate the NC, we benchmark a set of data compressors, where we show that the most effective for this dataset is PAQ8. Subsequently, this article is organized into two broad sections. The first is the evaluation and comparison of information-based measures; the second is applying these information-based measures to a dataset of artistic paintings. On the measure evaluation section, we assessed the NC and BDM using three tests. In the first test, we evaluated the NC and two normalizations of the BDM, regarding their robustness when images undergo uniform pixel editing and their behavior when applied to different types of datasets. We found that in terms of uniform pixel editing, the NC is more robust than BDM with the same kind of normalization. The NC is a measure of compression (in this case, using the PAQ compressor) that makes use of the digital object in its entirety to create the shortest possible representation without loss of information. In contrast, BDM divides the digital object into blocks and, based on the complexity of the blocks, estimates the image complexity in its entirety. This means that BDM cannot determine the information shared between the blocks, which causes it to increase, when compared to the NC, with the increase in uniform pixel editing. In the second test, we compared both measures using different image natures. We found that the results of the NC and NBDM are similar, except for the computed radiography and the cellular automata dataset, which exhibited a more algorithmic behavior. The cellular automata data was created with small programs with simple rules. While the compressor had difficulty compressing this data, BDM could approximate their algorithmic nature and thus assign them a value close to a minimal complexity value. The ability to identify an algorithmic nature incorporated in the data demonstrates the relevance of BDM as a measure. In the third test, we found that a super sample image transformation causes an underestimation of the amount of information contained in the object by BDM. Again, this is due to BDM analysing the object in blocks, instead of using the object in its entirety. Since the ampliation size was the same as the blocks analysed by BDM, the complexity attributed to each block was approximately zero. Consequently, the overall value attributed to the image complexity decreased dramatically. This aspect demonstrated that BDM cannot handle information contained between each block and can easily underestimate the amount of information present in a digital object. In the second phase, we applied these measures to estimate the complexity of a dataset of paintings. We calculated the NC and NBDM in this dataset with different quantizations and assessed the results in terms of average complexity per author. Afterward, we combined the NC with the exponent of the roughness of the HDC function in the labeled paintings of the dataset. Finally, we computed the average regional complexity of each author regarding their paintings and built a phylogenetic tree. We found that paintings with low complexity are abstract, minimalist, and follow simple patterns. Paintings with a slightly higher average complexity possess different regional complexities, specifically, a region with high complexity and detail surrounded by a background of low complexity. With more complexity, this noticeable pattern begins to fade, and the most complex paintings are globally irregular, detailed, and convoluted. Regarding the average complexity values for each artist, we found that NC and NBDM behave similarly, where quantization impacted more the NBDM. We also found that the low side of the complexity spectrum was characterized by Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Constructivism movements, with authors such as Mark Rothko, Lucio Fontana, Piet Mondrian, and El Lissitzky. Also, artists from Abstract Expressionism characterized the high complexity side of the spectrum, such as Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Jasper Johns, as well as other artists with a more detailed and convoluted style, like Gustav Klimt and Vincent van Gogh. Due to two different currents (Color Field with authors with low average complexity and Action Painting with authors with high complexity), Abstract Expressionism was present at the polar ends of the spectrum. In all cases, Jackson Pollock had average complexity values that were utterly different from other artists, being the average complexity of his paintings close to random. Although he denied being a creator of random paintings, this result and others [5] seem to indicate that Jackson Pollock\u2019s dripping paintings are not typical artworks, and this is possibly related to the inclusion of many symbolic layers and dispersion intentions over the canvas by the author. When evaluating the artists\u2019 average NC together with the roughness exponent ( \u03b1 ) of the HDC function in the labels images of the dataset, we found that styles are well confined into different regions, showing that the combination of these measures gives a robust representation of artistic movements. The NC adds to the level of brightness and relative spatial position evidenced by the roughness exponent, the notion of average information present in each artist\u2019s painting, which is consistent within the same style and historical circumstances. We also find that in Abstract Expressionism, the NC is inversely correlated to \u03b1 . Concretely, artists related to Colour Field painting presented a high \u03b1 and low NC, whereas artists related to Action Painting presented the exact polar results (low \u03b1 and high NC). Finally, we divided the image into equal quadrilateral parts and estimated the local complexity of each painting on the dataset and used it to ascertain each artists average regional matrix (fingerprint). Complexity can be thought of as a measure of the total number of properties transmitted by an object and detected by an observer. By dividing images into blocks of equal size and evaluating its local complexity, we quantified the local information being transmitted. Furthermore, by averaging the canvas results per artist, we obtain a unique fingerprint that describes how the author exposes information to the observer. Among other things, these fingerprints give specific insights regarding each artist\u2019s way of painting, showing where, on average, artists paint with more detail and give more emphasis, while also providing insights into each artist\u2019s range of complexity. Using these matrices, we computed a distance matrix and utilized it to construct a phylogenetic tree. We discovered that these phylogenetic trees aggregated authors of the same style close to each other, as well as artists\u2019 influence relationships, like Francis Bacon and Georges de la Tour, and George Braque and Hieronymus Bosch. Furthermore, we observed proximity between artists due to shared methods and techniques which are not correlated with the temporal era or artistic movement. An example of this occurrence is the proximity between Hans Holbein and Vermeer which don\u2019t share styles, but both used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions. This evidence shows that artists\u2019 fingerprints contain critical information into how the work is perceived, such as composition, unity, balance, movement, rhythm, focus, contrast, pattern, and proportion of the painting and space. Finally, we show that these measures improve current methodologies in the classification of artistic paintings and thus extract information which differs from non-handcrafted features. Furthermore, regional complexity provided the largest increase in accuracy on the classification tasks, showing its relevance as a descriptor of images of artistic paintings. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we introduce novel solutions to the field of computer analysis of artistic paintings and the problem of artist classification and authentication. Specifically, we assessed the viability of unsupervised measures that approximate the quantity of probabilistic and algorithmic information for performing these tasks. Our direct comparison between NC and BDM allowed us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both measures. Although BDM has difficulty dealing with uniform pixel edition and full information quantification given the block representability, it serves as a useful tool for measure and indentification of data content having similarity to simple algorithms. On the other hand, the NC is more robust to data alterations (pixel edition and quantization) and is able to measure the quantity of information without underestimation. Regarding the application of information-based measures in artistic paintings, we studied and developed techniques that can be valuable for art authorship attribution and validation, art style categorization and organization, and art content explanation. Namely, the NC proved to be a robust measure that as a whole gives us some insight regarding the complexity of different styles showing hidden patterns and relationships present in artistic paintings that share the same range in complexity. Furthermore, it could be a stylistic descriptor when coupled with the roughness exponent \u03b1 . On the other hand, fingerprints depict how each author perform typical content distribution on canvas. Thus, they can provide a suitable means of art content explanation, as well as being valuable for art authorship attribution and validation. Moreover, since they provided insights regarding the artists\u2019 way of painting, they can be used as a means of relating authors, being therefore useful for depicting artists\u2019 stylistic influences, and shared techniques. Additionally, using the distance between the artists\u2019 regional complexity, we also find some interesting links between authors regarding the usage of space, technique, composition, rhythm, and proportion. Finally, we demonstrated that the regional complexity and the HDC function of the paintings could serve as useful auxiliary features capable of improving current methodologies in author and style classification of images of artistic paintings. Regarding future continuations to this study, there are many possible future lines of work that can be considered. For example, in this work we analysed the images of paintings by converting them to monochrome, and it would be interesting to separate the colour channels and to analyse them separately, therefore studying the influence of colour in the paintings in terms of complexity. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how to separate different characteristics of the fingerprint, as well as detecting unknown repeated patterns that appear multiple times in a painting by creating and analysing their complexity surfaces [13]. Lastly, another interesting study would be to replicate the developed work in this article using a competitive compressor that would select the best compressor model for each painting or region.

In this paper, we identify hidden patterns and relationships present in artistic paintings by analysing their complexity, a measure that quantifies the sum of characteristics of an object. Specifically, we apply Normalized Compression (NC) and the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) to a dataset of 4,266 paintings from 91 authors and examine the potential of these information-based measures as descriptors of artistic paintings. Both measures consistently described the equivalent types of paintings, authors, and artistic movements. Moreover, combining the NC with a measure of the roughness of the paintings creates an efficient stylistic descriptor. Furthermore, by quantifying the local information of each painting, we define a fingerprint that describes critical information regarding the artists\u2019 style, their artistic influences, and shared techniques. More fundamentally, this information describes how each author typically composes and distributes the elements across the canvas and, therefore, how their work is perceived. Finally, we demonstrate that regional complexity and two-point height difference correlation function are useful auxiliary features that improve current methodologies in style and author classification of artistic paintings. The whole study is supported by an extensive website (http://panther.web.ua.pt) for fast author characterization and authentication.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2021-06-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321000510", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Silva, Jorge Miguel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pratas, Diogo"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Antunes, Rui"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Matos, S\u00e9rgio"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pinho, Armando J."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321000510"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321000510"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0031-3203(21)00051-0", "prism:volume": "114", "articleNumber": "107864", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "Automatic analysis of artistic paintings using information-based measures", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
