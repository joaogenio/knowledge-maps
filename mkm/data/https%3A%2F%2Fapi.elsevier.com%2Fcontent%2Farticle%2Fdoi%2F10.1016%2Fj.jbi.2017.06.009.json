Graphical abstract In the past decade, digital pathology and whole-slide imaging (WSI) have been gaining momentum with the proliferation of digital scanners from different manufacturers. The literature reports significant advantages associated with the adoption of digital images in pathology, namely, improvements in diagnostic accuracy and better support for telepathology. Moreover, it also offers new clinical and research applications. However, numerous barriers have been slowing the adoption of WSI, among which the most important are performance issues associated with storage and distribution of huge volumes of data, and lack of interoperability with other hospital information systems, most notably Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) based on the DICOM standard. This article proposes an architecture of a Web Pathology PACS fully compliant with DICOM standard communications and data formats. The solution includes a PACS Archive responsible for storing whole-slide imaging data in DICOM WSI format and offers a communication interface based on the most recent DICOM Web services. The second component is a zero-footprint viewer that runs in any web-browser. It consumes data using the PACS archive standard web services. Moreover, it features a tiling engine especially suited to deal with the WSI image pyramids. These components were designed with special focus on efficiency and usability. The performance of our system was assessed through a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions. The results demonstrate that it is possible to have a very competitive solution based on standard workflows. Keywords Whole-slide imaging DICOM PACS Pathology Web Viewer 1 Introduction Pathology focuses mainly on the identification structural anomalies, through the naked eye or a microscope, and on the detection of possible relationships with functional disorders of tissues, therefore, identifying diseases. The aim of pathology has remained unchanged over time; focused on the analysis and comparison of tissue specimens on specific glass slides. For this, the use of optical microscopes has been fundamental since it was the only available instrumentation for centuries [1]. Despite using very methodical analysis workflows, it is possible for the same professional to draw different conclusions about the same specimen at different times. Moreover, asking for second opinions is common practice, and specific cases could be part of conferences or external quality assurance programs [2]. Consequently, there is the requirement for glass slides storage and delivery infrastructures. However, the specimen storage process is expensive, requiring accessibility, cleaning, and protection, which entails greater care by specialized staff. In contrast, digital storage and distribution cuts these costs and increases the throughput of pathology laboratories. In this context, the branch of digital pathology and whole-slide imaging arises. These recent concepts refer to the digital capture of an image from a classic glass slide as well as to the field of information systems for managing the associated data. The arrival of Digital Slide Scanners (DSS) has introduced the concept of whole-slide images (WSI). As the name suggests, these images capture the slide as a whole, rather than specific artifacts found by pathologists. As such, they can be captured unattendedly and screened later. These large images have characteristics, forms of handling and operation similar to images produced by optical microscopes [3]. It is worth mentioning that a typical slide scanned at \u00d740 (approx. 1600 megapixels) produces a file with several gigabytes [4,5] and requires a viewer application with special functionality to fulfill the pathologist\u2019s needs [6]. Digital pathology and whole-slide imaging have been gaining momentum with the proliferation of digital scanners from different manufacturers [5,7]. The literature reports significant advantages associated with the adoption of digital images in pathology [8\u201311], namely, improvements in diagnostic accuracy, promotion of distributed work processes (e.g. telepathology), integration of images with hospital information systems and economic efficiency gains. Moreover, WSI offers new clinical and research applications to the pathology community [5,12]. However, numerous barriers have been slowing this process, including performance issues, workflow efficiency, infrastructure, and integration with other software [8,9]. Despite being a medical imaging modality, pathology studies have been kept away from standard Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS), in proprietary formats and information systems [5,7]. In part because the DICOM standard did not address all the necessary requirements, but also due to the technical challenges raised by whole-slide imaging. As a result, major DDS vendors preferred to use proprietary archives and image formats (e.g. NDPI, SVS, and TIFF) [5,13]. However, in the last few years, whole-slide imaging has been incorporated in the DICOM standard, and vendors are slowly starting to support DICOM in their scanners. This opens the door to the use of vendor-neutral DICOM-compliant archives and services for storage processes and for exchanging data with viewer applications [6]. Moreover, such a system would support third-party applications to access the WSI images directly. Nonetheless, WSI in general purpose PACS is still a mirage, because traditional solutions are not ready to handle the remarkable image resolution and volumes of data generated from each study, requiring new architectures for storage, efficient distribution, and visualization across heterogeneous systems [3]. In this paper, we propose an architecture to include digital pathology workflows in a general purpose PACS using exclusively DICOM standard data formats and communications. The PACS archive provides storage and access to the WSI data via the most recent DICOM Web services which follow the RESTful Web services principles. This flexible interface allows a specific region (i.e. tile) of the large WSI matrix to be requested. A web viewer application that includes a tiling engine specially designed to fulfill the WSI navigation requirements was also developed. It consumes the WSI data directly from the PACS via its DICOM services. This viewer application features all typical tools available in proprietary solutions. The whole solution usability, performance, and efficiency were evaluated. The performance implication of serving WSI was assessed and the results demonstrate an architecture capable of efficiently supporting pathology imaging workflows. The main goal was to demonstrate that it is possible to support a digital pathology laboratory in a common hospital PACS, opening doors to the proliferation of vendor-neutral equipment and application to digital pathology. 2 Background 2.1 PACS and DICOM The DICOM Standard has been the principle driving force behind the adoption of Picture Archive and Communication Systems [14]. DICOM defines not only the storage format for medical images but also the communication protocol for exchanging images and related meta-data among different PACS applications. DICOM objects come coupled with a wide-range of meta-data related to the image itself, the acquisition procedure, and the different stakeholders involved, such as patients, physicians and institutions. The standard defines thoroughly which information should be included in each modality, as well as the image organization in the DICOM Files. This allows DICOM to address the needs of medical imaging workflows and provide general purpose and vendor image formats [14]. Initially, DICOM was developed as a standard for radiology modalities. Nonetheless, it has rapidly spread its coverage to other medical specialties, such as cardiology or ophthalmology [14], due to the benefit of aggregating all patient imaging history in the PACS. The first attempt to introduce microscopy into DICOM dates to 1999, with the addition of the visible light supplement 15 [15]. As stated in [15], the scope of this supplement was to support visible light images acquired by endoscopes, microscopes or photographic cameras. This extension to the standard introduced four new modalities: Endoscopy (ES), Microscopy (GM), Automated-Stage Microscopy (SM), and Photography (XC). WSI was not included in this supplement since the technology was in its early stages. Therefore, the requirements of pathologists were not fulfilled and they continued to work without standard digital imaging end systems. Nevertheless, the automated stage microscopy modality opened the door to automated whole-slide scanners in DICOM. The rising interest in WSI motivated the constitution of DICOM Workgroup 26 with the intention of supporting whole-slide imaging in DICOM. This required alterations to the standard, not only at the image storage level, to handle images with very high resolutions, but also to the information model [16]. The traditional DICOM information model is patient-centric as opposed to the microscopy environment where the specimen is the most relevant subject [16]. The DICOM supplement 122 [17] was the first contribution of this workgroup and introduces the concept of a specimen and container. Moreover, it also includes new data elements necessary to more accurately describe the workflows associated with WSI preparation and acquisition [14]. 2.2 Whole-slide imaging visualization WSI presented major challenges for medical imaging visualization. These images cannot be fully displayed in their maximum resolution, not only because there are no displays supporting such resolutions, but also because their size is much greater than the amount of memory available in most computers [13,18]. As a result, pathologists screening these images use a pan & zoom strategy. This involves browsing and selecting sub-regions with diagnostic interest in a lower resolution image and then zooming into a higher resolution whenever more detail is needed. Nowadays, most Internet users are accustomed to this process because of the map browsers available online, such as Google Maps. The arrangement of the image pixel data in the storage data structure has significant performance implications for the visualization processes. The simplest, and most common, way of storing two-dimensional images is in a single frame/page, where the image pixels are stored in a sequential array. Normally, pixels are oriented horizontally, by rows, although they could follow a vertical orientation just as easily. However, this organization has limitations in the WSI screening paradigm, because it does not provide direct access to 2D sub-regions. As a result, all the regions\u2019 overlapping rows must be loaded completely, which due to the gigantic size of WSI may not fit into the system capabilities [18]. An illustration of this limitation is provided on the left of Fig. 1 . In order to retrieve the green region, all the pixels in red must be retrieved because they are arranged sequentially. A more efficient way of storing high-resolution WSI is using a tiled organization, illustrated in Fig. 1(middle), where the entire image is stored in rectangular regions sequentially. Despite being a more complex organization, it enables direct access to these sub-regions. As a result, in order to load the green region, it is only necessary to retrieve a smaller image subset composed only of the overlapping tiles [3], as shown in Fig. 1. The tile size has a significant effect on the retrieval performance and its optimum value is influenced not only by the physical storage medium but also by the viewer display resolution. While a tiled organization facilitates the panning processes, the zooming process on the other hand is still a challenge. At lower resolutions, larger areas of the image must be accessed in order to display the requested region, as shown in Fig. 1(middle). In the extreme case, a thumbnail requires the entire image data to be processed. This would probably be a very intensive task. In order to optimize zooming, a lower resolution version of the full image can be pre-calculated and stored alongside the full resolution image. Thus, the typical image pyramid organization arises, as shown in Fig. 1(right). According to this scheme, the WSI consists of multiple images at different magnifications where the pyramid provides distinct zoom level. The base of the pyramid contains the highest resolution, while the top contains the lowest resolution image, typically a thumbnail. The thumbnail is a very low-resolution version of the image, making it easy to see the entire image. One or more levels may be created, at intermediate resolutions, to facilitate the loading of arbitrary magnification levels. Each pyramid level follows the tiled organization described above. These strategies are valid for open and proprietary image formats. DICOM Workgroup 26 also adopted the image pyramid concept and introduced it in the standard. The DICOM Supplement 145 [19] takes advantage of the existing multi-frame objects where each sub-resolution image is stored in a separate multi-frame object, while the individual tiles are stored as separated frames. Each resolution level is assigned a different DICOM series. The standard also supports 3D microscopy, a technique that acquires multiple planes of the slide at different depths [20]. Therefore, each resolution level may contain several Z-planes, which represent acquisition at different focal points. The Z-planes can be stored as separate objects within the DICOM series or, alternatively, in the image object with the corresponding magnification level. 2.3 Content discovery and retrieval DICOM defines a set of content discovery and retrieval services, the basis of PACS communications. The most typical services, C-Store, C-Find, and C-Move, allow data, images and/or metadata to be stored, searched and retrieved respectively. These services are built on top of a customized application layer protocol, which is defined in the standard. This has led to multiple problems when using DICOM outside institutional Intranets. The advent of web-based technologies and the necessity of interconnecting multiple medical imaging laboratories across the Internet has led to the addition of several content discovery and retrieval services supported by web-services. Initially, DICOM WADO via Web-Services was defined in supplement 148 [21]. It enabled access to the attributes of DICOM Objects using SOAP web-services. These services mapped the functionality provided by the traditional DICOM C-Move [22]. However, SOAP is considered a heavyweight technology for web-services, because the verbose messages make them difficult to include in lightweight applications, such as websites. Therefore, the community demanded the inclusion of simpler services based on the Restful technology. Moreover, web services for searching and storage were also requested. So in 2014, the standard introduced three REST web services: STOW-RS, 1 URL: service-endpoint/studies; HTTP \u2013 POST. 1 QIDO-RS, 2 URL: service-endpoint/studies/{StudyInstanceUID}/series/{SeriesInstanceUID}/instances; HTTP \u2013 GET. 2 and WADO-RS. 3 URL: service-endpoint/studies/{StudyInstanceUID}/series/{SeriesInstanceUID}/instances/{SOPInstanceUID}/frames/{FrameList}; HTTP \u2013 GET. 3 Besides the traditional DICOM Services and web-services, DICOM also contemplates storage and streaming of JPEG2000 images. Currently, JPEG2000 is the most advanced format for general purpose images. The standard defines a lossless compression algorithm, as well as a protocol for \u201cinteracting with JPEG2000 based images in an efficient and effective manner\u201d [23]. In fact, the JPEG2000 standard has a special focus towards image interactivity, supporting interesting features such as resolution scalability, progressive refinement and spatial randomness [23,24]. The JPIP protocol allows viewer application to interact with JPEG2000 images over networks. By using JPIP, viewer applications do not have to download the whole image, and can instead request from the JPIP server a particular region that best fits their visualization purposes [23,25]. This image streaming strategy allows the storage and consistency of image data to be optimized, as well as reducing the required bandwidth to support visualization of remote images [25]. The DICOM Standard supports both JPEG2000 images and the JPIP protocol. Supplement 61 [26] introduced the JPEG2000 format into regular DICOM images. The JPEG2000 pixel data is stored in the DICOM image pixel data attribute, just like any other compression format such as JPEG Baseline or JPEG-LS. As such, this supplement introduced two new transfer syntaxes: 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90, and 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91. The support for JPIP was introduced by supplement 106 [27]. In this case, the image pixel data is replaced by the JPIP server URL. As a result, the viewer application can request the image directly from the JPIP server, without mediation from the PACS Archive. This behavior is supported by the transfer syntaxes: 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.94, and 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.95. 2.4 Related work In the scope of this work, an exhaustive search was performed for PACS/DICOM solutions that support digital pathology workflows, not only in the scientific literature but also in commercial applications. We searched in Scopus using the following keywords: DICOM Pathology Viewer, Web Pathology Viewer and DICOM Whole Slide Imaging. The queries matched 144 articles, of which 33 were found relevant to the topic. A detailed examination of these documents allowed us to conclude that there is no solution, commercial or not, for supporting DICOM WSI in a general purpose PACS resorting only to DICOM compliant communications. Moreover, only a much-reduced number of solutions provided a centralized repository compliant with Cloud Computing requirements, i.e. a network archive and a zero footprint web-viewer ready to run in any common web-browser without third-party software requirements or setup processes. Another important aspect is that many of these solutions required very complex server-side setups in order to achieve good performance [13]. However, the most important conclusion is that, despite being specified in the DICOM Standard, WSI is not currently efficiently supported by vendors [18]. 2.4.1 Repositories and data formats Currently, there is a multitude of image formats used by whole-slide imaging equipment vendors, most notably TIFF, JPEG, JPEG2000, SVS or ndpi [5,28]. These formats represent the most commonly accepted way of storing large images using a pyramidal and tiled structure. In this picture, the TIFF format comes as a convenient container, since it supports multiple tiles and multiple compression algorithms. Moreover, it allows storing multiple images in a single file, which is useful for storing multiple pyramid levels for faster browsing. TIFF also enables semi-structured meta-data to be recorded within the image. Another promising format for whole-slide imaging is JPEG2000. In [6], the authors report that previously to the DICOM Standard, encoding images in JPEG2000 and serving them as JPIP was a workaround for supporting WSI in standard PACS. Such an approach was applied in a solution for browsing mammography images [25]. In [29], a solution with a JPIP viewer is used for supporting education in virtual microscopy. A study addressing the use of virtual microscopy in mobile devices also applied the JPEG2000 image format along with several optimization strategies [13]. A study assessing the performance of JPEG2000 and JPIP protocol for whole-slide imaging was presented in [30]. An optimal combination of JPEG2000 compression algorithm parameters was evaluated for fulfilling the WSI usage requirements. However, there is no discussion about the method that enabled them to draw such conclusions. An empirical process, rather than a quantifiable one, may compromise the validity of such conclusions. The authors also compared their solution performance against a Zoomify 4 http://www.zoomify.com/. 4 server. The JPIP Server reportedly managed 33% more users than the Zoomify server. In order to overcome the lack of a de facto standard format for WSI images and as an effort to manage the wide variety of proprietary protocols, the OpenSlide project [31] provides a C library capable of reading and manipulating slides from different vendor formats. Currently, it supports Aperio, Leica, and Hamamatsu among others but, unfortunately, DICOM is not supported. This library provides an abstraction to the applications developer, who may shift his focus from the multitude of vendor formats to the OpenSlide\u2019s unified API. However, a unified API reduces the extractable information to a subset of common information elements. While this does not hinder the extraction of pixel data itself, it affects the metadata related to the image, which in fact has been crucial for the success of the DICOM standard. OpenSlide also provides a web-based viewer that consumes WSIs converted to Microsoft\u2019s Deep Zoom format. In contrast, our architecture resorts exclusively to the DICOM standard for data format and communications. We provide a full-featured Web viewer platform compliant with DICOM. As a result, third-party applications can access to DICOM WSIs, including their metadata. The adoption of DICOM by the major scanner vendors has been delayed due to various reasons, most notably patent ownerships and concerns about the DICOM standard not being able of delivering sufficient performance for use in pathology laboratories. Initiatives, such as described in this article, may contribute to foster the adoption of the standard by demystifying the supposedly negative impact of DICOM format and communications on delivering WSI services. Meanwhile, while the standard is not widely adopted by vendors, a compromise solution is to \u201cDICOMize\u201d, i.e. convert proprietary formats into DICOM, for instance leveraging the OpenSlide library to read the proprietary formats. However, this approach has a major drawback when it comes to fulfilling the DICOM requirements in terms of metadata, namely because it cannot be completely extracted from proprietary formats by third-party applications or simply because these formats do not contain that information. 2.4.2 Content distribution and visualization In [32], a distributed collaborative system for pathologists is described. The article refers to [19], stating that their system is able to export lower-resolution pixel data into DICOM files. The system is supported by a Zoomify web viewer that uses its own file format rather than DICOM. Moreover, the database model described in the article does not include the necessary information to build DICOM compliant WSI. The PAIS project, described in [3], hosts a database for supporting research using WSI. The article describes a comprehensive data model that is considered suitable for supporting a Pathology PACS system. However, the system's interfaces are not DICOM, but custom-made web-services. Moreover, the images seem to be stored in different TIFF files, separated by regions. In their web-site, at least some images are in Asperio's SVS format. A distribution platform based on JPEG2000 and JPIP is presented in [33]. It includes a JVS DICOM Workstation that interacts with the PACS Archive using traditional DICOM Query/Retrieve services. The images are provided to the workstations by a JPIP Server deployed alongside the PACS Archive. These workstations receive a JPIP reference and open an external JPIP viewer to display the WSI images. This article also presents the compressor application that converts the proprietary WSI format to DICOM-compatible JPEG2000 transfer syntax. However, this platform is only compatible with Windows OS and is no longer supported. Dcm-Ar is a web solution based on Adobe Flash [34]. It uses a proprietary protocol that implements progressive image transition, a process similar to JPIP. Because it does not use DICOM services for image distribution, a proxy server is required to support DICOM communications with the PACS archive. This viewer is claimed as being able to display large DICOM images. However, the images used in the validation study only ranged from 10 to 30MB. The article does not refer to any specific modality. In [12], the authors developed a browser-based WSI viewer using Microsoft Silverlight. Similarly, there are many other visualization solutions reported in the literature built entirely using HTML and JavaScript technologies, such as [35], but they do not seem to support whole-slide microscopy. 3 Proposed architecture This section describes an architecture for a fully DICOM compliant PACS for digital pathology. It supports storage, discovery, retrieval and interactive visualization of whole-slide images and fulfills the major requirement of using only DICOM compliant communications and data formats. Pure Web technologies are exploited, leading to a solution that is well suited to Cloud Computing environments. 3.1 Components Apart from acquisition equipment, the proposed architecture has two major components: a PACS Archive and a Web viewer application (Fig. 2 ). The PACS Archive is the central component that provides services for storage, content discovery and retrieval of medical images. It is based on Dicoogle, an open source project offering a plugin-based architecture and a software development kit [36,37] and intended to support the research and development of new PACS components and applications. In this case, an efficient DICOM WSI pyramid generator and a DICOM Web services API were developed, capable of providing tiles at distinct zoom levels. A zero-footprint viewer application, with its own tiling engine, was developed exclusively based on HTML5 and JavaScript technologies. This client is a multi-platform web application that allows pathologists to search over the Pathology PACS archive, retrieve WSI studies and manipulate them in a general-purpose web-browser (e.g. Chrome or Safari). Its tiling engine uses the streaming paradigm to avoid downloading whole images and makes use exclusively of the DICOM Standard for communications with the PACS archive, namely through its DICOM Web services interface. The viewer workstation is a fundamental component of the proposed architecture. To be useful in real-world environments, a set of common tools required by pathologists to review the slide images is provided, such as annotations and filters, for example. Our viewer uses the pan & zoom navigation paradigm described in the background section. In order to be efficient, it makes use of the image pyramids available in the PACS archive and only downloads and maintains in memory portions of the WSI required to display the current viewport region of interest. To do this, it must retrieve some information about the image, namely, its dimension, resolution, z-planes, and the image pyramid configuration. Additionally, for each sub-resolution level, it needs information about its dimension, resolution and tile configuration. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Image acquisition The journey to support WSI in general purpose PACS begins with the image acquisition itself. Digital scanners are able to capture digital images directly from glass slides. After the acquisition, images must be moved to the PACS Archive for long-term storage. This procedure is analogous to other medical imaging modalities. Our architecture contemplates two services to accomplish this task. The images can be uploaded to the PACS Archive via the traditional DICOM C-Store service or by its web-service counterpart, the STOW-RS. As digital scanner manufacturers gradually start to support DICOM in their equipment, exporting the DICOM WSI directly from the acquisition equipment to the archive should be straightforward. In fact, we have already sent images to our Pathology PACS directly from a whole-slide scanner of a major vendor. This stage is illustrated in Fig. 3 , step 1. Nonetheless, this process can raise two major issues related to image compression and to the configuration of the image pyramid. These factors have a considerable impact both on the PACS long-term performance, and on the image visualization procedure itself. However, they are subject to the acquisition equipment capabilities and configurations. Regarding image compression, the algorithm used by the acquisition equipment may not be suited to fulfill the PACS requirements, thus creating larger images that would ruin the PACS long-term storage capacity. Conversely, the acquisition equipment could apply an irreversible compression algorithm that produces images unfit for medical diagnosis. As a result, adequately configuring the acquisition equipment is a major requirement for an efficient PACS. Our archive can be configured to recompress the incoming images with a fitter algorithm according to the PACS administrator\u2019s preference. This stage is illustrated in Fig. 3, step 2. Regarding the image pyramid configuration, this article already discussed its major importance in the screening procedure. The acquisition equipment could be configured to produce only the larger resolution image or, alternatively, to create the image pyramid and send several sub-resolution images to the archive. Since the image pyramid configuration influences the performance of the visualization procedure, we argue that it should be generated in the PACS to achieve an optimal compromise between storage space and efficient access. In fact, our PACS Archive is able to generate the sub-resolution images solely based on the largest resolution image. When new images arrive at our PACS, the procedure for generating the image pyramid is scheduled. Depending on the image dimensions and compression used, it could be an intensive process, therefore it is performed as a background process to avoid overloading. This stage is illustrated in Fig. 3, step 3. 3.2.2 Content discovery and visualization The next step in the workflow requires finding a certain image, or specimen, in the archive. In order to discover DICOM WSI in the Pathology PACS, the traditional DICOM Query and Retrieve services (i.e. C-FIND and C-MOVE), as well as the more recent DICOM QIDO-RS service [21], can be used. These services allow searching in the DICOM images metadata. As such, information about the available images can be retrieved, as well as objects of interest described within it, such as Patients or Specimens. Orchestration of these services enables the development of advanced query interfaces that could be implemented by multiple vendors. We have tested our architecture using Dicoogle\u2019s own search interface, as well as BMD\u2019s software PACS Center, which is an enterprise solution. Our viewer makes use of existing image pyramids in the PACS archive because this method is more efficient than generating the image pyramids on demand. In order to do this, it has to retrieve some information about every resolution level of the image, namely, its dimension, resolution, z-planes, and last but not the least, the image pyramid configuration. This information is retrieved from the PACS archive using the DICOM QIDO-RS, i.e. the standard DICOM Web service for querying. The different sub-resolution images can be found by submitting a query for \u201cSeriesInstanceUID\u201d, for which the archive returns a list of instances that belong to the specified series. In order to organize the image pyramid in terms of resolution, the viewer firstly looks for the instance with the attribute \u201cImage Type (0008,0008)\u201d equal to \u201cORIGINAL/PRIMARY/VOLUME\u201d. This instance has the maximum resolution. In contrast, instances of this attribute ending in \u201c../VOLUME/DERIVED\u201d are sub-resolution images. For each of these images, the viewer computes their magnification rate based on the image size (cols x rows). As a result, the visualization platform builds an internal representation of the image pyramid, as illustrated in Fig. 3, step 4. At this point, the viewer is ready to download the required image tiles and start displaying them. Initially, it identifies the resolution level in the image pyramid\u2019s that is closest to the viewport window resolution. This minimizes the amount of pixel data exchanged between the PACS archive and the remote viewer, as well as the complexity of the resizing operation required to fit the pixel data to the viewport window. The image pixel data is retrieved from the archive using the DICOM WADO-RS service. The viewer specifies the image SOP, Study, and Series UIDs, as well as the list of frames to be retrieved. Remember that the image tiles are stored in individual frames, as described in the Background section. After receiving the frames, the viewer copies their pixel data into the window viewport, thus displaying the image. If the retrieved frames do not fit the viewport requirements exactly, the viewer also performs a resizing and cropping operation on the tiles\u2019 pixel data. This is completely performed client-side, to avoid loading the PACS archive with additional image operations which could compromise the platform\u2019s performance and scalability. Panning and zooming operations are resolved analogously by the viewer. In each event the user performs on the viewport, the tiling engine recalculates the closest resolution level and the underlying image tiles. These tiles are requested via DICOM WADO-RS and displayed on the window\u2019s viewport. As expressed, the application supports several filters to the original image that are performed client-side and therefore have no additional impact on the solution\u2019s server-side performance. 4 Validation This section provides several controlled laboratory trials aiming to validate the proposed architecture. The goal is to show that it is possible to support digital pathology efficiently in a general purpose PACS with fully DICOM compliant communications, and without compromising the system\u2019s overall quality of service. To do this, several trials were made targeting the challenges faced by our architecture, namely the storage space required and the content retrieval performance. When possible, the trials included the comparison of our architecture with the current state of the art alternatives. We also deployed an online demonstration with publicly available studies. 5 Available at: http://demo.dicoogle.com, in the pathology menu. 5 4.1 Storage Regarding the required storage space to hold WSI studies, our interest lays in knowing how the DICOM format influences this variable, especially when compared to other formats. We used a dataset composed of 100 WSI studies collected by a major vendor scanner. The images were stored in DICOM WSI format, encoded with JPEG lossy compression (factor 85). Sub-resolution images were also supplied by the scanner. The maximum resolution images of this dataset have a combined size of 13.9GB. Together with the sub-resolution images, the dataset amounts to 19.4GB. Regarding the image dimensions, the largest images have 26 GPixels, while the lowest image resolution is 16 MPixels. For validation purposes, the studies were replicated in other formats, namely Pyramidal TIFF, JPEG2000 Lossy (factor 85) and JPEG2000 Lossless. The JPEG2000 images were generated using JVSDicom Compressor with parameters recommended in [30]. These parameters are supposed to enable better visualization of the WSIs. Table 1 shows a comparison of the required storage space for the multiple image formats. For simplicity reasons, only the values of the five largest images are shown, together with the mean and standard deviation values for the whole dataset. By analyzing Table 1, it is possible to conclude that TIFF pyramids are on average 94% the size of the same image stored in DICOM. This was expected due to the amount of important metadata stored alongside the DICOM images, which is not shipped in the TIFF files. Another conclusion drawn from this table is that JPEG2000 reversible compression tends to generate very large files when compared with irreversible JPEG compression (factor=85) of the DICOM pyramids. These images are on average 3 times the size of the reference for this study. Finally, comparing the DICOM image pyramids with the best JPEG2000 irreversible compression parameters, we found that on average the images produced are 43% the size of our reference. We think that such a figure is relevant in the context of an institutional PACS, since it represents meaningful storage savings. However, as will become clear in this document, this saving in storage space will come at the expense of performance in the visualization process, which is a negative effect. 4.2 Visualization Performance in image visualization is of paramount importance for any digital pathology laboratory since it influences directly the quality of service perceived by pathologists. Therefore, it is crucial to validate the proposed architecture on this point, as well as comparing its performance with the previous alternatives described in this document. In order to assess our architecture\u2019s content discovery and retrieval capabilities, we elaborated a trial to evaluate how quickly images could be presented to the user. This consists of executing a predefined workflow on the viewer application. A workflow with seven tasks was designed for each image. The tasks, shown below, reflect common operations performed by users and require additional data to be retrieved from the image server. 1. Open the image. 2. Zoom to 10x in the current position (center). 3. Pan to a point \u2018a\u2019. 4. Zoom to 20x centered on point \u2018a\u2019. 5. Pan to point \u2018b\u2019. 6. Zoom to 40x centered on point \u2018b\u2019. 7. Pan to point \u2018c\u2019. The time required for the application to fulfill each task was measured. This process involved displaying the image regions in their highest quality. We submitted two viewers to this trial, the solution proposed here and JVSView, which was selected because it was presented in the literature as the best solution using JPEG2000 and JPIP, namely in [30]. Consequently, we can establish a comparison between the performance of a fully DICOM architecture, and its JPEG2000 & JPIP counterpart. Both applications and servers were deployed on the same computer (Intel Core i7-3770 CPU, 16GB DDR3 RAM, and a 7200rpm hard-drive), and the same monitor and resolution were used by both applications. Table 2 provides the output of this trial as well as the speed-up provided by our architecture. The results show that the proposed solution has significant performance gains. For anyone using both applications, this perception is immediate due to the usability discrepancy between them. The proposed architecture managed to complete the workflow on average 18x faster than its counterpart. A key factor is that it managed to complete every task in less than 2s, which we think is a manageable waiting period for a reviewing pathologist. In the previous experiments, the time required for retrieving each tile from the proposed Pathology PACS archive was also recorded. On average, each tile was loaded in 20ms, with a standard deviation of 15ms. We estimate that the proposed viewer is capable of loading around 50 tiles per second, which corresponds to an area of 3620 square pixels. This area is larger than the high-resolution 4K displays which are expected to improve the WSI screening efficiency [38]. Those are interesting values that validate the content retrieval capabilities of a solution based on standard DICOM services. Moreover, the improvements in the visualization process and image distribution completely compensate for the greater storage space requirements. 5 Conclusion This article proposes, describes and validates a PACS architecture for supporting digital pathology and whole-slide imaging along with the remaining modalities of medical imaging. The architecture resorts uniquely to the DICOM standard, both for communications and data format, and the proposed components were designed with a special focus on efficiency and usability. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at building such a functional architecture. The performance challenges raised by whole-slide imaging and the idea that DICOM services could not be used to efficiently support these scenarios were the most likely causes for this gap in the state of the art. However, this article demonstrates that a standard PACS-DICOM solution is capable of achieving better performance than common proprietary solutions based on JPEG2000. Moreover, the solution is also compliant with current web application requirements, using pure Web technologies and paradigms that make it suitable to support tele-pathology services.

The literature reports significant advantages associated with the adoption of digital images in pathology, namely, improvements in diagnostic accuracy and better support for telepathology. Moreover, it also offers new clinical and research applications. However, numerous barriers have been slowing the adoption of WSI, among which the most important are performance issues associated with storage and distribution of huge volumes of data, and lack of interoperability with other hospital information systems, most notably Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) based on the DICOM standard. This article proposes an architecture of a Web Pathology PACS fully compliant with DICOM standard communications and data formats. The solution includes a PACS Archive responsible for storing whole-slide imaging data in DICOM WSI format and offers a communication interface based on the most recent DICOM Web services. The second component is a zero-footprint viewer that runs in any web-browser. It consumes data using the PACS archive standard web services. Moreover, it features a tiling engine especially suited to deal with the WSI image pyramids. These components were designed with special focus on efficiency and usability. The performance of our system was assessed through a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions. The results demonstrate that it is possible to have a very competitive solution based on standard workflows.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate": "2017-07-31", "openaccessUserLicense":
