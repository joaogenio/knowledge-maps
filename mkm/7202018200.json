For this purpose, we developed new procedures to identify symmetric word pairs with uncommon empirical distance distribution and with clusters of overrepresented short distances. We speculate that patterns of overrepresentation of short distances between symmetric word pairs may allow the occurrence of non-standard DNA conformations, such as hairpin/cruciform structures. We focused on the human genome, and analysed both the complete genome as well as a version with known repetitive sequences masked out. We reported several well-defined features in the distributions of distances, which can be classified into three different profiles, showing enrichment in distinct distance ranges. We analysed in greater detail certain pairs of symmetric words of length seven, found by our procedure, characterised by the surprising fact that they occur at single distances more frequently than expected.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2016 Royal Statistical SocietySymbolic or categorical sequences occur in many contexts and can be characterized, for example, by integer-valued intersymbol distances or binary-valued indicator sequences. The analysis of these numerical sequences often sheds light on the properties of the original symbolic sequences. This work introduces new statistical tools for exploring auto-correlation structure in the indicator sequences, for the specific case of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. It is known that the probability distribution of internucleotide distances of DNA sequences deviates significantly from the distribution obtained by assuming independent random placement (i.e. the geometric distribution) and that the deviations can be used either to discriminate between species or to build phylogenetic trees. To investigate the extent to which auto-correlation structure explains these deviations, the 0–1 indicator sequence of each nucleotide (A, C, G and T) is endowed with a binary auto-regressive (AR) model of optimum order. The corresponding binary AR geometric distribution is derived analytically and compared with the observed internucleotide distance distribution by appropriate goodness-of-fit testing. Results in 34 mitochondrial DNA sequences show that the hypothesis of equal observed/expected frequencies is seldom rejected when a binary AR model is considered instead of independence (76/136 versus 125/136 rejections at the 1% level), in spite of χ2 -testing tending to reject for large samples, regardless of how close observed/expected values are. Furthermore, binary AR structure also leads to a median discrepancy reduction of 90% for G, 80% for C, 60% for T and 30% for nucleotide A. Therefore, these models are useful to describe the dependences within a given nucleotide and encourage the development of a model-based framework to compact internucleotide distance information and to understand DNA differences among species further.",

Their discovery is important, because they allow the localization of evolutionary traits that are often related to novel functionalities and, sometimes, diseases. We have detected distinct DNA regions specific in the modern human, when compared to a Neanderthal high-quality genome sequence obtained from a bone of a Siberian woman. The bone is around 50,000 years old and the DNA raw data totalizes more than 418 GB. Since the data size required for localizing efficiently such events is very high, it is not practical to store the model on a table or hash table. Thus, we propose a probabilistic method to map and visualize those regions. The time complexity of the method is linear. The computational tool is available at http://pratas.github.io/chester. The results, computed in approximately two days using a single CPU core, show several regions with documented neanderthal absent regions, namely genes associated with the brain (neurotransmiters and synapses), hearing, blood, fertility and the immune system. However, it also shows several undocumented regions, that may express new functions linked with the evolution of the modern human.",

This compressor uses a mixture of context models of several orders, according to two model classes: reference and target. A new type of context model, which is capable of tolerating substitution errors, is introduced. For ensuring flexibility regarding hardware specifications, the compressor uses cache-hashes in high order models.

Specially in wide-field microscopy, there is a strong out-of-focus blur in focal plane direction, caused mainly by a frequency loss in the acquisition process. In order to restore these images it is important to use non-linear methods and relevant prior knowledge as constraints. In this paper, we propose a projection onto convex sets framework using a sequence of prototype images inspired by the Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm. Within this framework it is possible to use constraints while restoring the image, during the iterations. We prove that the iterative method can be implemented as a gradient iteration, followed by a sequence of projections onto constraint sets. Moreover, we performed experiments using the techniques in order to improve restoration. The results showed a better restoration of frequencies, an improved focal plane restoration and a better contrast when compared with the regular iterative restoration algorithm.",

Tel.: +351 232480500; fax: +351 232424651. In this paper we present an indoor acoustics simulator that is able to deal with high bandwidth ultrasonic signals. The simulator can handle the multiple reflections present in a room, which could be produced by the room walls and by the objects inside it. Moreover, it takes into account the transducer’s beam patterns as well as the ultrasonic wave propagation losses. Additionally the simulator may be used to simulate the Doppler effect for any type of movement. The simulator was implemented using Matlab and is freely available, so that it can be easily modified by the user. Field tests have shown that the simulator is very accurate, turning it into a valuable tool to study and compare different ultrasonic pulses or ultrasonic location systems under controlled conditions. Keywords Ultrasonic signals Acoustic simulator Impulse response Ultrasonic reflection Doppler effect 1 Introduction An ultrasonic (US) room simulator is a valuable tool to study and compare the performance of different location algorithms and acoustic pulses in a controlled environment. By using a simulator it is very easy to change the parameters that affect the response of the acoustic system and to test extreme situations that are not easy to replicate in the real field. Moreover, it is much faster to use a simulator than to setup and carry out real field tests in order to test different algorithms and ultrasonic signals under the same circumstances. Commercially available acoustic simulators, like Ramsete, ODEON or CATT-Acoustic, are very expensive and complex and since they are not open source, changes are not possible [1]. However, there are examples of freely available simulators, [2–4] but they are implemented to simulate very specific situations, most of them in the audible range. Moreover, the majority of them do not take into account the Doppler effect or implement it for very simple situations such as uniform movement. Note that the Doppler effect has a considerably stronger impact on US signals than on radio-frequency (RF), as it will be seen in Section 5. Indoor ultrasonic acoustic propagation presents problems similar to those experienced in electromagnetic waves propagation, such as multiple reflections, Doppler effect and propagation attenuation [4,5]. Due to these problems, a good model for the ultrasonic channel is needed in order to properly design ultrasonic communication or location systems. The proposed simulator is based on changing and simplifying some techniques that were used in the acoustics and radio-frequency fields. The approach presented here allows to produce a very fast and easy to use simulator to evaluate and compare different ultrasonic location systems and ultrasonic communication pulses. 2 Simulator architecture The problem that we want to address is schematically presented in Fig. 1 . Each source s receives an electric signal x s ( n ) and transforms it into an acoustic wave that travels through the Room Channel. Moreover, this Room Channel represents a room where the acoustic waves can propagate and reflect in the walls before arriving at the receiver position. Therefore, the receiver block combines each received wave into the signal y ( n ) . The simulator architecture can be represented by the block diagram of Fig. 2 , where h s ( n ) represents the impulse response (IR) that simulates the effect of the transducer and the acoustic channel on the input signal x s ( n ) . This approach brings the first two simplifications to the models to be used in the simulator: 1. all signals are digital and therefore discrete (time and value); 2. the source, the receiver and the room effects are considered linear (represented by an IR). At the end the simulator provides to the user the IRs for each individual source s , h s ( n ) . The user may compute a set of impulse responses at different receiver’s positions and compare the effect of each source and input signal x s ( n ) in the received signal y ( n ) . Each h s ( n ) can be decomposed in three main IRs which represent the effect of the source, t s ( n ) , the receiver, r s ( n ) , and the sound propagation, p s ( n ) , see Fig. 3 . The source s IR, t s ( n ) , models the effect of the transmission chain (sound card; cables; amplifier; speaker; etc.), in other words, it models all the path from the digital world up to the acoustic wave generated by the speaker. In contrast, the receiver IR, r s ( n ) , models the effect of the reception chain (microphone; amplifier; cables; sound card; etc.), in other words, it simulates the path from the received acoustic wave by the microphone up to the digital world. Finally, the sound propagation IR, p s ( n ) , models the acoustic wave propagation in a specific room for a pair of receiver and source positions (attenuation; distance delay; etc). 2.1 Transmitter/receiver model In order to obtain the source and the receiver IR two approaches can be employed. If the hardware manufacturer gives the IR (or frequency response) of their components, then it will be possible to obtain the IR for all the chain. If not, measuring the IR of the system with calibrated hardware could be the only way. Note that, for a complete hardware description (e.g.: speaker and microphone) IR measures for each azimuth and elevation angle must be obtained. However, this needs to be carried out just once because the measured IR are considered to be independent of the room conditions. Both IR must be provided to the simulator, a source IR for a given source output direction and a receiver IR for a given receiver input direction. The receiver or the source direction is defined by the azimuth angle θ, and the elevation angle ϕ as presented in Fig. 4 . 2.2 Sound propagation model This is the most crucial element of the simulator. However, it is not possible to measure the IR for all the ambient conditions and for all possible source/receiver distances, being impractical to model the sound propagation by applying the same approach used for the source and the receiver. Therefore, the proposed simulator, uses a physic based model instead of a statistically based model [1,6,7]. In contrast to the statistically based models the physic based models allow to simulate the behavior of a system in a particular room or in a particular situation. In order to reduce the simulation time and the user intervention some approximations and simplifications were made in the sound propagation model, wherever possible, without compromising the closeness to reality. On that account, the simulator incorporates the following simplifications and specifications, that will be detailed later: 1. The room ambient conditions (temperature, pressure and humidity) are constant over time and space. 2. The wave propagation attenuates due only to dispersion and energy absorption and it is considered to be a function of the signal frequency. 3. The wind effect and the gradients of temperature were not taken into account. The sound speed, c, depends on temperature, pressure and density of the air [8]. Nevertheless, at typical room conditions, the sound speed may be assumed to be independent of small pressure and density variations [8]. Therefore, c can be written only as a function of the temperature: (1) c = 331.5641 T 273.15 + 1 (m/s) where T is the air temperature in °C. This speed implies that the ultrasonic wave takes some time to travel the distance, d, from the source up to the receiver. Due to the need to accurately simulate this delay, the input signal x s ( n ) may need to be delayed by a non integer number of sampling periods. For that reason, Lagrange fractional delay filters [9] were used to simulate the fractional delay. The choice of this particular type of filters relies on the fact that they produce a finite IR, L D ( n ) , that can be easily integrated with the other IRs of the simulator. Furthermore, they were also chosen because their filter coefficients can be readily updated by a close-form equation [9] given by: (2) L D ( n ) = ∏ m = 0 m ≠ n M D - m n - m , where D is a real number that represents the filter delay and M the filter order. Lagrange fractional delay filters only operate properly for frequencies up to a quarter or a third of the sampling frequency, depending on the filter order, which can be pointed out as the main Lagrange fractional delay filter’s disadvantage [9]. For that reason, the simulator must use a sampling rate around four times higher than the maximum frequency of the signal in order to reduce the delay and amplitude errors. Considering that the majority of the ultrasonic transducers manufacturers only provide the pressure amplitude, P 0 , at a certain known distance d 0 and ultrasonic waves propagate as spherical waves [8], as shown in Fig. 5 , the pressure amplitude at distance d (in meters) relates with P 0 as: (3) P ( d ) = d 0 d × P 0 . This equation only takes into account the wave attenuation due to dispersion. However, in [10], it is pointed out that the propagation losses in ultrasonic frequencies have a strong impact in the wave attenuation, especially for distances above a few meters. This attenuation can be expressed as [10]: (4) P ( d ) = P 0 × 10 - α ( d - d 0 ) 20 where α is the air absorption coefficient in dB/m and it can be computed by the 9613-1 ISO norm [11] using only parameters easily obtained, such as, the temperature, the pressure, frequency and relative humidity. Combining the attenuation due to dispersion (3) and due to propagation losses (4), the resultant acoustic wave pressure amplitude at distance d (in meters) is given by: (5) P ( d ) = P 0 × d 0 d × 10 - α ( d - d 0 ) 20 . As the result of considering that the room ambient conditions are constant over the simulation, the absorption coefficient in air is only a function of the wave frequency f. Therefore, the atmospheric attenuation faced by an ultrasonic wave at d meters from the source is given by: (6) A T ( d , f ) = d 0 d × 10 - α ( f ) ( d - d 0 ) 20 As a result of this, the A T ( d , f ) will be only a function of the wave frequency f for a fixed distance d and therefore can be considered as a linear filter, which results into an impulse response, a ( n ) . To exemplify the process used in the simulator to obtain the impulse response a ( n ) , a receiver at 4m from the source and the following ambient conditions: a temperature of 20°C; a relative humidity of 30%; and a pressure of 1atm was considered. Under this constraints the total attenuation in air, A T ( 4 , f ) , is depicted in Fig. 6 . Our approach to obtain the A T ( d , f ) IR is to use the inverse Fourier transform. Which leads us to an infinite impulse response. Therefore, the resultant IR must be truncated in order to obtain an IR with only a few samples. Fig. 7 presents the IR with 64 samples obtained by this process for the example presented in Fig. 6, it also shows the error produced in the frequency domain. Note that this IR must be delayed due to causality however this delay can be easily subtracted from the total delay resulted from propagation (in this example the IR must be delayed of 32 samples which represents a distance of around 5.5cm for a sampling frequency of 200kHz). We can see in Fig. 7b that the resultant error is very low, moreover it can be considerably reduced by increasing the IR length. However, this approach will increase the minimum distance between the source and the receiver that can be simulated. Nevertheless, the error can be reduced if we discard the frequency response accuracy in some of the frequency components, for example in the audible range (up to 20kHz). In order to increase the accuracy of the frequency response in one part of the spectrum while giving up elsewhere, we can use the algorithm presented in Fig. 8 based on the Papoulis–Gerchberg algorithm [12,13]. The algorithm starts by computing the total attenuation frequency response A T ( d , f ) using (6) in K frequency points f k , obtaining the discrete Fourier transform A ( k ) , Note that, the frequency points f k must be computed for the discrete Fourier transform bins, moreover the number of frequency points K must be greater than the desired IR length L to ensure proper frequency response interpolation. After that, the IR a i ( n ) is computed by the inverse discrete Fourier transform of A i ( k ) , resulting into a length K IR. The IR a i ( n ) is then truncated using a rectangular window w L ( n ) with length L and the corresponding frequency response is computed using the discrete Fourier transform. This process is repeated until the error in the desired band B is less than a given value ∊. At the beginning of each iteration the frequency points in the desired band B of A i ( k ) are restored to the proper values A ( B ) . By using the proposed algorithm it is possible to considerably reduce the error for a predetermined band. Using the same example and applying the algorithm to the band from 20kHz to 50kHz and running it one hundred times, it is possible to increase the accuracy of the total attenuation frequency response ten times for the same IR length (see Fig. 9 ). 2.3 Surfaces model For the surface modeling (e.g.: walls, floor and objects) the simulator uses a polygonal based modeling, widely used in 3D computer graphics [14]. Due to the typical geometric shape of the room surfaces we chose quadrilaterals instead of the conventional triangles as the basic element. Therefore, most of the room surfaces can be represented by making use of only one quadrilateral. However, some of them must be represented has a group of quadrilaterals connected to each other to form a particular geometric shape. Furthermore, many of the room models produced by specific software are based in polygonal modeling which may be easily adapted to be used into the simulator. Nevertheless, this type of geometry considerably simplifies the process of computing the surface reflections. However, to properly model curved surfaces, it is necessary to use a huge number of quadrilaterals. 2.4 Multiple reflections model At this point, it is possible to model the transmission, propagation and reception chain using separate impulse responses and without considering the reflections. As a result of this, it is already possible to properly model the direct path from the sent signal x s ( n ) to the received signal y s ( n ) . Moreover, it is also possible to represent all the surfaces in the room that may produce wave reflections. Therefore, all the main requirements to introduce the reflections into the simulator are fulfilled. However, the theory of sound propagation in closed spaces can be very hard to apply and model and it may bring an important drawback associated to it: the computation time. Nevertheless, ultrasonic waves have a huge advantage when compared to sound, which is that its maximum wave length is about 1.7cm (for 20kHz). As most of the obstacles usually present in a room are larger that this wavelength, we can consider only specular reflections. Moreover, the ultrasonic scattering energy is very low when compared to scattering energy in the audible range. Due to its complexity, it was also discarded by the simulator. These simplifications considerably reduce the simulation time and the user intervention without compromising the closeness to reality. On that account, the simulator presents the following characteristics and specifications: 1. It is considered that the sound will propagate along sound rays. 2. All possible reflections up to a predefined order are computed and they are considered to be only specular in a plane surface with a specific IR (previously measured) associated to it. Diffraction and scattering are ignored due to its modeling and computational complexity. 3. All the possible received sound rays are subsequently validated by applying the ray-tracing method. When an ultrasonic wave is emitted in a common room, the wave travels radially in all directions. When this wave finds an obstacle (e.g. a wall), the propagation direction changes and the ultrasonic wave reflects on the obstacle [8]. However to simulate the ultrasonic propagation it is better to consider that it travels like rays and the wave front is flat [15]. In other words, the ultrasonic wave behaves, in the presence of an object, as a ray of light behaves in the presence of a mirror. This means that it is possible to apply the well known Snell Law, from the optics theory, to determine the reflection wave direction (7) θ i = θ r . It is important to notice that, in the simulator, the transmitted wave is discarded due to its low energy, therefore it is considered that the transmitted wave is completely absorbed by the object [15]. For most of the solid materials (e.g. wood, metal, plastic, glass, etc.) the reflected wave has almost the same energy as the incident wave. Nevertheless, some soft materials in a common room can absorb some wave energy and consequently the reflected wave has less energy than the incident wave (e.g. carpets, cork, curtains, etc.). In addiction to these, if the energy lost in the reflection depends on the frequency of the incident wave, an IR of the wall reflection must be considered. Nevertheless, similar to what happens with the source and the receiver, this has to be carried out only once and it is considered to be independent of the room conditions. In order to model the reflection in the surfaces there are two classical geometric methods: the Ray Tracing Method and the Image Source Method [16]. In both methods, the accuracy increases as the frequency increases and they present very good results for high audible frequencies [16]. Therefore, at the ultrasonic range it is expected that they produce very accurate results. An hybrid method that combines the Ray-Tracing Method and the Virtual Sources Method was used in the simulator. Firstly, all the virtual sources are created and then each incoming ray is validated by using the ray-tracing method. 3 Implementation The implementation of the simulator was carried out in Matlab. 1 Matlab is a numerical computing environment developed by MathWorks, it allows the implementation of complex algorithms providing several tools to reduce the implementation time. 1 Since Matlab is proprietary software an effort was made, during the simulator implementation, to only use typical Matlab functions that can be found in several compatible freeware packages (such as GNU Octave 2 GNU Octave is a freeware software very similar to Matlab and most of the algorithms implemented in Matlab can be run in GNU Octave without almost any changes. 2 ). This way, the implemented simulator can be used almost for free. Moreover, this tool will allow the user to have complete control over the simulation and to understand its behavior. The simulator was implemented as a modular program in order to simplify the implementation of future extensions and the substitution of code by any user. The modular structure allows the user to easily modify any module in order to obtain the desired behavior. The simulator can be divided into six different modules and six different methods for interaction between the modules. A module can be a simple data structure or a complex object depending on its goal. The methods are designed to obtain the information from the modules and/or create new modules. The interaction between the different modules and methods is schematically represented in Fig. 10 . 3.1 Walls array module The Walls_Array module is a simple data structure that contains the information of each surface of the room. Each surface in the array is represented by a reflection coefficient and by the four edges of the quadrilateral as discussed previously in Section 2.4. This module is created and modified by the Add_Wall method, which creates the array and fills it with the data. 3.2 Transfer function module The Transfer_Func module is an object that, for a particular source or receiver, outputs to the user the IR for a given azimuth and elevation angle. Depending on the origin of the information this module can have different implementations, however, this must me transparent to the user. In the present simulator implementation, this module needs three inputs: – the direction: ( θ , ϕ ) ; – the operation frequency band: B ; – the sampling frequency: f s . From these inputs the module provides two outputs: – the impulse response: t s ( n ) or r s ( n ) ; – the index of the IR’s first sample. This module is used by the Add_Source and Add_Receiver methods. 3.3 Sources array module The Sources_Array module is a simple data structure that contains the information of each source placed in the room. Each source in the array is represented by: – the position in the room ( x , y , z ) coordinates; – the direction in Cartesian coordinates ( e x , e y , e z ); – the Transfer_Func module associated to the source. This module is created and modified by the Add_Source method, which creates the array and fills it with the data. 3.4 Room representation file module The Room_File module is a simple data structure stored in a file that contains: – the information of all the room surfaces; – all the sources in the room (real and virtual). This module is created by the Get_Room method, which by processing the Walls_Array and the Sources_Array modules can create the file and fill it with the data for a maximum reflection order given by the user. This module has a specific method to show graphically the information stored in the file: the Display_Room method. Fig. 11 presents two example outputs of this method. In Fig. 11a the room without reflections is presented and therefore only the real source marked with a circle is shown. Fig. 11b presents the same example but considering a maximum of three successive reflections. The virtual sources, that produce the reflections are marked with a light gray circles and the real source with a dark gray circle. Note that, this file is independent of the room ambient conditions and the receiver position. Therefore, the resultant file can be used for any room ambient conditions and for any receiver position without the need to create it again. 3.5 Receiver module The Receiver module is similar to the Sources_Array module. The biggest difference is that it only has one receiver instead of having an array of them. Therefore, the data structure contains: – the position in the room ( x , y , z ) coordinates; – the direction in Cartesian coordinates ( e x , e y , e y ); – the receiver Transfer_Func module. This module has a creator method, Add_Receiver, which creates it and fills it with the data. 3.6 Propagation module The Propagation module is an object that for particular ambient conditions provides the user with the IR for a given distance between the source and the receiver. This IR only takes into account the ultrasonic wave attenuation presented in Section 2.2. In the present simulator, the implementation of this module needs the following inputs: – the distance between the source and the receiver; – the room temperature, humidity and pressure; – the operation frequency band, B ; – the sampling frequency, f s . From these inputs the module provides the following outputs: – the impulse response, a ( n ) ; – the index of the IR’s first sample (causality problem). 3.7 Get impulse response method The Get_Impulse method is the most complex method in the simulator due to the fact that it collects and combines all the information from other modules (Room_File, Receiver and Propagation) to compute the IR from each source, h s ( n ) . In the first stage, by using the Receiver module, it validates all the sources (real and virtual) in the Room_File module. For each valid source, it obtains the source output direction and the receiver input direction. It computes the total attenuation due the reflection coefficient of each surface and the total traveling distance. In the second stage, it computes the IR from the Transfer_Func module of the source, t s ( n ) , the IR from the Transfer_Func module of the receiver, r s ( n ) , and the IR from the Propagation module, a ( n ) . At the end it groups together all the sources that represent the same real source and computes the resultant impulse response for each real source, h s ( n ) . 4 Performance To evaluate the simulator performance several simulations were carried out, in the same computer, with different parameters. For these tests a computer with the characteristics presented in Table 1 was used. In order to minimize external interference from other programs running in the computer, the Matlab process priority was set to High. In addition to this, at least 10 trials were carried out for each test. 4.1 Room complexity impact In this test, the simulation time was measured using one to twelve surfaces and considering a maximum of one to five successive reflections. The simulation times are presented in Fig. 12 . From this figure it can be seen that the simulation time is approximately exponential with the number of surfaces (>3) in the room for any number of maximum successive reflections. Considering three maximum successive reflections the simulation time starts at about 2ms for three surfaces and goes up to 50ms. Another important point is that the simulation time increases considerably with the maximum number of successive reflections. It starts around 2ms for one reflection and ends at 20s for five reflections for a room with twelve surfaces. Nevertheless, for the majority of the ultrasonic applications, a maximum of three or four successive reflections is more than enough to present good results. 4.2 Number of sources impact In this test, the simulation time was measured using one to three sources and considering a maximum successive reflection number of one to six. The results from this test are presented in Fig. 13 . From this figure it can be seen that the simulation time is approximately exponential with the number of reflections and is approximately linear with the number of sources. These results are consistent with the previous test and the simulator implementation, where each source is treated separately and independently. 5 Simulating the Doppler effect The Doppler effect is produced by the receiver and/or source movement. Moreover, the Doppler effect can be characterized by a compression or expansion of the acoustic signal, in the time domain, proportional to the source/receiver relative speed [7]. The Doppler effect has a stronger impact on ultrasonic propagation than in electromagnetic wave propagation due to the lower speed of sound. For example, a person traveling at 1m/s produces a maximum Doppler shift [7] of 118Hz on a 40kHz carrier. For FM radio reception to have an equivalent Doppler shift, the person needs to travel at more than 330m/s (1188km/h). The Doppler effect can be simulated by resampling the channel impulse response over time. Therefore, the impulse response will be different for each instant n: (8) h s ( n , m ) = h s ( n ) ( m ) where the h s ( n ) ( m ) is the impulse response h s ( m ) for the instant n for source s. Fig. 14 presents the block diagram of the Doppler effect implementation in the simulator. For each instant n the source and the receiver position must be determined and the IR must be computed using the simulator. After that the IR can be applied to the input signal x ( n ) to obtain the output sample y ( n ) . For instant n + 1 the source and the receiver position must be updated in the simulator and a new IR must computed and applied to x ( n + 1 ) to obtain the output sample y ( n + 1 ) . As a result of this, for each output sample an IR must be computed with the simulator which leads to a extremely high computation time. However, it produces a very accurate result with multiple reflections and it can be applied to any kind of movement and room scenarios. 6 Simulator results The system measurement chain presented in Fig. 15 will be used to perform the practical tests. The distance between the microphone and the speaker could be fixed or variable depending on the type of measurement. An PC with Matlab was used to receive and process the ultrasonic waves and to communicate with the data acquisition hardware, namely the DT9836S-6-2-BNC from Data Translation. The Brüel & Kjær 4954-A microphone was used to receive the ultrasonic signals, it is calibrated, operates up to 100kHz and its manufacture provides a well-known frequency response. The speaker that was used is a Kemo L10 (see Fig. 16 a), which has an excellent frequency response between 15kHz and 45kHz, nevertheless it can produce waves up to 80kHz, as can be seen in Fig. 16b. 6.1 Single reflection To test the simulator behavior a very simple example with a single reflection will be described. The simulator impulse response will be compared with the real impulse response obtained under similar circumstances. Fig. 17 shows the scheme of the measurement setup system used. The microphone and the source were placed at fixed positions at 1.45m from the floor and 5.5m apart. An environment as similar as possible to the real one was created in the simulator. The real impulse response was obtained by correlation. The resultant IR is compared in Fig. 18 with the impulse response obtained by the simulator. One can see that the impulse responses are very similar, proving that the simulator presents a very high degree of similarity to the real environment described in Fig. 17. 6.2 Simulation of a complex room In order to test the simulator in a complex room, the room environment presented in Fig. 19 was used. The room has the following external dimensions 6×10×3m and in the middle of the room there is a 3m long wall. The walls and the ceiling are made of medium-density fiberboard (MDF) and the floor of concrete. The speaker was placed in the inside wall corner, near the ceiling pointing in the direction of the room corner (3, 0, 0) as shown in Fig. 20 . The impulse response was measured in five different places in the room, as presented in Fig. 20, at 1.5m from the floor. A measuring tape was used to set the positions of the microphone. Therefore the microphone position presents errors of the order of a centimeter. The first four points are inside the same room division of the speaker and the last point is out of the speaker’s line-of-sight. Nevertheless, this point can receive reflected waves from walls. The results for this five points are presented in Fig. 21 , where the left column presents the impulse response obtained from the simulator and the right column the real impulse response obtained by correlation. In spite of some differences, especially in the impulses amplitude, it can be said that the impulse response obtained in the simulator matches very well the impulse response obtained in the field. A careful analysis of the results reveals that the main echos of the simulator IR (the ones with a considerable amplitude in comparison to the direct wave) have a similar amplitude and arrive at the same time that the ones in the real IR. The amplitude difference could be related to some reflection coefficient difference over the wall material and the roughness of the concrete floor. Another important issue that the simulator does not take it into account can be observed in the results for P 5, which is the ultrasonic propagation through wall. In P 5 all the impulse response spikes before 25ms are related to ultrasonic waves that cross the inside wall. The distance between the speaker and the microphone is around 2.55m resulting into a 7.5ms time delay therefore the first spike in the real IR arises from the direct path. Nevertheless, these small differences do not compromise the realism of the simulator, on the other hand, they reinforce the idea that the simulator is a very important tool to estimate the ultrasonic signal propagation in a particular room. 6.3 Doppler effect To test the Doppler effect a receiver moving with an uniform and circular movement was used. For that purpose the simulation setup shown in Fig. 22 was used. In this setup there are six surfaces with a reflection coefficient of 0.5 (four walls, floor and ceiling), the floor was placed at z = - 1 m and the ceiling at z = 2 m. The receiver performs a circular movement with constant speed of 10m/s and 2m of radius. Moreover, to evaluate and understand the reflections impact, the receiver makes two complete turns, which takes around 2.51s, in the first turn the simulator considers no reflection and in the second turn the simulator considers a maximum of three successive reflections. The source was placed at 1m from the coordinate system origin in (0; - 1 ; 0) and its direction was set to the y coordinate. The same speaker of the previous tests (Fig. 16a) was used. As a consequence of the source position, the relative speed will change with time according to Fig. 23 which presents a speed variation of ±5m/s. Fig. 24 a presents the Doppler effect on a single sinusoidal signal, Fig. 24b on a signal composed by 5 sinusoidal signals and Fig. 24c on a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulated signal. When multiple reflections are introduced, the resultant signal will be a mixture of different sinusoids with different frequencies due to reflected waves arriving to the receiver with different relative speeds. At 10m/s this mixture can have sinusoids with frequencies shifts in the range of ±840Hz for 29kHz, ±870Hz for 30kHz and ±900Hz for 31kHz due to the Doppler effect. This effect can be seen in Fig. 24a where the signal frequency changes between 29.13kHz and 30.87kHz and Fig. 24b where the signal frequency changes between 28.16kHz and 31.90kHz. Doppler effect was not compared with field tests due to the complexity of the setup, the measuring process and the lack of specific hardware. 7 Conclusion and future work This paper describes the design and implementation of an ultrasonic room simulator with the following characteristics: – designed for wideband ultrasonic signals; – the signal bandwidth can be specified in order to improve its accuracy within that band; – takes into account the air attenuation and losses by providing the desired room ambient conditions, such as, temperature and humidity; – any type of flat surface can be implemented and its reflections can be modeled through an IR; – makes use of the speaker and/or microphone beam patterns; – simulates multiple signal sources at the same time; – simulates the Doppler effect for any type of movement. On the other hand it presents the following limitations: – only computes the reflections up to a certain order, initially specified by the user; – does not take into account gradients of temperature nor wind effects; – discards the wave propagation through the walls (transmitted wave); – only simulates a single receiver at a time; – rounded surfaces are difficult to model; – the simulation of Doppler effect is a time consuming process. The results presented in Section 6 show that the models used in the simulator are valid, very accurate and realist. The implemented simulator is already in a mature state with acceptable performance and good accuracy. However, there are several points that can be improved both in terms of performance and accuracy. In the present version of the simulator the virtual source validation by ray tracing takes more than half of the total simulation time for some configurations and therefore this is a key point to address in order to improve the performance. Another important point is the user interface, which forces the user to know how to use Matlab. Therefore some work could be done in this field making the simulator more user friendly. In the simulator, the room is implemented by setting all the surfaces coordinates, which can make the room definition very time consuming. Consequently, the simulator integration with other simple and intuitive room design software (like SketchUp 3 SketchUp from Trimble is one of the most popular and used 3D modeling tools, it was created to be used not only by professionals but also by amateurs with no knowledge in 3D modeling. 3 ) will simplify the room implementation process. From the accuracy point of view, it will be important to take into account the time and space variation of some of the ambient variables. Another important point in the accuracy field, especially for low US frequencies is the propagation waves through the room surfaces.

The aim of this study was to assess tick infestation patterns in birds in Portugal and the prevalence of tick infection by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. using PCR techniques.Seven tick species were collected from birds including Haemaphysalis punctata, Hyalomma spp., Ixodes acuminatus, Ixodes arboricola, Ixodes frontalis, Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes ventalloi. We found that I. frontalis and Hyalomma spp. were the most common ticks infesting birds of several species and that they were widespread in Portugal. Turdus merula was the bird species that presented the highest diversity of infesting ticks and had one of the highest infestation intensities.B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 7.3% (37/505) of Ixodidae ticks derived from birds. The most common genospecies was Borrelia turdi (6.9%), detected in ticks collected from Parus major, T. merula and Turdus philomelos, but Borrelia valaisiana (0.2%) and one Borrelia sp. (0.2%) similar to Borrelia bissettii (96% of similarity of the flaB gene in Blastn) were also detected.This study contributed to a better knowledge of the Ixodidae tick fauna parasitizing birds in Western Europe and to the assessment of the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. associated with birds and their ticks.",

Wild birds may act as reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens and may be mechanical carriers of pathogen infected vector ticks through long distances during migration. The aim of this study was to assess tick infestation patterns in birds in Portugal and the prevalence of tick infection by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. using PCR techniques. Seven tick species were collected from birds including Haemaphysalis punctata, Hyalomma spp., Ixodes acuminatus, Ixodes arboricola, Ixodes frontalis, Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes ventalloi. We found that I. frontalis and Hyalomma spp. were the most common ticks infesting birds of several species and that they were widespread in Portugal. Turdus merula was the bird species that presented the highest diversity of infesting ticks and had one of the highest infestation intensities. B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 7.3% (37/505) of Ixodidae ticks derived from birds. The most common genospecies was Borrelia turdi (6.9%), detected in ticks collected from Parus major, T. merula and Turdus philomelos, but Borrelia valaisiana (0.2%) and one Borrelia sp. (0.2%) similar to Borrelia bissettii (96% of similarity of the flaB gene in Blastn) were also detected. This study contributed to a better knowledge of the Ixodidae tick fauna parasitizing birds in Western Europe and to the assessment of the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. associated with birds and their ticks. Keywords B. turdi B. bissettii Ixodes sp. Hyalomma sp. Birds Portugal Introduction Ticks are ubiquitous ectoparasites of vertebrates and are considered the second most important arthropod disease vectors with impacts in public health (Silva et al., 2006). Wild birds are frequently infested with ticks, and some bird species act as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. The latter include Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., the etiologic agent of Lyme borreliosis – the most frequent tick borne disease in moderate climates of the northern hemisphere (Lindgren and Jaenson, 2006). Since some bird species are migratory, they are also able to transport human disease vector ticks, and their associated pathogens, through long distances, to new disease foci (Reed et al., 2003). Therefore, it is important to understand the role of birds as hosts for ticks and reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens and, consequently, their impact in the emergence of zoonoses and on disease patterns, to eventually reduce disease risk and prevent outbreaks. Also, as bird ringers and researchers that capture and collect samples from birds may be exposed to the pathogens the birds might carry, and constitute a high risk group of exposure to ticks, it is important to raise their awareness about the disease risk (Abulreesh et al., 2007). Pathogens in ticks collected from birds have been screened only occasionally in Portugal (but see Santos-Silva et al., 2006; Lopes de Carvalho et al., 2012; Norte et al., 2013b). Thus, there is a need to increase surveillance on zoonotic pathogen prevalence associated with these hosts in order to manage these globally distributed potential threats. In this study, ticks were collected from resident and migratory birds captured at several ringing stations in mainland Portugal (hereafter Portugal), as a part of these stations’ avifauna monitoring programmes. Ticks were removed from birds, identified and tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. infection. This study contributed to assess patterns of bird infestation by ticks and prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in the avian host–tick system across a large geographical area in Portugal. Materials and methods Wild birds were captured using mist-nets at 19 counties in Portugal (Fig. 1 ) from January 2010 to August 2014, as part of established ringing station's capturing and monitoring programs at each site. Each bird was identified to species (Svensson, 1992; Mullarney et al., 1999), ringed for individual identification and inspected for attached ticks, with special attention to the areas of eyes, ears, beak, crown and neck. Ticks from each bird were removed with forceps and put separately in tubes with 70% ethanol. Ticks were separated by instar and sex, and identified at the stereomicroscope using conventional descriptive keys (Estrada-Peña et al., 2004; Pérez-Eid, 2007). Only Ixodes spp. were analyzed for B. burgdorferi s.l. infection because of established Borrelia vectorial capacity of several Ixodes spp. (Eisen and Lane, 2002). Of the Ixodes spp. ticks collected, 505 (67%) were randomly selected and screened for Borrelia infection, including 3 Ixodes acuminatus, 9 Ixodes arboricola, 416 Ixodes frontalis, 61 Ixodes ricinus, 2 Ixodes ventalloi and 14 Ixodidae ticks whose species were impossible to identify. Tick DNA was extracted by boiling in 25% ammonium hydroxide solution, as described previously by Schouls et al. (1999), except that of engorged females, which was extracted with DNeasy blood and tissue extraction kit (Qiagen). B. burgdorferi s.l. infection in ticks was assessed using a nested PCR targeting the 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (Rijpkema et al., 1995). A percentage of the positive samples (34%) were further tested in a nested PCR targeting the flaB gene (Johnson et al., 1992) for confirmation and in cases in which a good 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer sequence was not obtained and precluded genospecies identification in BLASTn (see below). Some larvae derived from the same bird were tested in pools (n =13 larvae, four pools), and for these we reported the minimum infected rate, i.e. if a pool was positive we assumed that at least one larvae in the pool was positive. Amplified products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Borrelia genospecies were identified by sequencing with the Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer, after purifying the amplified products of nested PCR using the JETquick system (Genomed, Inc.). Genospecies identification was based on the partial sequence of the 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (65%) and of the flaB gene (35%). Sequencing procedures were performed at the Unidade de Tecnologia e Inovação of National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge. Borrelia genospecies were identified by BLASTn analysis (NCBI). Mean tick infestation per infested bird was compared among bird species for which more than one individual was infested, after log transformation, using a Generalized Linear Model with a Poisson distribution in JMP6 (SAS Institute Inc.). Results Tick species collected from birds We captured 435 infested birds (including 13 recaptures), belonging to 38 species (Table 1 ), and 1349 ticks were collected from these birds (Table 1). Tick species collected included Haemaphysalis punctata, Hyalomma spp., I. acuminatus, I. arboricola, I. frontalis, I. ricinus and I. ventalloi. The most commonly tick species collected from birds was I. frontalis (n =640) followed by Hyalomma spp. (n =543). I. frontalis (collected in 14 counties) was the most widespread tick species, followed by Hyalomma spp. (nine counties). I. ricinus was also collected from nine counties but was found mostly in the center and north of Portugal (Fig. 1). I. frontalis ticks were collected mainly from October to March, except for larvae that showed a peak of collections in August (Fig. 2a). I. ricinus larvae were more abundant during summer, from June to September, whereas nymphs were collected mostly from November to June (Fig. 2b). Hyalomma spp. were mostly found during the summer months from August to September (Fig. 2c). The other tick species were collected in fewer numbers and their temporal distribution is more scattered: (a) I. ventalloi females were collected between March and June, and in November; (b) I. acuminatus larvae were collected in June and nymphs in June and December; (c) I. arboricola larvae were collected in March and December, nymphs in March and April, and adults in April (d) H. punctata larvae were collected in June and September and nymphs in July and August. Most ticks collected (38%) were found on Turdus merula, which along with Parus major, was the bird species parasitized with the highest diversity of tick species (n =5). I. frontalis and Hyalomma spp. were the most ubiquitous tick species collected from birds, i.e. from 22 species of birds (Table 1). I. acuminatus and I. ventalloi were collected respectively from two (Troglodytes troglodytes and Turdus iliacus) and one (T. merula) bird species only. I. arboricola were collected from four bird species: Aegithalus caudatus, P. major, Serinus serinus and Sitta europaea. T. merula was an important host for I. frontalis, I. ricinus, H. punctata and Hyalomma spp. ticks (Table 1; Fig. 3 ), because a large percentage of those tick species were collected from T. merula. Apart from T. merula, a large percentage of I. frontalis was collected from Erithacus rubecula and Turdus philomelos; I. ricinus was mostly collected from T. merula, Acrocephalus scirpaceus and T. troglodytes. Emberiza cirlus and Anthus trivialis were also important host for H. punctata, while most Hyalomma spp. ticks, apart from T. merula, were collected from a large variety of bird species (Fig. 3). Mean tick infestation intensity was significantly different among infested birds ( χ 1,25 2 = 57.34 , P <0.0002; Fig. 4 ) with E. cirlus, Hirundo rustica, Luscinia megarrhynchus, Lullula arborea and Saxicola rubicola being the bird species that presented higher tick infestation intensities (Table 1; Fig. 4). B. burgdorferi s.l. infection in ticks collected from birds We detected 9.3% (47/505) of ticks (40 I. frontalis, 4 I. ricinus and 3 Ixodidae) infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. from 33 (13.2%; 33/250) birds (Table 2 ). Bird species carrying infected ticks included P. major, Sylvia melanocephala, T. merula and T. philomelos. Thirty five ticks (6.9%) were infected with Borrelia turdi, one (0.2%) with Borrelia valaisiana and one (0.2%; T794A) with a Borrelia sp. similar to B. bissettii (B. bissettii-like). The flaB sequence of this strain was 96% identical to B. bissettii isolate 3N2L-IC (Genbank accession number: KF918618), and its 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region sequence presented 87% of similarity to B. bissettii isolate p11a8 (Genbank accession nr: FJ431140) in Blastn. The 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region sequences of the B. turdi positives obtained in our study had the highest similarity (92–98%) with Ya501 reference strain (accession nr: D84407) in Blastn. The highest similarities for the B. turdi flaB sequences were B. turdi strain Yh501 (accession nr: D85071; 92–99% of similarity) and strain PoAnB9 (accession nr: JQ765378; 95–97% of similarity). B. valaisiana sequence detected was 95% similar to the strain Tom4006 (accession nr: CP009117). The remainder 10 positive ticks were not sequenced but were collected from birds carrying B. turdi infected ticks. B. turdi was detected in I. frontalis larvae and nymphs and in I. ricinus nymphs showing a higher prevalence in ticks derived from Turdus sp. B. valaisiana was detected in one Ixodes sp. larvae feeding on T. merula. B. bissettii-like was detected in one I. ricinus feeding on a S. melanocephala. Discussion The tick species collected from birds, mostly passerines, throughout Portugal have been reported parasitizing avian hosts before (Santos-Silva et al., 2006, 2011; Norte et al., 2012). However, this is the first study in which I. ventalloi ticks (adult females) have been found in passerine birds in Portugal. Adult and sub-adult stages have been previously collected in Portugal from Asio flameus and Tyto alba (Santos-Silva et al., 2011), and the association of this tick species with birds has been reported before (Gilot and Perez, 1977; Kolonin, 2009), but this species is considered to be endophilic and monotropic, and has mammals (Kolonin, 2009), especially the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus (Pérez-Eid, 2007), as preferential hosts. I. frontalis was an ubiquitous species found in birds, in support of its ornithophilic habits (Pérez-Eid, 2007), being the most commonly collected tick in terms of abundance, geographical distribution and diversity of birds species used as hosts, followed by Hyalomma spp. The morphological distinction of Hyalomma species is difficult with conventional keys, especially for immature stages, which were the ones we found in birds. Both Hyalomma lusitanicum and Hyalomma marginatum occur in Portugal but their relative abundance differs depending on the geographical area (Santos-Silva et al., 2011). H. marginatum was reported to be relatively common in birds of several species in Portugal (Santos-Silva et al., 2011). Our collections of I. ricinus, derived only from the center and north of Portugal, contrasts with previous studies, up to 2009, in which this species was reported to be present in all areas of Portuguese mainland, although with a patchy distribution (Baptista, 2006; Santos-Silva et al., 2011). The annual variation of collection of I. frontalis, mostly restricted to autumn and winter months, is in accordance with previous focal studies in central Portugal (Norte et al., 2012), except for the peak of larvae in August found in this study. The seasonal pattern of I. ricinus collected from birds was also expected, although the period of nymph collection was broader in the present study – from autumn to late spring. The collection of Hyalomma spp. ticks, which is a species commonly found in the Mediterranean area from late spring to late summer (Estrada-Peña et al., 2011), was restricted to summer months. The fact that most ticks (in number and diversity) were collected from T. merula, is in accordance with T. merula generally high prevalence and intensity of tick infestation. This is probably related with the foraging habits of this bird species (Norte et al., 2012). The bird species with higher mean tick infestation intensity, apart from T. merula, included others that also forage or breed in low levels of vegetation or shrubs, such as E. cirlus, S. rubicola, and L. megarrhynchus, but this is not the case for H. rustica. However, it should be noted that only a few infested individuals were captured from these bird species and we do not know if this pattern can be generalized. Whereas I. frontalis and Hyalomma spp. were collected from several bird species (n =22), I. acuminatus, I. ventalloi and I. arboricola were found on only a few bird species. This is related with these ticks host preferences, namely small mammals (I. acuminatus), rabbits (I. ventalloi) and birds that used tree-holes as roosts or nests (I. arboricola). B. burgdorferi s.l. infection was detected for the first time in ticks collected from S. melanocephala. A large number of S. melanocephala ticks have been collected previously in a B. burgdorferi s.l. enzootic focus (Tapada de Mafra, Portugal) and no positives have been detected (Norte et al., 2013b). We did not detect any positive ticks collected from E. rubecula in accordance with the large number of negative ticks collected from this bird species previously in Portugal (Norte et al., 2013b). However, B. burgdorferi s.l. DNA has been reported in ticks from E. rubecula migrating through Scandinavia (Olsen et al., 1995; Comstedt et al., 2006; Hasle, 2010; Kjelland et al., 2010) and central Europe (Poupon et al., 2006; Dubska et al., 2009), and from individuals captured in Germany (Kaiser et al., 2002) and in Spain (Palomar et al., 2012). E. rubecula has been considered reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.l. because infected larvae (Olsen et al., 1995) have been collected from it and spirochaetes have been detected in its tissues (Humair et al., 1993; Gryczynska et al., 2004). This apparent difference in the capacity of E. rubecula as reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.l. may be partially due to the effects of migration on B. burgdorferi s.l. infection relapses (Gylfe et al., 2000), because, according to our ringing data and captures’ time frame, the birds in our study were either resident or starting the spring northward migration, and the effect of migration on Borrelia infection relapse may not yet be apparent. Also, B. burgdorferi s.l. reports from E. rubecula have originated mainly from I. ricinus ticks (but see Humair et al. (1993) and Gryczynska et al. (2004)) and the majority of ticks screened in this study were I. frontalis – an interaction between host and tick species may help to explain the discrepancy in results among studies. However, more studies specifically designed to assess the potential of E. rubecula, a common passerine bird often infested by ticks, as B. burgdorferi s.l. reservoir, are needed. B. turdi was a common genospecies in I. frontalis, especially those feeding on Turdus spp. (T. merula and T. philomelos), but also on P. major. Relatively high prevalence of B. turdi in I. frontalis, including larvae, feeding on these bird species have been reported in the area of Coimbra, Portugal (17–33%, Norte et al., 2013b). Because we do not know if transovarial transmission of B. turdi occurs in I. frontalis, it is difficult to draw conclusions on reservoir competence of T. philomelos and P. major considering larval infection rates (but see Norte et al., 2013a) where T. merula was confirmed reservoir for B. turdi by xenodiagnosis). Noneless, it is evident that this genospecies is strongly associated with birds and their ornithophilic ticks. B. turdi was firstly described from Japan also in an ornithophilic tick feeding on a passerine bird (Fukunaga et al., 1996). The three detections of B. turdi in I. ricinus nymphs in this study support the hypothesis that this genospecies is not easily transmitted to I. ricinus (Norte et al., 2013a), limiting the probability of spreading to other hosts rather than birds. One Borrelia sp., with the highest similarity with B. bissettii in BLASTn for both the 5S-23S rDNA and flaB gene – B. bissettii – like, was detected in one I. ricinus nymph feeding on a S. melanocephala. B. bissettii, first described from the United States (Postic et al., 1998) has also been detected in Europe, although, so far, data from central Europe suggests its prevalence to be low (Hanincova et al., 2003; Hulinska et al., 2007). The main reservoirs for B. bissettii are considered to be rodents (Piesman and Gern, 2004) but it has also been detected in the blood of lizards (Clark et al., 2005) and, recently, in the blood and Ixodes pacificus ticks from birds in Northwestern California, U.S.A. (Newman et al., 2015). The possibility of the strain detected in this study to be a novel genospecies associated with birds in Europe can not be excluded. However, this could only be confirmed by a more detailed genetical characterization through e.g. multilocus sequence typing. Because this technique needs a relatively large amount of DNA, which was not available from this specimen, we could not confirm this hypothesis. Avian-associated Borrelia genospecies such as B. valaisiana and B. garinii were detected with a low prevalence (B. valaisiana) or not detected at all (B. garinii) in ticks derived from birds in this study. This may be due to the relatively small number of I. ricinus collected in our study (compared with other tick species). Additionally, if these genospecies have an uneven distribution across geographical areas, due to different biocenoses, or their prevalence varies through time in relation to their hosts’ life cycle, this could explain our results. This study contributed to a better knowledge of the Ixodidae tick fauna parasitizing birds in Western Europe and to the assessment of the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. associated with birds and their ticks. The risk of this pathogen dissemination by the bird species studied appears to be low but is not inexistent because two potentially pathogenic B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies, namely one closely related to B. bissettii and B. valaisiana, have been detected in ticks collected from birds, although in low prevalence. The high prevalence of B. turdi calls for transmission and pathogenicity studies, since little is known about these subjects for this genospecies. Accession numbers B. bissettii- like (Borreliasp. T794A) 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer and flaB sequences detected in this study have been deposited in Genbank with the accession numbers KP125321 and KT207789, respectively. B. turdi 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer sequences (KT207783, KT207784, KT207785, KT207786) and flaB sequences (KT207787, KT207788) detected in this study are also accessible in Genbank.

Only experimental therapies are available, thus, novel diagnosis tools and druggable targets are needed. Results: Analysis of Ebola virus genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short DNA sequences that appear nowhere in the human genome. We identify the shortest such sequences with lengths between 12 and 14. Only three absent sequences of length 12 exist and they consistently appear at the same location on two of the Ebola virus proteins, in all Ebola virus genomes, but nowhere in the human genome. The alignment-free method used is able to identify pathogen-specific signatures for quick and precise action against infectious agents, of which the current Ebola virus outbreak provides a compelling example.",

These error control techniques in the real or complex fields are not subject to stringent restrictions on block length, as it is the case in Galois fields, and can be readily performed in DSPs. Furthermore, they are capable of exploring the redundancy that naturally exists in oversampled signals, rather than introducing redundant data in a different domain and in a separate channel-coding step (the finite field approach). However, the use of finite-precision real arithmetic raises the question of numerical stability. We study the conditioning of an error correction algorithm in the complex field, in an attempt to understand the effect of the location of the errors and the effect of the error amplitudes. We then consider the parallel concatenation of these codes, which seems to lead to surprisingly stable codes, and formulate a number of open problems concerning them.",

All rights reserved.The classical WKS sampling theorem is a central result in signal processing, but it applies to band-limited signals only. For many purposes, this class of signals is too narrow. For example, the signals that occur in practice are invariably of finite duration, or time-limited, and often have discontinuities. Clearly, such signals cannot be band-limited. We consider the problem of approximating such signals, or other signals not necessarily band-limited, using sampling series. We do not assume that the sampling instants are regularly distributed, in order to account for errors due to jitter. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of obtaining nonuniform sampling approximations for signals not necessarily band-limited, despite its practical interest, has not been addressed in the literature. In this work we introduce a method that leads to sampling approximations with the required properties. It is shown that the sampling sums considered are capable of approximating a wide class of signals, with arbitrarily small L2and L∞errors.",

The threshold for a 'reduced' BRS was established by the ATRAMI study at BRS < 3 ms/mmHg in patients with a previous myocardial infarction, and has been shown to improve risk assessment in many other cardiac dysfunctions. The successful application of this cut-offto other populations suggests that it may reflect an inherent property of baroreflex functioning, so our goal is to investigate whether it represents a 'natural' partition of BRS values. As reduced baroreflex responsiveness is also associated with ageing, we investigated whether a BRS estimate < 3 ms/mmHg could be the result of a process of physiological senescence as well as a sign of BRS dysfunction. This study involved 228 chronic heart failure patients and 60 age-matched controls. Our novel method combined transfer function BRS estimation and automatic clustering of BRS probability distributions, to define indicative levels of different BRS activities. The analysis produced a fit clustering (cophenetic correlation coefficient 0.9 out of 1) and identified one group of homogeneous patients (well separated from the others by 3 ms/mmHg) with an increased BRS-based mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR): 3.19 (1.73, 5.89), P < 0.001]. The age-dependent BRS cut-off, estimated by 5% quantile regression of log (BRS) with age (considering the age-matched controls), provides a similar mortality value [HR: 2.44 (1.37, 4.43), P = 0.003]. In conclusion, the 3 ms/mmHg cut-offidentifies two large clusters of homogeneous heart failure (HF) patients, thus supporting the hypothesis of a natural cut-offin the HF population. Furthermore, age was found to have no statistical impact on risk assessment, suggesting that there is no need to establish age-based cut-offs because 3 ms/mmHg optimally identifies patients at high mortality risk.",

        "doc_abstract": "An autonomous DGPS navigation system must use an accurate threedimensional (3D) digital map. However, it is crucial to validate it using data collected in the field. One possible way to validate the map is to employ a vehicle driven by an expert to ensure that the trajectory is plotted within the boundaries of navigation paths. It is essential to take this care, especially when the terrain is very highly uneven and small differences in position may correspond to large vertical deviations. A small navigation error can result in a serious fall, which may damage or even destroy the vehicle. In the Douro Demarcated Region, in northern Portugal, the vineyard is planted on narrow terraces built on steep hills along the winding Douro River. This paper presents the results of a dynamic trajectory survey obtained from a real navigation procedure, carried out by an expert driving an instrumented tractor during the spraying of the vineyard. The results were obtained using a DGPS (accuracy = 2 cm) and compared to an existing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the vineyard already created by the authors' work group, with an average accuracy of 10 cm. The results are shown in a C# developed interface with OpenGL facilities, which enable the viewing of the 3D vineyard details. The results confirm the validation of the methodology previously adopted for map extraction and respective equipment selection. The trajectory of the tractor, including some maneuvers, is drawn within the inner and outer edges of each terrace or path that exists in the vineyard. The interface can also be used as an important tool in path planning to automatically extract the topology of the vineyard and to select the best path to carry out some vineyard tasks. © 2015 Springer International Publishing.",

The synthesis of superoscillating signals is a numerically difficult problem. Minimum energy superoscillatory signals seem attractive for applications because (i) the minimum-energy solution is unique (ii) it has the smallest energy cost (iii) it may yield a signal of the smallest possible amplitude. On the negative side, superoscillating functions of minimum-energy depend heavily on cancellation and give rise to expressions that have very large coefficients. Furthermore, these coefficients have to be found by solving equations that are very ill-conditioned. Surprisingly, we show that by dropping the minimum energy requirement practicality can be gained rather than lost. We give a method of constructing superoscillating signals that leads to coefficients and condition numbers that are smaller by several orders of magnitude than the minimum-energy solution, yet yields energies close to the minimum. In contrast with the minimum-energy method, which builds superoscillations by linearly combining functions with an ill-conditioned Gram matrix, our method combines orthonormal functions, the Gram matrix of which is obviously the identity. Another feature of the method is that it yields the superoscillatory signal that maximises the energy concentration in a given set, which may or may not include the superoscillatory segment. © 2014 IEEE.",

We show that it is possible to construct superoscillations by constraining not only the value of the signal but also that of its derivative. This allows a better control of the shape of the superoscillations. We find that for any given bandwidth, no matter how small, there exists a unique signal of minimum energy that satisfies any combination of amplitude and derivative constraints, on a sampling grid as fine as desired. We determine the energy of the signal, for any grid, regular or irregular. When the set of derivative constraints is empty the results reduce to minimum energy interpolation. In the absence of amplitude constraints, we obtain pure derivative-constrained extremals. The flexibility gained by having two different types of constraints makes it possible to design superoscillations based only on amplitudes, based only on derivatives, or based on both. In the last case, the amplitude and derivative sampling grids can be interleaved or aligned. We explore this flexibility to build superoscillations that cost less energy.

We show that this class of signals can be made to superoscillate by prescribing its values on an arbitrarily fine and possibly nonuniform grid. The superoscillations can be made to occur at a large distance from the nonzero samples of the signal. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem to have a solution, in terms of the nature of the two sets involved in the problem.

Due to the leakage effect in the case where the frequency is not a multiple of the fundamental frequency of the DFT, the success of the traditional CS algorithms is limited. To overcome this problem our algorithm transform the DFT basis into a frame with a larger number of vectors, by inserting a small number of columns between some of the initial ones. The algorithm takes advantage of the compactness of the interpolation function that results from the ℓ1 norm minimization of the Basis Pursuit (BP) and is based on the compressive sensing theory that allows us to acquire and represent sparse and compressible signals, using a much lower sampling rate than the Nyquist rate.

It will in fact be shown that these seven theorems are all equivalent to one another, in the sense that each is a corollary of the others. Since these theorems can all be deduced from each other, one of them has to be proven independently in order to verify all. It is convenient to choose the ASF, introduced in 1963. The epilogue treats possible extensions to the more general contexts of reproducing kernel theory and of abstract harmonic analysis, using locally compact abelian groups. This paper is expository in the sense that it treats a number of mathematical theorems, their interconnections, their equivalence to one another.

Theoretically, compression-based similarity depends on the concept of Kol-mogorov complexity, which is non-computable. The implementations require compression algorithms that are approximately normal. The approach has important advantages (no signal features to identify and extract, for example) but the compression method must be normal. This paper proposes normal algorithms based on mixtures of finite context models. Normality is attained by combining two new ideas: the use of least-recently-used caching in the context models, to allow deeper contexts, and data interleaving, to better explore that cache. Examples for DNA sequences are given (at the human genome scale). © 2014 IEEE.",

Maximal exact matches are perfect repeats, without gaps or misspellings, which cannot be further extended to either their left- or right-end side without loss of similarity. The genomic distance here proposed is based on the normalized compression distance, an information-theoretic measure of the relative compressibility of two sequences estimated using multiple finite-context models. This measure exposes similarities between the sequences, as well as, the nesting structure underlying the assembly of larger maximal exact matches from smaller ones. We use four human genome assemblies for illustration and discuss the impact of genome sequencing and assembly in the final content of maximal exact matches and the genomic distance here proposed. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",

        "doc_abstract": "Data summarization and triage is one of the current top challenges in visual analytics. The goal is to let users visually inspect large data sets and examine or request data with particular characteristics. The need for summarization and visual analytics is also felt when dealing with digital representations of DNA sequences. Genomic data sets are growing rapidly, making their analysis increasingly more difficult, and raising the need for new, scalable tools. For example, being able to look at very large DNA sequences while immediately identifying potentially interesting regions would provide the biologist with a flexible exploratory and analytical tool. In this paper we present a new concept, the \"information profile\", which provides a quantitative measure of the local complexity of a DNA sequence, independently of the direction of processing. The computation of the information profiles is computationally tractable: we show that it can be done in time proportional to the length of the sequence. We also describe a tool to compute the information profiles of a given DNA sequence, and use the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 972 h- and five human chromosomes 22 for illustration. We show that information profiles are useful for detecting large-scale genomic regularities by visual inspection. Several discovery strategies are possible, including the standalone analysis of single sequences, the comparative analysis of sequences from individuals from the same species, and the comparative analysis of sequences from different organisms. The comparison scale can be varied, allowing the users to zoom-in on specific details, or obtain a broad overview of a long segment.

As expected, the application has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be viewed as a tool to help undergraduate students test and assess the Fourier series expansions on a typical set of signals, whose analytical Fourier series coefficients were found during the theoretical lectures. Additionally, some of its main characteristics include the ability for the students to control the total approximation error and the number of terms/harmonics used in the expansion.",

In particular, the following questions remain open: Is the phenomenon of symmetry statistically significant? If so, what is the word length above which significance is lost? Can deviations in symmetry due to the finite size of the data be identified? This work addresses these questions by studying word symmetries in the human genome, chromosomes and transcriptome. To rule out finite-length effects, the results are compared with those obtained from random control sequences built to satisfy Chargaff's second parity rule. We use several techniques to evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, a novel word symmetry distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. We conclude that word symmetries are statistical significant in the human genome for word lengths up to 6. nucleotides. For longer words, we present evidence that the phenomenon may not be as prevalent as previously thought. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Tel.: +351 234370650. Previous studies have suggested that Chargaff's second rule may hold for relatively long words (above 10nucleotides), but this has not been conclusively shown. In particular, the following questions remain open: Is the phenomenon of symmetry statistically significant? If so, what is the word length above which significance is lost? Can deviations in symmetry due to the finite size of the data be identified? This work addresses these questions by studying word symmetries in the human genome, chromosomes and transcriptome. To rule out finite-length effects, the results are compared with those obtained from random control sequences built to satisfy Chargaff's second parity rule. We use several techniques to evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, a novel word symmetry distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. We conclude that word symmetries are statistical significant in the human genome for word lengths up to 6nucleotides. For longer words, we present evidence that the phenomenon may not be as prevalent as previously thought. Keywords Single strand symmetry Oligonucleotide composition Word symmetry distance Equivalence testing 1 Introduction The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA (Watson and Crick, 1953) made evident that the total percentage of complementary nucleotides (A–T and C–G) in a double-stranded molecule should be equal. This property had been previously reported by Chargaff and it is accordingly known as Chargaff's (1950) first parity rule. The detailed analysis of some bacterial genomes led to the formulation of Chargaff's second parity rule, which asserts that the percentage of complementary nucleotides should also be equal in each of the two strands (Rudner et al., 1968a, 1968b; Karkas et al., 1968). This rule has been extensively confirmed in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, including more recent results (e.g. Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Baisnée et al., 2002; Albrecht-Buehler, 2007; Kong et al., 2009; Zhang and Huang, 2010), that use global association measures and suggest that the symmetry holds for words with up to 10nucleotides (nt). However, the universality of Chargaff's second parity rule has been questioned for organellar DNA and some viral genomes (Mitchell and Bridge, 2006). A natural extension of Chargaff's second parity rule is that, in each DNA strand, the number of occurrences of a given word should match that of its reversed complement. A genomic word, or oligonucleotide, of length k is here interchangeably denoted as a k-mer. Moreover, we refer to the reversed complement as the symmetric word and the pair constituted by both words as a symmetric pair. The symmetry phenomenon that we aim to investigate pertains to the distributions of symmetric pairs, i.e. the distribution of all words and the distribution of the corresponding reversed complements. We focus our study on the complete human genome, on each chromosome and on the transcriptome. As far as we know, previous works do not answer the following question: Are the observed discrepancies between the empirical distributions of the k-mers and their reversed complements, for each k, sufficiently small to infer that they are modeled by the same probability law, and is the phenomenon of the symmetry of DNA sequences statistically significant? Caution is required regarding the application of some traditional statistical tests, which can yield irrelevant or even misleading results, as reported in Baisnée et al. (2002). We adopt a number of independent approaches to detect the word length k above which the single strand symmetry ceases, or partially ceases, to exist. We use a number of standard statistical tools and introduce an adapted version of a multiple equivalence test. We also introduce a word symmetry distance based on Ulam's metric. The contributions in this work lead to the identification in the human genome of the range of word lengths for which symmetry is statistically significant, as well as the threshold beyond which it seems to break. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials We analyze the human genome and use the reference assembly build 37.3 available from the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information discarding all non-sequenced nucleotides (N) from the analysis. All chromosomes and the transcriptome of the human genome were processed as separate sequences. The words were counted with overlapping. We generated 24 random control sequences of the same size as the sequences of corresponding human chromosomes. The model used to generate the random sequences assumes Chargaff's second parity rule: the probability of occurrence of complement nucleotides is equal ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) and the probability of occurrence of each pair of complement nucleotides is estimated as the average of the nucleotides frequency of occurrence in the corresponding human chromosome. The sequences used in this work are denoted as follows: • human chromosomes: H c ; • random control chromosomes: RC c ; • whole assembled human genome: H a ; • whole assembled random control sequences: RC a ; • transcriptome of human genome: RNA. 2.2 Methods For a given word length k, we compare the frequency distribution of all words and the frequency distribution of their reversed complements, in order to evaluate the symmetry phenomenon. We use several methods, including some well-known measures 1. Pearson's correlation coefficient (C), 2. Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL), 3. total variational distance (S 1), which is a normalized L 1 distance (L 1 distance divided by 2) (Dembo and Karlin, 1992). We also use the well-known chi-square test to assess the statistically significance of the exact symmetry (that is, to check whether the probabilities of words and the corresponding reversed complements are equal). Furthermore, we propose two novel methods based on equivalence tests and Ulam's metric, described below. 2.2.1 Equivalence tests Let π 1 , π 2 denote the (population) proportions of one word and its corresponding reversed complement (a symmetric pair). Let p 1, p 2 denote the corresponding sample proportions. Traditional statistical hypothesis testing may be used to assess the differences between two proportions. However, it is well known that when traditional hypothesis tests are applied to large data sets, any small effect is always deemed significant (Moore, 1997; Kline, 2004; Migliorati and Ongaro, 2010). To overcome this drawback, we use equivalence tests for accepting/rejecting the equivalence hypotheses between the proportions of symmetric words. Because the word proportions may have low (or very low) values, particularly for large k, the differences between them may not be a good measure for evaluating discrepancies. Hence, we study the proportion ratio π 1 / π 2 . The statistical hypotheses for the equivalence test are H 0 : π 1 / π 2 ≥ δ or π 1 / π 2 ≤ 1 / δ vs H 1 : 1 / δ < π 1 / π 2 < δ . here δ ( > 1 ) represents a small tolerance used to conclude a practical equivalence between the proportions of symmetric words. For convenience, the hypotheses above are formulated only for one pair of symmetric words, but they represent all pairs of symmetric words. The ratio between two proportions, r = p 1 / p 2 , is an effect size measure. As in many studies, e.g. Thanassoulis and Vasan (2010), we consider the effect to be weak when it assumes values between 1.1 and 1.3 and we explore these lower effect size values as a tolerance to conclude about practical equivalence. The confidence interval for the unknown true value of π 1 / π 2 , considering the ln-method of Katz et al. (1978), for a given α , is ( p 1 p 2 e − z 1 − α / 2 1 / n 1 − 1 / N + 1 / n 2 − 1 / N ; p 1 p 2 e z 1 − α / 2 1 / n 1 − 1 / N + 1 / n 2 − 1 / N ) where n 1 and n 2 are the number of occurrences of the corresponding words and N is the total number of word occurrences. The equivalence tests procedure consists of obtaining the confidence interval for the proportion ratios and checking if it is contained within the interval ( 1 / δ , δ ) . If so, H 0 is rejected and the equivalence can be assumed. For each word length k, we performed 4 k equivalence tests. When all of the 4 k null hypotheses are rejected, we consider that the distributions of symmetric pairs (i.e. the distribution of occurrence of all words and the distribution of occurrence of their corresponding reversed complements) are equivalent. 2.2.2 Word symmetry distance For a given word length k, the distribution of original words is sorted by frequency values and the final arrangement is denoted as A 1 ( k ) . A second arrangement, A 2 ( k ) , is obtained by sorting symmetric pairs according to the largest frequency value of each pair. In this way, symmetric words are kept adjacent and elements of the pair are sorted according to their frequencies. For illustration, consider an arrangement of the dinucleotides A 1 ( 2 ) [ AA AT TT AG CT AC GT CA CG TG GA GC TC CC GG TA ] and the corresponding arrangement A 2 ( 2 ) [ AA TT AT AG CT AC GT CA TG CG GA TC GC CC GG TA ] . Under the assumption of the symmetry phenomenon, A 1 ( k ) should be equal to A 2 ( k ) . Deviations from this ideal symmetry are quantified using Ulam's metric, which is the minimum number of moves required to go from arrangement A 1 to arrangement A 2. This metric, denoted as U ( A 1 ; A 2 ) , is related with the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence (Aldous and Diaconis, 1999). For the example above U ( A 1 ( 2 ) ; A 2 ( 2 ) ) = 3 . As a consequence of the definition of A 2 and for a fixed word length k, the maximum Ulam distance is max { U ( A 1 ( k ) ; A 2 ( k ) ) } = 4 k / 2 . Therefore, we introduce a word symmetry distance given by Ws ( k ) = 2 4 k U ( A 1 ( k ) ; A 2 ( k ) ) , where Ws ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , with values close to zero indicating that the distributions of symmetric pairs are nearly identical, and values close to one reflecting the opposite. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Symmetry hypothesis testing To evaluate the exact symmetry hypothesis for different word lengths (that is, whether the probability of a word equals the probability of its reversed complement) we use the χ 2 goodness of fit test. For random data generated according to the hypothesis, the test should of course reveal non-significant differences. Table 1 presents the p-values of the goodness of fit test of the studied sequences. As expected, the null hypothesis is confirmed for the random sequences, but it is rejected for the human genomic sequences. For the random control sequences (RC c , RC a ), generated with equal A/T and C/G compositions, the exact symmetry phenomenon prevails for the studied word lengths. This is not observed in the human sequences (H c , H a , RNA). Since the random and human sequences have the same length, this cannot be due to the sample size. It is known that for sample sizes like those we use and for a reasonable number of categories, the differences between proportions have a large chance of being detected. The irrelevance of the traditional statistical tests when used to evaluate the symmetry phenomenon was also pointed out in Baisnée et al. (2002). Therefore, we applied statistical tests of equivalence to the data, and tested if the proportion ratios are close to one. Table 2 presents the results of equivalence tests for the proportions ratio for the studied sequences. Tolerances close to δ are often used. We present the percentage of equivalent symmetric pairs for two tolerances: δ = 1.3 and the more strict δ = 1.1 . To interpret the equivalence test results one should take into consideration the value of the tolerance and the size of the studied sequences. In order to check for the presence or importance of a possible finite-size effect, we use the random sequences as control sequences. Obviously, in an infinite random sequence generated as described before, we would expect to observe the symmetry phenomenon (similar frequencies for all symmetric pairs), regardless of the word lengths. If this is not observed in a finite sample, there is reason to suspect sample-size effects. Table 2 shows the results obtained. Consider first δ = 1.3 . The percentage of equivalent word pairs for the human sequence H a is below 100% for word lengths above 8, and below 85% for word length 10. This stands in contrast to what is observed in the random sequence RC a , which, despite having the same length as H a , shows 100% equivalent pairs for all word lengths up to 10. Thus, the decrease observed in H a cannot be due to the sample size. In the case of the shorter random sequences RC c , the table shows a decrease in the percentage of equivalent pairs, starting with length 8. However, the decrease in the case of the human sequences H c is stronger and starts for length 6. Thus, although the effect of the finite sample size cannot be entirely ruled out, the difference between the two cases remains nevertheless clear. The case δ = 1.1 confirms this. Under this tighter tolerance, deviations from 100% equivalent pairs can be noted both in the random data and in the human data. However, the differences between the human and the random cases remain considerable and cannot be entirely explained by the limited sample size. The RNA sequence shows symmetry deviations already for very small word lengths ( k > 3 when δ = 1.1 , and k > 1 when δ = 1.3 ). We observe a much higher percentage of non-equivalent pairs in comparison with the random sequences RC c , which is of a comparable size (RNA has about 134 megabases and the average size of the chromosomes is about 129 megabases). Table 3 presents a summary of the occurrence ratios for symmetric pairs. The table shows the maximum ratio ( max r ), 95th percentile ratio (P 95r ) and 75th percentile ratio (P 75r ) between the proportions of the words in each symmetric pair. For words of length 10nt, a maximum value of 17 was observed. This means that at least one word occurred 17 times more than the corresponding symmetric word. However, in all k-mers the majority of ratios assume low values: the 95th percentile ratio is lower than 1.2 and the 75th percentile ratio is lower than 1.1. In general, for the complete human genome (H a ), and for the corresponding random sequence (RC a ), symmetric pairs have ratio values close to 1. However, for k > 7 , we observe some pairs with high (or very high) ratio values which is in accordance with the equivalence test results. When k > 7 , not all word symmetric pairs can be considered equivalent. We carried out an exploratory analysis of the content of these word pairs. For each pair we searched for the presence of oligonucleotides (with 1–5 symbols). Table 4 shows the four most frequent oligonucleotides (nucleotide to tetranucleotide) present in non-equivalent pairs. For 8-mers, 9-mers and 10-mers we observe that all words in the non-equivalent pairs have a rich C/G content, i.e. all words contain C, G and CG. Moreover, a high percentage of nonequivalent pairs contains CGCG. This evidence is in accordance with the observation first made several decades ago (Josse et al., 1961) of the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) in the human genome, hypothesized to be a consequence of the hypermutability of CpGs due to the increased mutation rate of 5-methylcytosine followed by the inaccurate mismatch repair of deaminated 5-methylcytosine (i.e. uracil) that introduces a thymine upon replication (Bird, 1980). Finally, we note that our listing of non-equivalent pairs may represent words involved in evolutionary processes that may be distinct for different word lengths (Nikolaou and Almirantis, 2005; Bush and Lahn, 2006). 3.2 Pearson's correlation coefficient, Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) and total variational distance Table 5 presents the results of several techniques to evaluate the word symmetry phenomenon. We present Pearson's correlation coefficient values, which suggest a strong word symmetry phenomenon, in line with the previous work in this area (Albrecht-Buehler, 2006; Prabhu, 1993). However, it is well known that this coefficient is not robust to outliers, such as poly-A and poly-T words. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence and total variational distance (S 1) results are in agreement with Pearson's correlation coefficient (C): words and symmetric words distributions are close, at least for words of length up to 10nt. C and 1 − S 1 assume values between zero and one, and values higher than 0.9 correspond to a strong association. Kullback–Leibler divergence assumes values in (0, ∞ ), with greater values corresponding to larger distances. These measures, C, S 1 and KL, may be overstating the symmetry phenomenon, because they only evaluate the global agreement between all corresponding values in both distributions (words vs corresponding symmetric words) and not if this agreement is the strongest among all possible pairs. 3.3 Word symmetry distance In order to measure the strength of the symmetry phenomenon, we introduced a new word symmetry distance, Ws. In the complete human genome (H a ) we observe (see Table 5) that for smaller k-mers ( k < 4 ), the symmetric words permutation is the closest to the original distribution. For larger k-mers ( k ≥ 4 ), there are other nearest permutations. However, for k=4 and k=5, we obtain a small distance, which leads us to conclude that the phenomenon of symmetry is still reasonably strong. For k ≥ 6 the symmetric words permutation is increasingly more distant from the original distribution. To better characterize the fading of the symmetry phenomenon, we estimate the percentage of symmetric word pairs that are spaced at most d words in A 1 (the arrangement of words is sorted by their frequencies). Fig. 1 presents these percentages for d < 50 . Naturally, we observe that the distances between symmetric words increase with the word length. For the random complete genome (RC a ) we observe that word symmetry distances reach higher values than for the human genome, indicating a lower symmetry in random sequences when compared with the corresponding human genome. In Table 5, for 1 < k < 7 and for the complete human genome we obtain a word symmetry distance lower than in the random sequences. For k > 6 the random and human complete genomes present similar word symmetry distances. This result seems to contradict previous ones obtained by the equivalence and the traditional hypothesis test. However, from all these results, we observe that the differences between frequencies of symmetric words in the random sequences are lower than in the human sequences. In the sorted frequency vector the distances between symmetric words in the random sequences are higher than in the human sequences. The random control sequences were generated to model Chargaff's second parity rule ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) thus it is expected that the frequency of occurrence of any word is similar to that of its reversed complement. This similarity is expected for any word length. Since, for word lengths greater than 1 ( k > 1 ) there are groups of words whose expected frequencies are similar (e.g. AAA, AAT, ATA, ATT, TAA, TAT, TTA, TTT), we do not expect null distances between the frequencies of the symmetric word pairs in the vector sorted by the frequency of occurrence. Thus, the results obtained for the word symmetry distance of the random sequences are in agreement with the expected values. In addition, to better characterize the symmetry phenomenon, for each k-mer, we find the maximum distance between two symmetric words ( max d ) in A 1. Note that the maximum distance between two words in a general arrangement is 4 k − 1 . Because of this, we propose a normalized maximum distance max ′ d = max d / ( 4 k − 1 ) . In Table 5 we observe that in the complete human genome (H a ) the normalized maximum distance is small ( < 0.1 ) for k-mers of length 1–9nt, but larger for 10-mers. If we consider a threshold of 0.05, the symmetry phenomenon is relevant for words of length up to 8nt. In the random complete sequence (RC a ) using the normalized maximum distance with 0.05 threshold, the symmetry phenomenon is relevant only for k=1 and takes values similar to the complete human genome only for k=1 or k=10. In order to compare the symmetry results for the random control sequences with the corresponding human chromosomes and RNA sequences, we present some plots in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 we observe that the word symmetry distances in RNA and the random control sequences are very similar. In the human chromosome sequences the average values of the word symmetry for 1 < k < 8 suggest higher symmetry than in random or RNA sequences. Fig. 3 shows two scatter plots to study the size effect in word symmetry distance, for k=7 and k=10. For random sequences, the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient between chromosome size and word symmetry distance is lower than 0.5 for k ≤ 8 and for k > 8 the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient is higher than 0.80. This difference might arise from the finite sample size. These results emphasize the hypothesis that for k > 8 the effect of the sample size begins to be noticeable, as already suggested in the context of equivalence testing. 4 Conclusion We used several criteria to compare distributions of words and their reversed complements, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, a novel word symmetry distance, the normalized maximum distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. Our results for relatively short words agree with and reinforce previous evidence in the literature (Albrecht-Buehler, 2006; Baisnée et al., 2002; Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Prabhu, 1993). The several measures used complement each other, providing a broader description of the symmetry phenomenon. In terms of frequency similarity, the symmetry was assessed with the total variational distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, traditional and equivalence hypothesis tests. In terms of correlation the symmetry was described by Pearson's coefficient. In terms of the distance between symmetric words in sorted frequency vector the symmetry was discussed by the word symmetry distance and the normalized maximum distance. We compared the human sequences with random control sequences ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) of the same length, to understand the onset of finite sample size effects. An infinite random sequence generated subject to π A = π T and π C = π G should exhibit the symmetry phenomenon (similar frequencies for all symmetric pairs), regardless of the word length. A failure to detect this symmetry in a finite sample sequence reveals a limitation in the sample size. The human genome deviates from the symmetry more rapidly than the control sequences. For example, in the complete human genome, the equivalence testing shows that the symmetry phenomenon is statistically significant at least for words of length up to 6nt. As the word length increases, the strength of the symmetry phenomenon in the complete human genome decreases, but does so more rapidly than in the control sequences. In terms of distances between symmetric words, the symmetry remains higher than in the control sequences, at least for 1 < k < 7 . However, for k > 6 , high distance values can be found in both cases (word symmetry distance > 90 % ). The analysis of our results shows that, globally, Chargaff's second parity rule only holds for small oligonucleotides, in the human genome. However, there are some large oligonucleotides for which the extension of Chargaff's second parity holds. We also proposed new methods to evaluate the distance between symmetric words in the sorted frequency vector. The new methods evaluate the word length k s at which symmetry ceases to exist. The results obtained point to similar thresholds ( 5 ≤ k s ≤ 7 ). This suggests that the phenomenon of symmetry is not as strong as previously thought. Furthermore, in the case of RNA, this is especially notorious, even for the smallest word lengths. The deviations from perfect symmetry are more pronounced for large word lengths, for which the sample size limit might become an issue. Therefore, we were careful to subtract this effect from the analysis. We based our conclusions on a set of methods, not on a single one; statistical significance was a major concern; and we systematically used control sequences to detect the onset of problems due to limited sample sizes. We feel that our results provide a broad picture of the symmetry phenomenon in the human genome and the extent to which it holds.

As expected, the application has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be viewed as a tool to help undergraduate students test and assess the Fourier series expansions on a typical set of signals, whose analytical Fourier series coefficients were found during the theoretical lectures. Additionally, students can also control the total approximation error and the number of terms/harmonics used in the expansion.

Unfortunately, sensor integration is far from being simple due to the number of incompatible network specifications and platforms. The adoption of a common, standard communication interface would allow the engineer to abstract the relation between the sensor and the network. This would reduce the development efforts and emerge as an important step towards the adoption of \"plug-and-play\" technology in PA/PV sensor networks. This paper explores this need and introduces a framework for smart data acquisition in PA/PV that relies on the IEEE 1451 family of standards, which addresses the transducer-to-network interoperability issues. The framework includes a ZigBee end device (sMPWiNodeZ), as an IEEE 1451 WTIM (Wireless Transducer Interface Module), and an IEEE 1451 NCAP (Network Capable Application Processor) that acts as gateway to an information service provider and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) coordinator.

Precision viticulture (PV) and precision agriculture (PA) requires the acquisition and processing of a vast collection of data coming typically from large scale and heterogeneous sensor networks. Unfortunately, sensor integration is far from being simple due to the number of incompatible network specifications and platforms. The adoption of a common, standard communication interface would allow the engineer to abstract the relation between the sensor and the network. This would reduce the development efforts and emerge as an important step towards the adoption of “plug-and-play” technology in PA/PV sensor networks. This paper explores this need and introduces a framework for smart data acquisition in PA/PV that relies on the IEEE 1451 family of standards, which addresses the transducer-to-network interoperability issues. The framework includes a ZigBee end device (sMPWiNodeZ), as an IEEE 1451 WTIM (Wireless Transducer Interface Module), and an IEEE 1451 NCAP (Network Capable Application Processor) that acts as gateway to an information service provider and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) coordinator. The paper discusses the proposed IEEE 1451 system architecture and its benefits in PA/PV and closes with results/lessons learned from in-field trials towards smarter WSN. Keywords IEEE 1451 Precision agriculture Precision viticulture Wireless sensor networks Gateway IEEE 802.15.4 1 Introduction PA and PV practices depend on the acquisition, transmission and processing of a vast collection of data coming from a large scale, heterogeneous sensor network (Camilli et al., 2007). These characteristics and the obvious need for wireless data transmission immediately raises two issues. The first is energy-related. The challenge is how to obtain sufficient energy and how to manage it, so that all electronic devices can enjoy virtually uninterruptible operation. Previous work (Morais et al., 2008a,b) gave valuable information on how to support devices that communicate with each other in an IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee mesh network with energy harvesting techniques to power data acquisition devices with multiple sensors. The second issue has to do with the normalization and interoperability related to the multiplicity of sensors, sensor output types, multi-vendor data acquisition platforms and network support. In PA/PV practices there are many sensors with different types of output: voltage, current, wired digital (RS-485, SDI-12) and many other types. This diversity affects the way sensors are integrated in a data acquisition network. The multiplicity of incompatible network specifications and distinctive data acquisition platforms make the integration of heterogeneous sensors far from simple (Tani and Cugnasca, 2005). The adoption of a common and standard communication interface to abstract the sensor/network/user relation would cut down development efforts, reduce installation and configuration complexity, and facilitate the “plug-and-play” of sensors to a network (Oostdyk et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007; Lee, 2008), improving interoperability and reducing the implementation, deployment and maintenance costs. Solutions to meet these challenges would contribute decisively to improve precision viticulture practices. The need for a framework for interoperability to accommodate these systems and support heterogeneous sensor applications using consensus-based standards to connect sensor networks has been noted before (Song and Lee, 2007). Chen and Helal (2008, 2009) had reviewed and analyzed the standards developed to normalize the process of acquiring and handling data from transducers (Echonet, SensorML, DeviceKit, Device Description Language, IEEE Transducer ML and IEEE 1451), and concluded that the IEEE1451 family of standards arises as the most comprehensive. Besides ensuring the appropriate standardization of data and procedures for data acquisition, it also normalizes the process of communications between devices which, in itself, may represent a huge benefit provided that the implementation of these standards is adequately structured with the necessary services support. Our perspective is that the combination in a framework of standards such as IEEE 1451 and IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee will effectively simplify the integration of devices and equipment in a distributed PA/PV environment, which is characterized by heterogeneous data acquisition systems. This will free farmers from the technical issues often met in such systems (Song and Lee, 2007). In line with this perspective, the present paper describes the architecture and implementation of a comprehensive framework that transforms data acquisition platforms and makes possible the “plug-and-play” connection of various sensors. In our opinion, the need for and usefulness of such a framework has been felt for long, but its implementation has been left behind mainly due to the complexity of the IEEE 1451 family of standards. This article is organized as follows: After introducing the problem of interoperability in Section 1, Section 2 presents a brief overview of IEEE 1451 and what benefits can be extracted from the simplification of configuration and use procedures of wireless sensor networks in PA/PV practices. Section 4 presents the hardware and software that have been used and how the MPWiNodeZ platform described in Morais et al. (2008a) has been upgraded to become fully IEEE 1451 compliant. Regarding the WSN sink node, the functional architecture of an in-field gateway, where all services necessary for the implementation of a complete IEEE 1451 system have been incorporated, is also described. Section 5 describes the IEEE 1451 implementation and the sequence of operations needed to interact with a data acquisition platform. In addition, we present a brief description of the IEEE 1451 management tool, developed in Java language, which accesses the in-field gateway and allows to configuring the devices and collect all data from a proof-of-concept WSN. It ends with lessons learned from this research and valuable information on how to implement a complex but comprehensive standard that can be effectively used to create smarter PA/PV technologies. 2 Overview of IEEE 1451 standard Important efforts have been concentrated on the definition, functionality and communication standards for smart sensors. The goal is interoperability for a wide range of applications. The smart sensor, with appropriate local decision-making capability, can act as an intelligent node in a network, with interoperability aimed as the key argument for an obvious need to support various data acquisition platforms across different networks for network independent operation. Such effort would help expedite the development of networked smart transducers. Towards this goal, the IEEE and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) have pioneered the development of a set of standards known as IEEE 1451. The IEEE 1451, a family of Smart Transducer Interface Standards, describes a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers (sensors or actuators) to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks. The key feature of these standards is the definition of Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS), fully described in IEEE Std 1451.0-2007, which stores transducer identification, calibration, correction data, measurement range, manufacture-related information, and other information, which can be remotely retrieved through a common set of interfaces enabling a “plug-and-play” procedure for transducer handling. The characteristics of self-configuration and self-description provided by TEDS help to minimize human errors and by manually entering of data for configuration reduce the need for technical expertise for setting up and maintaining a monitoring system (Oostdyk et al., 2006). A simplified functional structure of a IEEE 1451–based system is depicted in Fig. 1 . IEEE 1451 divides a sensor network system into two general categories of devices, the Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP) and Transducer Interface Module (TIM). NCAP is a processor-based device that acts as a gateway between two levels of a sensor network with two different interfaces. To the lower level, the NCAP exchanges data with a set of TIM devices where transducers are attached through Transducer Channels (TC). To this effect, NCAP incorporates a communications support to ensure connectivity with the TIM according to the communications technologies adopted by the IEEE 1451 family. To the higher level, the NCAP represents the interface of a distributed monitoring system to a higher level of a network where IEEE Std 1451.1-1999 specifies a simple, complete object model for building smart sensor and actuator-based systems. Remote access to WSN data is thus facilitated by a set of standard services and functionalities that form a layer of middleware services for network management applications. Support communications between NCAP and TIM is normalized and described separately by a subset of IEEE 1451, regardless of the subset IEEE 1451.0, where several possibilities exist: point-to-point (IEEE 1451.2), approved wireless radios (IEEE 1451.5), and RFID systems (IEEE 1451.7). The subset IEEE 1451.5 introduces the Wireless Transducer Interface Module (WTIM), a particular case of TIM where communication is based on an approved wireless radio (IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN, Bluetooth or IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee). In any case all the specifications for effective communications are contained in the structures of Physical TEDS (format, fragmentation and packaging methods for the messages used in communications technology). Each TIM includes the TEDS associated with each transducer which completely defines it. Furthermore, the NCAP may request the TIM’s TEDS, in order to interpret correctly each sensor reading, or send TEDS to be stored in each TIM by using any approved communications medium. More information on all TEDS can be found in IEEE Std 1451.0-2007. 3 IEEE 1451 in PA/PV environments PA/PV applications often depend on spatial and temporal variability studies and employ variable rate technology (VRT) to manage crop inputs. Not surprisingly, they show one of the highest rates of adoption of information technology and communications technology in agriculture. In these studies and/or techniques, an enormous amount of data is collected in real-time by sensors that measure a wide variety of parameters related to crop growth. The wide diversity and heterogeneity of available sensors for this purpose places serious difficulties both for end users and manufacturers. The end users have to struggle with the configuration of the recording equipment, and manufacturers need to worry about making their sensors compatible with the majority of the data collection equipment. The adoption of the IEEE 1451 in PA/PV applications aims to simplify these procedures across all distributed and heterogeneous environments. Since the publication of the IEEE 1451 family of standards, several studies have been carried out (Wei et al., 2005; Oostdyk et al., 2006; Nemeth-Johannes et al., 2007; Song and Lee, 2008; Wobschall et al., 2009; Higuera and Polo, 2010; Seng et al., 2011; Barrero et al., in press). Higuera et al. (2009) described an IEEE 1451 implementation of a WSN based on IEEE WSN 802.15.4/ZigBee where WTIMs were implemented using Tmote Sky modules (Moteiv Corporation, USA). NCAP was implemented over the same Tmote Sky module with a USB connection to a computer. The application interface to the sensor network was developed in LabVIEW and it allows the sending of commands to the WTIM and data storage in a database. This work contributes to the enhancement of IEEE Std 1451.5 ZigBee PHY TEDS by adding eleven new registers for ZigBee support. However, it does not take into account PA/PV specificities and only works on transactions initiated by the NCAP, an option that makes impossible sending out data from the WTIM to the NCAP at periodic intervals without the need for pooling the WTIM. Tani and Cugnasca (2005) in turns analyzed the application of IEEE 1451 in PA and how it could help to improve the processes of adoption of WSN and how the various players could benefit from the introduction of standards with interoperability characteristics, and exchange data independently of the communications network. They point out that the various services provided by the IEEE 1451 network element allow for the implementation of two aspects considered essential: the integration of sensors and data acquisition platforms on the same network communications standard and availability of data in SI units. Specifically for PA, Wei et al. (2005) describe a weed sensing system based on IEEE 1451 and ISO 11783, a communication protocol used in many agricultural machines and based on the SAE J1939 protocol (which includes CANbus). The NCAP is connected to other devices using the ISO 11783 bus, which enables connection to non–IEEE 1451–systems. However, only part of the software module that handles the NCAP interface was based on the IEEE 1451.1. It also described the hardware and software of the implemented TIM (IEEE Std 1451.2-1997) and its TEDS. It concludes that IEEE 1451 provides a flexible solution for the integration of embedded systems from different manufacturers. The modular design and “plug-and-play” capability are attractive and so IEEE 1451 may be a major help to speed up further development of PA technologies. In the context of IEEE 1451 and its integration into PA/PV environments, we associate the data acquisition network with WTIM devices and their TC, which correspond to the deployed transducers (sensors and/or actuators). On the other hands, network coordination is left to a NCAP as a part of an in-field gateway, which manages the WTIM devices and performs basic data integration and aggregation. The adoption of the IEEE 1451 viewpoint brings several advantages: • Uniform device description — every device has a corresponding description in the TEDS. As a result, it is always possible to obtain information about any transducer: physical variable, response time and operating modes, among others. • Easier installation and maintenance — incorporation of additional devices is greatly simplified, in a step towards “plug-and-play” capability. The TEDS incorporated in the WTIM supply all the required information in a transparent way to the acquisition system. Replacing or upgrading sensors (for example, to improve accuracy) becomes a simple matter. • Heterogeneity support — IEEE 1451 was conceived with diversity in mind, and in concept it is well suited to the PA/PV scenario, in which the monitoring of a variety of physical variables is the rule. • Data integration and aggregation — the values of the physical variables acquired in the field (temperature, solar irradiance, relative humidity, etc.) can be transmitted in SI units. This distributes the overall required processing and greatly simplifies the processing, integration and aggregation of data. • Diagnostic — The state registers associated with the TIM and their TC allow detecting and report any malfunctions to subsequently carry out any correction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no implementation of this standard in the universe of PA/PV as comprehensive as the one reported in the next sections. For example, we are not aware of any other work in which a WTIM can start a data transaction over an IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network by its own initiative, i.e., without the need for polling by the NCAP. 4 Materials and methods The scenario chosen to incorporate the set of IEEE 1451 standards in a PA/PV environment, and serve as a testbed for developing and testing intelligent data acquisition devices, comprises a set of data acquisition units with all hardware resources needed to implement all IEEE 1451 services over a WSN based on the IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, and an in-field sink node responsible to manage all the data gathering process. Since each analog sensor is not compliant with IEEE 1451, the sMPWiNodeZ data acquisition platform was upgraded to become an IEEE 1451.5 WTIM, where the attached sensors have their TEDS/TC stored in the WTIM memory. In the following sections, the functional architecture of the network used in this research and the most relevant aspects of the implementation are described. 4.1 Architecture overview The solution that we propose to address several frequently occurring problems in WSN for PA/PV applications relies on the sMPWiNodeZ platform and iPAGAT gateway (Peres et al., 2011). A number of sMPWiNodeZ nodes are deployed throughout the area of interest, to monitor and acquire data from a number of possible heterogeneous data sources. The incorporation of IEEE 1451 services in the sensor network yields a new view of it in terms of NCAP and WTIM entities. On one hand, the iPAGAT gateway becomes (or incorporates) the IEEE 1451 NCAP, allowing external data access using IEEE 1451 services through the iPAGAT data integration system. On the other hand, the data acquisition platforms become WTIM entities that operate under IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. Fig. 2 illustrates the functional architecture of a WSN operating under IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee and IEEE 1451.5, from the point of view of the application considered in this work: monitoring a large number of heterogeneous data sources in PA/PV. A set of WTIM is deployed in the field, operating under a network configuration determined by IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. The information about the associated sensors is described in TEDS, eliminating the need to configure the remote system for the correct interpretation of the stored data. The iPAGAT thus becomes one of the central components of this distributed data acquisition system. Firstly, it coordinates all the WTIM to which it is connected over IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, allowing data collection by category. Secondly, it offers an internal set of services that allow data storage in a local database, which can be accessed subsequently by means of external queries. Finally, the network becomes fully scalable since an arbitrary number of iPAGATs is allowed. This brings to our distributed architecture a normalization of the configuration and insertion procedures of the platforms and sensors in the network, greatly simplifying tasks such as sensor upgrading, and therefore cutting down system and maintenance efforts. 4.2 Functional description of the in-field gateway and network nodes The software structure of the iPAGAT gateway was deeply changed to accommodate all necessary IEEE 1451 NCAP services to create a smart, distributed monitoring network. Fig. 3 overviews the inclusion of IEEE 1451 family of standards over an existent IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee WSN accordingly to Fig. 2. As can be seen in this architecture, the NCAP is seen essentially as a gateway between the external network and the remaining elements of the IEEE 1451 system, the WTIM (Wiczer and Lee, 2005). From the point of view of the external network, the WSN manager uses the NCAP IEEE 1451.1 API to access and manage WSN data to fill the iPAGAT local database. To accomplish these goals, the iPAGAT implements the following NCAP services: • IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee physical interface — Hardware device that supports IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee and, being part of iPAGAT, operates as a ZigBee coordinator for creating and managing the WSN. It must also implement the services to add and remove devices from the ZigBee network, manage the communication paths, ensure data exchange, among other; • IEEE 1451.5 services — Software layer that implements IEEE 1451.5 subset responsible for all processing and exchange of messages between NCAP and WTIM when communications are performed on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee; • IEEE 1451.0 services — Software layer that deals with all IEEE 1451.0 services. The NCAP must be able to interpret all information received from each WTIM and sending commands and TEDS for the WTIM and associated TC. It is also required that the NCAP can identify all sensors attached to each WTIM, interpret essential information about sensing units, measurement limits, acquisition times, modes of operation, and other related information; • IEEE 1451.1 services — This layer is an example of an external network interface, allowing remote access to information contained in the NCAP. There are other alternatives including the HTTP protocol described in IEEE 1451.0 subset and a set of Smart Transducer Web Services proposed by Song and Lee (2007). In the architecture represented in Fig. 2, three management levels are shown. At the WSN level, a set of sMPWiNodeZ devices incorporate the necessary IEEE 1451 services to become a WTIM on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee communication technology. Despite being a mesh-type network, i.e., some devices operate as routers, the connection between each WTIM and its NCAP is a logical star which illustrates the abstraction layer that covers all IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network devices. Each sMPWiNodeZ unit can operate as a ZigBee router in which case, as it is only required to transmit network packets, does not require IEEE 1451 services since there is no need to interpret the data. The iPAGAT represents the second level, the entity responsible for in-field collecting and processing data before making them available to the management level, which can coordinate and centralize data from one or more iPAGATs in a distributed architecture. As can be inferred from the observation of Fig. 3, iPAGAT gateway had seen its software structure grow with the inclusion of IEEE 1451 services that builds the NCAP. Its core is now built around a data aggregation engine, a real-time alert system (RTAS) and a WSN manager that makes MySQL data inserts into a local database. Access to iPAGAT, and consequently to the NCAP, is accomplished through its data integration system that grant access to data stored in local database and enables remote gateway configuration. 4.3 The sMPWiNodeZ platform and WTIM services The sMPWiNodeZ platform, illustrated in Fig. 4 , is an upgrade version of the MPWiNodeZ (Morais et al., 2008a) and implements all functions to turn it into a WTIM IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. It has a 32-bit RISC microcontroller with IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee support (JN5148, Jennic, UK) with 128KB RAM, 128KB ROM and 4MB flash memory. In order to meet the energy needs for perpetual operation (when operating as a router) the sMPWiNodeZ platform can use three independent power sources: solar, wind and moving water in irrigation pipes, as described in Morais et al. (2008b), allowing its internal LiPo battery to charge even when the system is in sleep mode. These energy transducers were also specified as IEEE 1451 transducers, where their TC were characterized within the WTIM structure. The protection against excessive discharge of the battery is also carried out by hardware. The system power is provided by a high efficiency DC-DC converter (MAX1673, Maxim Integrated Products, USA) and a second converter is used exclusively for sensors power supply, being activated only when needed for readings. Analog inputs are provided allowing the connection of sensors with voltage output, an input for sensors with frequency output and a digital input for sensors with embedded digital protocol (SPI, I2C). A separate EEPROM (25LC020A, Microchip, USA) has been included for storing all WTIM TEDS. A real-time clock (DS1343, Maxim Integrated Products, USA) provides all timing signals needed for scheduling tasks and time stamps associated with sensor readings. The sMPWiNodeZ platform is ruled by a set of software structures responsible for energy, communications and peripherals management, with special emphasis on reducing energy consumption. Fig. 5 illustrates the structure of software services with emphasis on IEEE 1451 and its relations with the main application. The interface block called Sensors and actuators HW interface is responsible for physical interaction with the transducers, such as their powering, signal conditioning and analog-to-digital conversion. The sMPWiNodeZ platform implements all IEEE 1451.0 services (defines TEDS structure, command and response messages formats and state registers) and IEEE 1451.5 services (responsible for data exchange between a WTIM and NCAP on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee networks). Two types of messages are defined: set and setRsp.The first one is used to send all kinds of data between devices, i.e., TEDS, sensor readings, the register readings, and others, while setRsp messages are used to confirm delivery of data packets and to identify potential errors during the communication process. During data reception several operations are performed (unpacking, error checking and messages defragmentation) before it can be handled by the IEEE 1451.0 layer. When a WTIM sends a message, this layer is responsible for the generation of the appropriate response, i.e., receive data from the lower layer (IEEE 1451.0) and execute the processes needed for it to be sent to the NCAP in the correct format, ensuring their delivery to the recipient. Fig. 6 illustrates the simplified state machine of the sMPWiNodeZ application, illustrating the relationship between IEEE 1451 states, IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee management and power management. After hardware initialization, it is necessary to search for an IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network and connect to its coordinator. Afterwards, all IEEE 1451 layers can be initiated in the state WTIMinitialization. During this state, the IEEE 1451.0 and IEEE 1451.5 services are configured and all existing TC are checked and added to the data structure of the IEEE 1451.0 layer. This process involves the initialization of the state registers, attributes, as well as reading and verification of the TEDS for all WTIM’s and their TC. In its normal operation, the WTIM periodically comes out from WTIMSleep state, checks the available energy and if passed it goes to the WTIMActive state during which the sMPWiNodeZ can receive command messages from the NCAP. The TC associated with each sensor uses a free running sampling mode and the data transmission mode has been set to streaming at fixed intervals. This configuration enables the autonomous sending of readings to the NCAP at regular intervals, without the need for any NCAP polling. If requests from the NCAP are pending, these are processed as soon as the WTIM enters its active state. 4.4 The iPAGAT gateway and NCAP services We consider the iPAGAT to be the key element of the proposed architecture in Fig. 2, since it performs a set of in-field operations and manages simultaneously a set of devices for heterogeneous data gathering. As such, in addition to all the services needed to create a distributed IEEE 1451 system, the iPAGAT implements a set of additional services available to level 3, referred to, in this work, as the farm management level. The iPAGAT can be remotely accessed through the services provided by its embedded data integration system for gateway management, WSN monitoring and configuration. In addition, it provides access to IEEE 1451 NCAP services, such as WTIM discovery, TEDS management, transducer access, transducer management and WSN collected data. The data integration system also enables data queries to the NCAP data as well as iPAGAT aggregated data. It is also possible to monitor each WSN node including traffic, link quality indicator, and available energy using NCAP services. The NCAP was implemented in Java programming language and has been structured into three main components: Network Communication (NC), Transducer Services Interface (TSI) and Module Communication Interface (MCI). The functional architecture is shown in Fig. 7 . The NC component provides a set of services used for communication between any network/external applications and the NCAP. This access can be accomplished by one of three methods (IEEE 1451.1 API, IEEE 1451.0 HTTP Protocol or Smart Transducers Web Services). The method described in IEEE 1451.1 subset defines an object model with a network-neutral interface for connecting processors to communication networks, sensors, and actuators. The TSI component contains the services and methods defined in the IEEE 1451.0 allowing full interoperability at data level. In the application, the class TranducerServicesInterface implements the services TransducerAcess, WTIMDiscovery, TEDSManager, TransducerManager and CommManager allowing a full interaction with WTIM, TC and TEDS. The component MCI implements all IEEE 1451.5 services being constituted by the classes: ModuleCommunicationsInterface, NetTwoWayClient, NetOneWaySubscriber and NetOneWayPublisher. The ModuleCommunicationsInterface class implements the interfaces NetComm, NetRegistration, NetReceive and holds a current list of NCAP’s registered WTIM and their properties. NetTwoWayClient class is used for bidirectional communications initiated by NCAP, while NetOneWaySubsciber and NetOneWayPublisher classes are used in one-way communication between WTIM and NCAP and vice-versa. At a lower level, ZigBeeCommModule and RS232 classes performs the interface with the IEEE802.15.4/ZigBee WSN coordinator. The ZigBeeCommModule class checks for the arrival of new messages and their validity. It is also responsible for managing the WSN coordinator and processing incoming messages, while managing pending ones. The use of ZigBeeCommModule class allows greater independence between the MCI component and radio technology adopted. The RS232 class consists of two separate processes responsible for receiving and sending messages to and from the WSN coordinator through an RS232 serial interface. In Section 5, these events are illustrated. Fig. 8 illustrates a simplified view of the state machine regarding the implementation of all IEEE 1451 services in the iPAGAT. When it starts, the NCAP obtains its initial settings stored in the iPAGAT database (MCI type, max number of TIMs, MCI and TSI name descriptions, etc.). IEEE 1451.1 and IEEE 1451.0 services are then initiated as well as the IEEE 1451.5 communications module. After initiation of the network coordinator and registering of the NCAP communications module, the ZigBee PAN network is ready to accept new network elements. After the registration of the communications module, it becomes active and waits for new WTIM announcements. In this case, the NCAP is notified of a registration request by the ZigBee stack which is responsible for assigning an address to the new WTIM. When processing the registration request, the NCAP query the iPAGAT database to validate the WTIM and proceeds to the WTIM registration by requesting all TEDS in the WTIM to identify all the channels and associated units. Whenever the WTIM announcement event is generated by a reconnection, NCAP checks whether the WTIM had any TC in the operate state proceeding to its activation automatically. The services provided by the IEEE 1451.1 API allows sending commands and TEDS for the WTIM and the reception of TEDS from the WTIM. In order to ensure faultless operation, the NCAP and the sink node are monitored by a service module (NCAP maintenance) at regular time intervals. The simplified data model for supporting the entire structure of IEEE 1451 data is divided by functional group: data tables and WSN management tables (subdivided into monitoring and configuration). The data collected by the WSN are stored in a table called sensordata. This table encapsulates the values, in SI units, the associated geographical and temporal context and a field used to index the measurement units. This table feeds the iPAGAT data aggregation engine comprising a local 7-day long WSN data warehouse available through the data integration system. A table called aggdata stores the last sensor reading, time stamps, the maximum and minimum daily values, their ocurrence times, and the average daily value. More details can be found in Peres et al. (2011). The tables that belong to the management group allow the WSN manager to monitor and configure the network, providing the Management Information Base (MIB) for the entire integrated management platform. The monitoring table contains a snapshot of the network status at a given time (topology, packets sent and received, the battery voltage levels of each WTIM and the time stamp of the last connection). It allows the history of the network and its elements to be traced in time. An incidents table stores possible occurrences detected by the network manager (e.g. loss of connectivity of a WTIM). Monitoring group tables store dynamic information about the WSN manager. The configuration group comprises the ipagat, ncap, tims and channels tables. The configuration parameters of the iPAGAT, NCAP, deployed TIMs and their TC are stored here. The NCAP table includes all IEEE 1451 device properties, including the ZigBee coordinator configuration and MCI and TSI software modules. The TIM and TC tables characterize each data acquisition platform and its channels, including TEDS, IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee network address, the geographical coordinates of each deployed TIM and the types of the sensors used per channel. 5 Experiments and results In this section we describe and discuss some of the experiments and results obtained with the system described, emphasizing the role of the mesh-type ZigBee WSN and its in-field gateway, in the light of the IEEE 1451 framework. The experimental setup has been deployed in the campus of the Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal, since May 2009. In reference to the present paper, it consists of six nodes, one of which is the NCAP (iPAGAT). The remaining nodes are WTIMs (sMPWiNodeZ). At the ZigBee network level, four devices operate as end-devices and one device as a router. Fig. 9 illustrates all devices in the WSN. The WTIMs were fitted with four TC sensors and four embedded TC actuators to configure the period of time between data acquisitions. The TC includes a temperature sensor LM50B, the battery voltage, the solar irradiance obtained through the solar panel and a channel used to transmit management data (battery voltage, Link Quality Indicator (LQI), bytes sent/received, parent and status bits) to the NCAP. In order for the sMPWiNodeZ platform to operate as a WTIM, we configured it with the appropriate MetaTEDS, XdcrName and PHYTEDS. For each of the TC, the corresponding ChanTEDS and XdcrName were also configured, with the help of the TEDSManager application (Matos et al., 2012). The management of the iPAGAT gateway or gateways (there can be one or several) and its components is performed remotely at the farm management layer (L3 in Fig. 2) using the Java application iPAGATRemoteManager, which accesses the services provided by the gateway layer (WSNservices) and enables a set of management and data collection tasks (real-time monitoring, configuration, status and historical events). Tasks such as IEEE 1451 NCAP configuration, management zones or even selected variables used by the data aggregation engine (form frmIPAGATConfig) are performed within this application. Fig. 10 illustrates the general appearance of the application. The main window uses the frmTree form to display all elements of the integrated management platform. The data exchanged between the application and the selected iPAGAT is shown below that (frmCommunications). The WSN incidents are shown at the bottom (frmIncidents). The device tree, displayed in more detail in Fig. 10, allows an intuitive interaction with the iPAGAT, with the NCAP, WTIM and their TC as well as the several TEDS configured in WTIM and TC clearly visible. The monitoring of the WSN nodes uses a map as its central structuring element. The map provides a simple and intuitive interface to the WSN elements (iPAGAT and their WTIM). The logical connections between elements, summary information and status of each component (address, coordinates, etc.) are all represented and geo-referenced. It is also possible to observe traffic data between iPAGAT and each WTIM and display the battery voltage of each one as well as its LQI. The monitoring can be performed over a specified time period, but real-time monitoring is also possible. It is also possible to generate CSV (Comma Separated Values) reports to a file. All of these WTIM dynamic data monitoring options are available using the interface shown in Fig. 11 . The interface frmTIMConfig shown in Fig. 12 , allows full WTIM/TC configuration. In addition, some useful information is presented such as WTIM network address, location and date of the last connection, and TEDS/TC of selected WTIM. It is also possible to display all mandatory IEEE 1451.0 (MetaTEDS, XdcrName, ChanTEDS) and IEEE 1451.5 (PHYTEDS) TEDS. There is an additional feature that we have found useful: it is possible to send TEDS for a specific WTIM and/or TC; activate (operate state) or deactivate (idle state) a specific channel, or even change the TC acquisition time period. In the case of sensors that may be added by the user to a sMPWiNodeZ platform, their TEDS and TC may be remotely configured using the iPAGATRemoteManager and downloaded to the WTIM through the network or be programmed through the TEDSManager tool. Two distinct transactions types between the NCAP and a WTIM may occur. The transmission of a command to each WTIM for configuration or actuation purposes is one type. The other type is the periodic transmission of acquired data by each WTIM, an important capability because it avoids the need for the NCAP to poll each WTIM in the network (as described by Higuera et al. (2009)). Fig. 13 illustrates in a precise way the timing of the sequence of operations needed to send a command from the NCAP to a WTIM following the IEEE 1451.0 specification. Examples of such remote configuration commands are WTIM configuration, calibration, enabling/disabling TC and setting acquisition period. For instance, in order to instruct a sensor to perform periodic readings, one simply needs to activate its TC by sending an operate command to the WTIM. Besides the associated TC/sensor, an embedded pair of virtual TC/actuator was created as an IEEE 1451.0 control group. This procedure enables the setting of the sampling acquisition period using the same procedure, i.e., by sending a command to the embedded virtual actuator where the parameter is the desired time period. This is an important improvement because it normalizes all WSN related procedures, an important step towards interoperability. Once configured, the TC proceeds to trigger sensor readings at periodic time intervals and sends each sample value to the NCAP without any need for polling. The diagram in Fig. 14 illustrates the process of receiving a new sensor data from the WTIM. Once received, decoded and processed by the several NCAP modules, data are stored in the iPAGAT database through the module WSNmanager. The command/response pairs and message formats are described in Fig. 15 as an example when a temperature sensor connected to a WTIM sends data with a sampling interval set to 300s. The first three pairs describe WTIM configuration operations and the last one illustrates the transmission of the sensor reading to the NCAP. If the sensor is associated with channel 1 (TC) of the WTIM, then, to start collecting data, the corresponding TC must be activated, that is, placed in the operate state. To change the state of the TC, a sequence of events must take place. Among other functions, this allows switching on and off the sensor, define the period of time between readings, and, in the case of an actuator, to change its output status. These sequences of events clearly show that normalization of the command sending procedures and data reception by all network elements is an enormous advantage that follows from the application of the IEEE 1451 family of standards. The implementation of TC in the WTIM considerably simplifies the tasks of designing, implementing and managing heterogeneous sensor networks, such as those used in PA/PV. The implementation of the NCAP as part of iPAGAT made available all of its services and potential. An example is the iPAGAT alarm or warning system. We explored it to implement a message service that allows the automatic sending of e-mail reports about the iPAGAT activities. This may include issues reported by the 1451 subsystem or ZigBee. Fig. 16 illustrates two such warning messages: one is triggered when the iPAGAT is powered up, the other is when the communication with a WTIM is lost. 6 Discussion The IEEE 1451 family of standards is very comprehensive but also very complex, a fact that has not always helped to make it quickly and widely adopted. However, despite the perceived complexity of these standards, they do provide a number of important advantages which make the implementation effort worthwhile. We have already discussed some of the IEEE 1451 advantages in the context of PA/PV. The authors have a long term interest in PA/PV, mainly targeted to the Douro region in the Northeast of Portugal, one of the oldest (if not the oldest) demarcated wine-producing regions in Europe. The unique characteristics of the region, the technical challenges set by PA/PV and its important benefits (environmental, economical, etc.) have made our task both difficult and interesting. This article is one in a series of works that the group has carried out (Morais et al., 2008a,b; Cunha et al., 2010; Peres et al., 2011). The technological solutions that we have described provide added value in PA/PV, particularly in reference to the study of variability in PA/PV practices. We have considered topics ranging from power issues (energy harvesting, power management, etc.) to networking issues (overall architecture, software, hardware). More recently, increasingly aware of the complexity and costs hidden in the deployment, management and maintenance of heterogeneous WSN, we came to appreciate normalized procedures that could simplify these tasks. This work is considered by its authors as the first practical, full IEEE 1451 application in PA/PV and a privileged framework under which new applications can be easily tried. As far as we know, this is the first time that the IEEE 1451 standards are incorporated in already existing devices, as a way of creating an open framework for interoperability. Although analog sensors are not intrinsically compatible with the IEEE 1451 standards, the combination iPAGAT/NCAP allows the creation of smart, easy-to-configure systems. Each wireless data acquisition platform becomes a sensor node (WTIM) with a smart TC, replacing multiple isolated sensors. The addition or removal of sensors or actuators in a totally automatic way is still limited by the WTIM hardware, but with products in which sensors are already embedded, the entire configuration process can proceed according to the IEEE 1451 standard. This allows for the development of software components (drivers) for sensor networks. As a result of the lessons learned from this work, we are now considering the specification of an interface of reconfigurable hardware under the command of the WTIM, which might allow the connection of an analog sensor and the remote configuration of the system for its incorporation. 7 Conclusions One of the conclusions that can be extracted from our study is that IEEE 1451 is powerful when correctly integrated in devices that acquire, store and process heterogeneous data. The incorporation of IEEE 1451 services in the data acquisition devices allows the use of TEDS in all sensors, significantly simplifying the configuration procedures. The selection, at the NCAP level, of the sensors associated with each WTIM is enough to make “plug-and-play” a reality. In our implementation, we have found that the module that interacts with the transducers is very important. It complements the work very well since it allows the automatic configuration of the interfaced devices. Depending on the TEDS of the transducer, the hardware of the acquisition platform can be configured to accommodate the selected sensor. We have found that this property is particularly useful and important, given the wide range of output types that sensors in PA/PV may exhibit. Another important conclusion extracted from this work is that a full implementation of the complex set of IEEE 1451 standards is possible for WSN based on 802.11, 802.15.4, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and 6LoWPAN as cited in the references, but may be difficult for today’s ultra-low power embedded system technology. This may change in the near future as the technology evolves. However, the standardization is still crucial for the management of heterogeneous data. The simplicity in handling the data collected by WSN that support IEEE 1451 over IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee networks shows very clearly that the IEEE 1451 family of standards is very well suited to the universe of PA/PV and to meet its needs.

Their combined effects corrupt the image by inserting elements that do not belong to the real object and distort the contrast. This hinders the possibility of using the images for visualization, recognition, and analysis using the three-dimensional data. The algorithms developed to restore the lost frequencies and perform band extrapolation, in general, assume absence of noise or an additive noise. This paper presents a restoration approach through band extrapolation and deconvolution that deals with the noise. An extrapolation algorithm using constraints on both spatial and frequency domains with a smoothing operator were combined with the Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm. The results of the method for simulated data are compared with those obtained by the original Richardson-Lucy algorithm and also regularized by Total Variation. The extrapolation of frequencies is also analyzed both in synthetic and in real images. The method improved the results with higher signal-to-noise ratio and quality index values, performing band extrapolation, and achieving a better visualization of the 3D structures. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",

Despite the benefits of precision agriculture and precision viticulture production systems, its rate of adoption in the Portuguese Douro Demarcated Region remains low. We believe that one way to raise it is to address challenging real-world problems whose solution offers a clear benefit to the viticulturist. For example, one of the most demanding tasks in wine making is harvesting. Even for humans, the environment makes grape detection difficult, especially when the grapes and leaves have a similar color, which is generally the case for white grapes. In this paper, we propose a system for the detection and location, in the natural environment, of bunches of grapes in color images. This system is able to distinguish between white and red grapes, and at the same time, it calculates the location of the bunch stem. The system achieved 97% and 91% correct classifications for red and white grapes, respectively. Keywords Grape detection Visual inspection Precision viticulture Image processing 1 Introduction Variable management practices within the field according to site-specific conditions can be promoted through the concept of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Precision Viticulture (PV). It is based on new tools and information sources provided by modern technologies, such as yield monitoring devices, soil, plant and pest sensors and remote sensing [3]. PA and PV generally have two main objectives: to render the production more cost-effective and to reduce its environmental impact. The first objective can be achieved by reducing production costs and improving productivity. The second objective relates to the accuracy and the ability to control the application of production factors, such as chemicals, which should be done within a fair measure of the real needs of crops. The rate of adoption of these technological tools varies considerably from country to country, and from region to region [23]. In addition to environmental benefits, such as those related to better water and nutrient management, PA and PV systems can increase worker productivity, augment product throughput and improve selection reliability and uniformity. Additionally, the use of robotic systems in agriculture has seen a sharp increment in recent years. Many systems have been described for the automation of various harvesting processes, such as for fruit location, detachment and transfer, among other, [22]. They have been used in the harvesting of, for example, melons [11], cucumbers [12], tomatoes [16] and oranges [18]. For a survey of several aspects of these systems see, for example, [14] and [20]. According to the report of the US Department of Energy [1], the wine industry is interested in using autonomous robotic systems for grape harvesting, phytosanitary treatments, among other very time and human resources consuming tasks, for multiple reasons; this also happens to be true for the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) of Portugal, as explained below. Harvesting conditions, in particular, affect wine quality, and several techniques need to be used in order to produce quality wines, and including scheduling details [2], and ending up with production details [15]. Soft computing methods and techniques have been used in virtually all fields of science. They have been successfully applied to the detection of lifetime building thermal insulation failures [21], neural visualization of network traffic data for intrusion detection [8], identification of typical meteorological days [6], enhanced data visualization [7], to name only a few. Visual inspection methods can also be used to locate grapes for harvesting. Unfortunately, the location process is much easier for fruits than for vine grapes (see, for example, [19]), even if soft computing techniques like the ones listed above are used. The environment makes grape detection difficult even for humans, especially when the grapes and leafs have similar colors, as is the case for white grapes. To an automatic recognition application, the grapes can appear at different scales, they can be partially hidden by leafs, the luminance of images can vary widely due to the sun, clouds, leafs, and so on. We have tried different pattern recognition techniques in order to try to solve these problems. Many works have been devoted to the definition of object invariant descriptors for simple geometric transformations; see, for example, [13]. The Zernike moments [5] have been developed to overcome the major drawbacks of regular geometrical moments regarding noise effects and image quantization error. Zernike moments were successfully used in the detection of red grapes [4], but nothing is known about their performance in connection with white grapes. Moreover, besides the difficulties associated with the calculation of the Zernike moments, the method proposed by [4] implies two distinct phases, training and recognition, the training phase being crucial to the results of the whole system. The computation time for the learning step, for 17 images, is reported to take 5 minutes on a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4. The computation time for the recognition step (identification of each block of size 16 × 16 pixels) takes less than one second. We have tried to use Zernike moments to detect white grapes but the results were disappointing (less than 50% of correct classifications). In this paper we present a simple method for the detection and location, in natural environment, of bunches of grapes in color images, using only very simple and basic image processing techniques. The system is able to distinguish between white and red grapes, and also to work at night (with very little, or none, light/brightness variation). Additionally, the system can calculate the location of the bunch stem, which can be used to help guiding a harvesting robot. The system presented here represents part of an effort that is being made by our team to help introducing PA and PV in the farmersʼ everyday practices in the DDR [17], and is intended to be used in an autonomous harvesting robotic system. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present the DDR unique characteristics, which definitely shaped and constrained the system. Section 3 is used to present the proposed system. Its performance and efficiency are discussed in Section 4, where experimental results obtained with real images are given. Section 5 presents some conclusions and discusses future work. 2 The DDR unique characteristics and their impact on the system The DDR is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the oldest Wine Demarcated Region of the World, where Port wine is actually produced and then shipped to the city of Oporto. Due to its unique characteristics, it poses very specific challenges, mainly connected with its topographic profile, pronounced climatic variations and complex soil characteristics. It is located in northeast Portugal, and consists mostly of steep hills (slopes reaching 15%) and narrow valleys that flatten out into plateaux above 400 m. The Douro river dug deeply into the mountains to form its bed, and the dominant element of the landscape are the vineyards, planted in terraces fashioned from the steep rocky slopes and supported by hundreds of kilometers of drystone wall. Vineyards in the DDR are characterized by their small area size, and by having more than one caste per parcel and even for bard, particularly in the case of old vines. The more recent vines were projected and organized having in mind better control of the number and type of castes. Still, more than 120 (both white and red grapes) different castes are used in the region. Grape harvest and disease predictions, as well as the assessment of the grape value, are currently left to the grape-growers, without the help of decision-support mechanisms, in an environment where no significant irrigation systems exist. Traditionally, vineyards have been harvested by humans. However, harvesting is a hard work, particularly in a region with the topographic and climatic characteristics of the DDR. The manpower needs are large and it is more and more difficult to find qualified workers. Autonomous systems could not only reduce the harvesting cost and manpower needs but they could also be conceived to work during the night. There is however one important constraint: although it is not essential that the workpower of the harvesting robot surpasses that of a human, it is crucial that they satisfy quality control levels at least similar to those achieved by humans. Also, the existing machines harvest grapes by striking the vine, a process that is not recommended for some wines, such as champagne, for chemical reasons (e.g., oxidation) but also because of some deposits being collected with the grapes. These harvesting machines need, at least, one operator. They also require previous preparation of the vineyard, such as cutting the tips. By contrast, the system presented in this paper is intended to be used in an autonomous robotic system, without previous preparation of the vineyard, which helps to keep the cost of the solution down to a minimum. It is part of an effort made by our team to help introducing or spreading PA and PV in the farmersʼ everyday practices in the DDR [9,17]. We wanted a system able to work during the night, with very little, or none, light/brightness variation. We also wanted the system to distinguish red from white grapes, because in the DDR red and white grapes are commonly found in the same parcel and even the same bard, and therefore telling one from the other is essential for correct harvesting. 3 The grape recognition system We came to realize early in our work that if we could solve the problem of detecting bunches of white grapes we could also solve the problem of detecting red grapes. The reasons will become clear from the results section. Consequently, we have focused our efforts on the detection of bunches of white grapes. For the reasons explained in the previous section, we wanted the whole system to be able to work at night (i.e., in the darkness, with very little, or none, light/brightness variations), and also have the ability to distinguish between red and white grapes. To this end, the system simply makes a first pass through the original (night captured) image, counting the number of pixels that are “inside” limits of the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) components of ( 044 , 051 , 064 ), ( 033 , 041 , 054 ), ( 055 , 062 , 075 ), and ( 018 , 024 , 036 ), for red grapes, and ( 102 , 108 , 089 ), ( 095 , 104 , 085 ), ( 076 , 090 , 078 ), and ( 083 , 089 , 038 ) for white grapes. These four central values (colors) were experimentally (trial and error) determined during the development phase. The system looks for pixels within the “limits” of these central values: the default limit contains all the values within 8% of these central values for red grapes and 15% for white grapes (these were the values experimentally determined from the night captured images). The largest counts indicate the type of grape, i.e., red or white. However, if initial conditions are known, i.e., if we know that a parcel consists of a single type of grape (say white), then the system can be switched to that type of grape mode (say white mode), skipping the grape identification phase. Most vineyards in the DDR have small areas, and, as said before, they may also contain more than one type of grape (red or white and even different castes) per parcel and even per bard, particularly in the case of old vines. Once the type of grape (red or white) is established, the system follows three additional steps: color mapping, morphological dilation, black areas and stem detection. The color mapping step is done based on the conditions established during the grape identification step. At the end of this step we will have a binary image (black for the pixels in the range and white for the other pixels). Fig. 1 (a) shows the original image, containing bunches of red grapes, and Fig. 1(b) presents the resulting image of the application of color mapping step. The resulting image from this step does not generally have a uniform (continuous) black region, see Fig. 1(b), but several regions, where the concentration of black pixels is greater. The morphological dilation operation is meant to fill in the gaps between the pixels, yielding uniform black regions. We have used a square of 3 × 3 pixels as the structuring element, typically one of the most simple and used structuring elements. We should recall that the shape of this structuring element is not very far from the shape of a grape berry. Because the regions resulting from the color mapping step when applied to red grapes and white grapes are very different, with a greater sparsity when dealing with white grapes, we have typically used 60 iterations of the morphological dilation for red grapes, and 100 iterations for white grapes. Fig. 2 (a) shows the resulting image after the dilation operation, applied to the image presented in Fig. 1(b). Obviously, we have tried different sizes for the structuring element, but when its size was increased, even with a lower number of morphological dilation iterations, the number of overlapping uniform black regions tends to increase; these overlaps will correspond to incorrect overlapping bunches, leading to incorrect identifications. The final step is used to detect and numbering the black regions, and locate the bunch stem. First, the number of contiguous regions are counted and labeled (numbered) using 8-connectivity. Then, for each region, its width, height and area are calculated (in pixels) so that we can discard false detections of very small bunches or very large regions to contain only one bunch of grapes. Note that in this last case the region will be composed of two or more bunches and the system will need to capture more images (from different angles) to correctly handle these situations. Now, these parameters, and also the total number of admissible areas, are all adjustable. Next, we count the number of regions, center, area, width, height, perimeter and boundaries, for each region. For each region, and based on the pixel distribution and density around its center, it is determined the “horizontal” (width) and “vertical” (height) axes of the bunch, i.e., the bunch orientation. Then, with these axes (and orientation), and with the regionʼs limits, we locate the bunch stem. Fig. 2(b) shows the resulting image after the final step and Fig. 3 shows another example consisting of the original image and the resulting identification. 4 Results and discussion All images presented here and used to test the system were captured during the night, with a Panasonic FZ28 camera simply using its internal flash, i.e., no other lightning system was used. By capturing the images during the night we avoid any spurious reflections or bad illumination during sunny day time, like momentary presence of clouds, but also, as explained above, some important wine chemical properties (e.g., oxidation). In total, there were 190 images containing bunches of white grapes, and 35 images of red grapes (the number of images containing bunches white grapes is much higher than that of red grapes because the identification of bunches of red grapes is much simpler, as explained above). A summary of the results can be seen in Table 1 . As we can see, there were 172 correct results for bunches of white grapes; this means that all bunches present in each of these 172 images were correctly identified. We emphasize this fact, because we want that in a near future this system can be part of a harvesting robot, and we know that most of the infield images captured by this robot could contain more than one bunch per image, which clearly is not an optimal situation, but rather real. Recall that in a practical infield situation the robot can take as many images as needed to ensure that no more bunches are present for harvesting. However, we also have 18 images with incorrect or false detections. This means that the system classified some areas of the image as if they were bunches although no bunches at all were present, or missed the identification of an existing bunch. Also, if two regions were merged during the morphological dilation process they were counted as an “incorrect” result. As we have foreseen, the systemʼs performance, in percentage, is better for bunches of red grapes than for white grapes. Recall that the color of red grapes is very different (contrasting) from their surroundings (e.g., color of the leaves); however one must note the small number of red grape sample images. The system can also be used to help guiding the robot. As it can be seen in Fig. 4 , although the picture was captured very far way form the grape bunches the system manages to identify the presence of bunches of grapes. So, the system can help to tell the robot to move along that direction, adjusting (fine tuning) its position or trajectory. Usually, the presence of many bunches of grapes in one image indicates that the robot is at a considerably far distance from those bunches. Obviously, this can only be a contribution to the robotʼs trajectories or positioning. In the examples of Figs. 5 and 6 , for example, we can see that the bunch in the center of the figure is correctly identified. However, we can see that there are more bunches to be harvested. By capturing one more image after the harvesting of the central bunch the system will detect the presence of more bunches and then correct the robots trajectory, as in the previous situation. As noted before, the presence of leaves may (partially) occlude a bunch; in these cases a mechanic system like the one presented in [10], basically a blower/fan to remove leaves, can be used to help solve this problem. We have tested the system on a computer running Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, with an Intel Core Duo Processor T2300 at 1.66 GHz, Mobile Intel 945 PM Express Chipset, 3 GB DDR2 667 MHz SDRAM, and NVDIA GeForce Go 7300 External 128 MB VRAM video card. In order to reduce the identification time, we tested several image resolutions, as presented in Table 2 . With a resolution of 1.3 megapixel (MP) the system is able to produce the same results as with a 10 megapixel resolution. Note that the identification of bunches of red grapes takes less time, because it uses a lower number of iterations during the dilation operation step. 5 Conclusions and ongoing work Within the context of precision agriculture/viticulture, and because the Douro Demarcated Region has its own very particular characteristics, a vision inspection system was developed in order to identify bunches of grapes, for later inclusion in a robotic system for night conditions harvesting. The system is also able to automatically distinguish between white and red grapes, and has achieved 97% and 91% of correct classifications, for red and white grapes, respectively. Additionally, it can also calculate the location of the bunch stem, and can be used to help the robotʼs location and guiding system. Concerning the identification algorithm we are trying to make it more flexible. For example, during the morphological dilation step, the number of iterations should depend on the merging of the different regions, i.e., the iteration process should stop if the regions are already contiguous or if two distinct regions are merged. Also, the tilling and distribution of these contiguous regions should be analyzed in order to prevent incorrect identifications, like two or more staked regions, regions with much greater width than wight, among other. Obviously, a dedicated (specific) lighting system may help in producing better identification results (starting with a simple diffuser), but it would also increase the system cost and needed resources (e.g., power supply). We are also currently testing multi-spectral cameras. This solution is far more expensive, but it could bring information about grapes maturation and alcoholic level. A cheaper alternative may include infra-red cameras, but red grapes yield more thermal information than white grapes, and so, once again, the identification of red grapes seems simpler than white grapes. In addition to the tasks of detection and harvesting, the robotic system may also contribute to mitigate the environmental impact of chemical plant protection products, as its application by robotic systems would be made only at points of interest identified by the vision system, among other possible applications (pruning, trimming the vines, disease detection, etc.).

We give some examples that illustrate the method and show that these information sequences may reveal important structural properties of the DNA sequences.

We argue that the approach is of interest for challenging image applications but we identify one obstacle: standard high-performance image compression methods are not normal, and normal methods such as Lempel-Ziv type algorithms might not perform well for images. To demonstrate the potential of compression-based similarity measures we propose an algorithm that is based on finite-context models and works directly on the intensity domain of the image.

White grapes are particularly difficult to detect, since their color is similar to that of the leafs.

We found out that the divergence between the distribution of the distances of a dinucleotide and that of its reversed complement is very small, indicating that these distance distributions are very similar. This is an interesting finding that might give evidence of a stronger parity rule than the one provided by Chargaff's second parity rule. Furthermore, we also compared the distance distribution of each dinucleotide to a reference distribution, that of a random sequence generated with the same dinucleotide abundances, revealing the CG dinucleotide as the one with the highest cumulative relative error for the first 60 distances. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Keywords Precision agriculture Wireless sensor networks Gateway Data aggregation and integration Site-specific management Service-oriented computing 1 Introduction Precision agriculture (PA) and precision viticulture (PV) involve using electronic, communication and information technologies to collect large amounts of data in the field to use in site-specific crop management (Stafford, 2000). Wireless sensors are considered the best technology to gather the massive amounts of data needed, for example, to understand production variability (Camilli et al., 2007) or estimate growth profiles (Moreenthaler et al., 2003). Arranged to form widespread ad hoc networks, known as wireless sensor networks (WSN), they have been used to assist in spatial data collection, precision irrigation, variable-rate technology and in supplying data to farmers (Lamb and Bramley, 2001; Wang et al., 2006). However, these technologies are still far from being firmly established in agricultural practice and farming enterprises (Kitchen, 2007). The volume and nature of the data introduce a significant challenge in the development of WSN in PA. Massive amounts of raw data do not necessarily yield proportional amounts of information. There are obvious difficulties in interpreting the data involved in order to reach a better understanding of the causes of variability and in proposing sound strategies for field variability management (Murakami et al., 2007; Rundel et al., 2009; Bramley, 2009). The nature of the data also brings difficulties: the data are heterogeneous and the management of heterogeneous data sources poses specific problems (Plant, 2001). The task of getting meaningful information from many disparate sensors is not trivial (Ibrahim et al., 2005). Energy and networking issues need also to be considered. Typically, a large and remote agricultural area has to be covered with small data acquisition devices, which must harvest energy to run (Morais et al., 2008b). Each device faces severe power constraints, and the coverage of large areas may only be possible if several levels of internetworking are combined to achieve a higher level of network performance and scalability. To better manage the data and address the networking and scalability issues we propose to carry data aggregation and data integration in the field, close to the WSN. This implies the creation of an intermediate layer of aggregation nodes that manage the sensor networks and perform local data integration and supervision functions. The goal of this paper is to describe an intelligent gateway (iPAGAT) that implements this intermediate layer and the underlying data processing functions. The gateway provides capabilities that we consider critical to the success of PV and PA in general: hierarchical networking, remote management, in situ interactions, Internet access and site-specific management tools. It also helps to convert the raw bits into useful information for the farmer and to distribute the processing load. The intermediate layer fits very well to the demands of power-constrained wireless sensors and provides a link between the sensors and the central office or decision center: a link that we regard as critical but that has largely been missing. This paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the motivation in more detail and puts the paper in perspective with respect to the state-of-the-art, focusing on the hierarchical management of agricultural zones, the use of WSN in distributed monitoring of the environment and in-field data processing topics. The material and methods section describes the iPAGAT gateway in detail: its hardware and features, the communication capabilities and the software architecture. The experiments and results section gives a detailed account of the experiments performed to evaluate the gateway as well as some results achieved with the current implementation. The paper closes with the conclusion and discussion section, which summarises our findings and highlights the main contributions of this research. 2 Motivation and background 2.1 WSN in distributed monitoring of the environment The advantages of using WSN technologies to assist PA/PV practices (Wang et al., 2006) are far reaching and motivating. Unfortunately, the effective and general deployment of wireless sensing devices remains constrained by energy requirements and networking issues (Thomas et al., 2006; Raghunathan et al., 2006). Because of this, practical implementations often use some sort of sink node or base station (usually free of energy restrictions) to collect and relay data from field WSNs to upper data processing layers, typically relegated to a remote location. Smart irrigation systems are a good example of this. They are among the most frequently used WSN applications. The sensors are used to assess the hydrological status of the soil and control the site-specific irrigation process. For instance, Vellidis et al. (2008) present a low-cost sensor array that is used to assess soil moisture contents in a cotton crop and transmit sensor data wirelessly to a centralised receiver, which works as the sink node. Kim et al. (2008) describe an irrigation system that uses wireless devices to acquire soil humidity data samples and send them to an in-field base station, which performs the decision-making required for an efficient use of the irrigation water. The use of WSN technology to study the variability in vineyards is reported by Beckwith et al. (2004). They describe a 65-node, 8-hop depth network deployed across a 2-acre vineyard that is used to acquire and transmit temperature data to a base station within the managed zone, for the purpose of studying frost pocket, cold patterns and heat unit accumulation differences and their effect on Vitis vinifera grapes. The NAV system (Matese et al., 2009) consists of a base agrometeorological station (Master Unit, placed in a representative site) and a series of peripheral wireless nodes (Slave Units), up to a maximum of 20, located in the vineyard. It adopts a proprietary wireless technology that uses the ISM 433MHz band and a proprietary half-duplex data transfer protocol for communication with the Slave Units. In this implementation, the Master Unit stores all of the Slave Units data and is able to forward them to a remote central server, using a GSM/GPRS device. Mainwaring et al. (2002), Suri et al. (2006) and Rundel et al. (2009) examine the requirements of environmental WSN used to monitor wildlife habitats. In addition to hardware design and energy issues, their research also focuses on the remaining general key issues that should be considered for the effective deployment of scalable WSNs: hierarchical networking, remote management, in situ interactions and Internet access, among other aspects. The concept of Field Server is explored by Fukatsu and Hirafuji (2005), who introduced a sensor-node equipped with a web server and a wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11b/g) to create a remote field monitoring system. Each Field Server is a standalone device that provides Internet access with hotspot capabilities. This solution can provide ubiquitous networking in PA/PV environments but the devices need to be permanently connected to their neighbourhoods, adding to the energy needs. 2.2 Hierarchical management of agricultural zones Proprietary solutions regarding data communications protocols can always be effectively employed but are often the rule in the case of emerging and/or experimental technologies. Industry standards have important and well-known advantages and are usually associated with more mature stages of development. Wireless personal area networks (WPAN) are no exceptions to this. The lack of standardisation in WPAN lead the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) to design the IEEE 802.15.4 WPAN family of standards, intended for low-power, low bandwidth sensor applications (IEEE, 2006; Baronti et al., 2007). IEEE 802.15.4 enables the creation of complex ad hoc networks, allowing ultra-low power devices, with very short wake-up times at very low cost. This standard assumes that the payload transmitted is short and that transmissions occur at a low duty-cycle. These characteristics are adequate for applications that require a very long battery life or even the combination of energy harvesting techniques with rechargeable batteries (Rundel et al., 2009; Morais et al., 2008a,b). Within an IEEE 802.15.4 WPAN, the network is created and managed by a unique network coordinator, which acts as a sink node to all network nodes. This makes the standard suitable for clustered and mesh WSN architectures. From the management zone perspective, López et al. (2009) present a field implementation of a horticultural crop monitoring network that uses gateways to relay data from in-field WSN back to a base station located at the farm offices. Temperature, relative humidity, electrical conductivity, soil moisture and salinity are among the parameters that are measured by sensing nodes that exchange data using IEEE 802.15.4 low-power links. From the energy and networking requirements viewpoint, the coverage of large and remote agricultural areas with small data acquisition devices that need to harvest energy to run (Morais et al., 2008b) requires the combination of several levels of internetworking for optimum networking performance and scalability. To achieve this, data aggregation and data integration should be accomplished in the field, close to the sensor network. The resulting intermediate layer of aggregation nodes would manage the sensor network, performing local data integration and supervision. Multiple management zones could be easily identified and managed. The advantages of an intermediate layer between the data acquisition layer and the upper level processing and decision support systems, which many authors regard as middleware (Yu et al., 2003; Heinzelman et al., 2004; Curino et al., 2005; Hadim and Mohamed, 2006), become clear. However, the need to render, process and interpret the data that arises from intensive field data acquisition (Kitchen, 2007) makes efficient system integration a critical goal. 2.3 In-field data processing and services The heterogeneity of the sensor nodes or data acquisition devices poses a challenge that needs to be addressed in order to give a satisfactory solution to the PV problem. The heterogeneity makes the extraction and aggregation problems more difficult and broadens the gap between the acquisition of the data and their availability at the processing layer. On the other hand, some authors (Govindan et al., 2002; Hu and Kumar, 2006; Choochaisri and Intanagonwiwat, 2008) have considered sensor networks as a distributed database, which suggests the creation of query mechanisms for accessing summarised information related to the managed area, as well as lists of sensors and sensor attributes (Johannes et al., 2001). The deployment of in-field gateways and the associated intermediate layer would help to meet the networking and scalability demands, allow data aggregation and integration where it makes more sense – in the field, in the vicinity of the sensor network – and would ease the implementation of in-field data processing and services. In-field gateways may act as service providers to local users through the use of common wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth (Garg, 2007) or IEEE 802.11 (Fukatsu and Hirafuji, 2005). Site-specific management tools can then access all gateway data by using a smartphone after an authentication process. Examples of such applications are described by Cunha et al. (2010), who use visual tags to automatically associate a field location to its relevant database tables or records, and to access contextual information or services, useful in PV practices. Fang and He (2008) also emphasise the importance of in-field data processing and management infrastructures. They describe a field information collection, control and management system targeted at PA practices and which is expected to serve as a foundation for the development of field data collection equipment. Our goal when designing the iPAGAT was to meet the multiple requirements discussed throughout this section. The gateway, described in the next section, allows hierarchical networking and remote management, but it also provides Internet access and supports in situ interactions and site-specific management tools. 3 Materials and methods In this section we describe the implementation of iPAGAT, an intelligent and autonomous gateway for in-field processing that we regard as a crucial element of our PV system. We describe first its relation with the rest of our PV system, then its overall architecture, and finally the hardware and software implementation details. 3.1 Background and overview of the system The iPAGAT gateway is part of a long-term effort to establish PV in the hillside vineyards of the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) in Northeast Portugal. The soil of the region is mainly based on complex schist, which makes the assessment of the hydrological status difficult. The vineyards have unique characteristics. The topographic aspects, erosion control, vertical planting, limited water availability, and wide temperature span across all day and year dictate the use of distributed field monitoring and information processing for both operation and performance assessment, in the context of zonal vineyard management. Fig. 1 illustrates the scenario and identifies all the relevant management levels. The bottom layer (L1) embraces all data gathering procedures and relies on WSN technology to collect environmental data within vineyards grouped as a management zone. Layer 2 (L2) devices coordinate the WSN and perform local processing tasks, such as data aggregation. They can also act as an in-field local access point (AP) to site-specific management applications. L2 entities, as gateways to the managed zones, are connected to a Layer 3 (L3) entity which is responsible for farm management in a whole-farm basis concept. Higher layers (L4 and L5) are related to farmer associations and country policies and will not be discussed in this article. In this scenario, three levels of communication networking can coexist: WSN links between gateways and sensor nodes (L2↔L1 connections), Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.11 links between gateways and local user mobile devices (L2↔smartphone connections), and long-range GSM/GPRS and/or IEEE 802.11 links between gateways and the farm management level (L2↔L3 connections). The small stationary data acquisition devices denoted by MPWiNodeZ (Morais et al., 2008a) are an important component of the scenario illustrated in Fig. 1. They are deployed across a specified management zone following a mesh network topology, according to the ZigBee standard. This network has its coordinator operating at the gateway infrastructure of the managed area. Besides WSN management, the network coordinator also operates as a sink node for the gathered data, filling up the gateway database, where data aggregation is performed. The gateway (L2 layer) is also responsible for making data available locally and/or to upper layers, through the use of web-services. Having provided the necessary background information, we may now describe the gateway architecture in detail. 3.2 Gateway architecture The gateway architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2 (system) and Fig. 3 (software). This section gives only a high-level, block-oriented overview of the system. Details about each block will be given in the following sections. The iPAGAT gateway is powered by means of a solar panel combined with a rechargeable battery, under the control of a voltage supervision system. The inter-network connection capabilities of iPAGAT gateway are shown in Fig. 2: Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies are needed to allow authenticated smartphones to access information in the field. In addition to this range of connectivity solutions, the iPAGAT also supports real-time video streaming captured by a 2-axis positioned web camera, useful for image-based applications, such as remote surveillance. As shown in Fig. 3, the software architecture of iPAGAT is built around a relational database management system (RDBM), which provides the main repository for the data gathered from the WSN as well as for the WSN operating rules, and three Java applications: the WSN manager, the Aggregation Engine and a Real-Time Alert System, RTAS. The WSN manager links the WSN, which produces the data, to the RDBM, where the data are stored or aggregated. It performs a number of auxiliary tasks, including network creation, management, and device configuration. Its main task, however, is to collect the data produced by the WSN acquisition devices and signal to the RTAS whenever new data have become available. WSN are notorious producers of massive amounts of heterogeneous information. The data aggregation engine takes the data produced by the WSN and summarises them by aggregation. It periodically goes over the data and updates their mean, maximum and minimum values, storing the updated results back in the data base. The RTAS reacts to both real-time sensor readings stored in the data base and the data produced by the aggregation engine. Its purpose is to check if the sensor readings are within certain (programmable) limits. If the limits are exceeded, the RTAS sends an alert to a remote user using a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) request. As discussed elsewhere, this can be used to detect combinations of climacteric factors that favour the occurrence of diseases or plagues, and trigger alarms if and when they are detected. 3.3 Hardware description The iPAGAT infrastructure is preferably a fixed structure comprising a single-board computer (SBC), a IEEE 802.15.4 WSN coordinator, a long range IP-based GSM/GPRS modem and a IEEE 802.11 AP (Access Point), all powered by a rechargeable battery, which is charged using a solar-panel. As we have seen in Fig. 2 iPAGAT supports Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies, as well as real-time video streaming captured by a 2-axis positioned web camera, useful for applications such as remote surveillance. It also has to meet the computational processing needs required by local aggregation and data integration tasks. To comply with these demands, the iPAGAT was built around the SBC Zeus (Eurotech Ltd., UK). This device, illustrated in Fig. 4 , is an ultra low power EPIC (Embedded Platform for Industrial Computing, 165mm×115mm) single board computer based on Marvell’s 520MHz PXA270 XScale® processor. The PXA270 is an implementation of the ARM compliant Intel XScale microarchitecture combined with a comprehensive set of integrated peripherals including an USB host/client controller, interrupt controller and multiple serial ports. The Zeus includes a site for a variety of wireless modems and is designed to create cost effective solutions in asset monitoring and network solutions. To this effect, Eurotech Ltd. has released a GSM/GPRS, iDEN, CDMA modem, and GPS, using a low profile add-on module. Other features include an onboard DC/DC power supply unit, two Ethernet ports, two USB host ports and seven serial ports, which are used to connect several external devices. Besides its 256MB of SDRAM and 64MB of flash memory, a 8-GB USB memory pen is used as an external disk for the operating system and filesystem. The Zeus runs a Debian Linux Operating System (OS), with power-saving applications in order to enable/disable peripherals, to support all the software needed to the embedded data aggregation and integration systems. To this effect, Zeus becomes a fully functional server with SSH, FTP, web server (Apache 2), MySQL Server, PHP, IPTables, Java and Tomcat support. The energy to power Zeus is harvested from the sun by means of a 40W solar panel (KC40, Kyocera, Japan) combined with a 25Ah rechargeable dryfit battery (A512/25G5, Sonnenschein, Germany) and a voltage regulator (Solsum 6.6C, Steca, Germany). To prevent undervoltage damage, we designed a voltage supervisor sub-system that deactivates the Zeus device when the battery voltage falls below a predefined voltage level, the current trip point being 11.5V. When an undervoltage condition is detected, the voltage supervision sub-system issues a command through an available RS232 port, halting the system and causing a soft shutdown. When the battery charge reaches a safe level (terminal voltage of about 13.0V), the supervision sub-system reconnects Zeus power, which makes it boot normally. 3.4 Connectivity support One of the major goals of the iPAGAT infrastructure was to provide an intermediate, in-field level of inter-networking through any available wireless standard. To this effect, three categories of wireless communications are provided. First, a standard wireless protocol to support L1 layer data gathering functions, as the ones provided by any compliant WSN. Second, a layer provided by a local wireless network, created through the use of standard wireless protocol, that may be used to establish a connection with a smartphone. Finally, a third layer that uses a long-range IP-based protocol to provide Internet and Intranet connections to iPAGAT. In order to support a WSN that builds upon IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee standard, such as those presented in Morais et al., 2008a, an IEEE 802.15.4 network coordinator is required. The physical implementation of the IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee WSN coordinator was accomplished by using an USB Dongle (IA OEM-DAUB1 2400, Integration, UK). This IEEE 802.15.4 interface can be quickly and easily connected to the Zeus through the USB 1.1 interface and provides a simple method of integrating IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee into L2 gateways. The dongle is available with a choice of two driver options: the IEEE 802.15.4 drivers provide direct access to the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC interface and the ZigBee drivers allow the dongle to operate within a ZigBee network and expose the AF/ZDO Application Interfaces. With such functionality, the development of an effective WSN manager becomes straightforward. Smartphones of authenticated users can access the iPAGAT system through a WPAN created with Bluetooth technology or/and by means of a WLAN using IEEE 802.11 technology. To this effect, the iPAGAT is equipped with a Bluetooth dongle (CBT200U2A, Conceptronic, The Netherlands). This provides a simple interface to access field information, to configure iPAGAT settings and to perform other data management operations. iPAGAT also makes available a WLAN using an IEEE 802.11 AP (Open-Mesh, Wireless Mesh Router, OMIP Model), connected to Zeus through an Ethernet cable. To accomplish the goal of providing communications support between iPAGAT and the higher management level (farm management level, L3 in Fig. 1), each iPAGAT is equipped with an add-on GSM/GPRS wireless modem board and an AP, with mesh network support, enabling an ubiquitous networking environment. With this AP, each iPAGAT can operate in bridge/repeater, access point and client modes, and act as a data relay point. 3.5 Software architecture The block-level view of the software architecture of iPAGAT has already been briefly described, based on Fig. 3. The figure shows that iPAGAT has several communication interfaces, accessible through a web-based interface. These are needed to exchange data with local handheld devices and remote L3 farm management applications, which includes a global data warehouse. The iPAGAT gateway uses an external WSN manager to coordinate a IEEE 802.15.4 compliant network, composed by multichannel acquisition devices that are deployed across a management zone. We will now discuss the main software blocks of iPAGAT in some more detail. These are the RDBM and three Java applications: the WSN manager, the Aggregation Engine and a Real-Time Alert System, RTAS. 3.5.1 The relational database management system The RDBM is the main data repository of iPAGAT and is built around a MySQL RDBM. Fig. 5 depicts the relational diagram of the RDBM, composed by 10 tables. The main table is called zeusdb.nodes and it has an entry for each acquisition device in the network. The primary key of this table provides the most convenient way of referring to any specific network device. Each device is also classified according to a user-specific management zone. This is accomplished by using the table zeusdb.zone, in which the field Coordinates stores a relevant location within the zone. Since each acquisition device may have more than one sensor, the database has the additional table zeusdb.nodesensors which stores the information about each sensor. Rules of operation are described through table zeusdb.rules, which contains trip point values that are used by the RTAS. Microclimacteric data, acquired by any compliant IEEE 802.15.4 network device, is gathered by the WSN manager and stored in the table zeusdb.sensordata for a 7-day period in a FIFO basis. The fields Node and Channel identify and classify each data source by utilisation purpose and by management zone. Summarised information (aggregation data) regarding all sensor data is produced by the Java aggregation engine, which runs periodically and fills up the table zeusdb.aggdata. The content can then be uploaded to a global data warehouse, through queries over the data integration interface. A third Java application, the core of the alert system, inspects the tables, compares their data with threshold values, and depending on the circumstances produces an alarm or a generic event. These applications are described hereafter. 3.5.2 WSN manager and WSN engine The WSN manager is a Java application running on iPAGAT that basically controls an external IEEE 802.15.4 network coordinator (WSN engine) through a UART physical connection. Besides network creation and management operations, the WSN manager is responsible for data operations over the deployed WSN, such as device configuration and sensor data exchange. When new data reaches the WSN engine, as a result of an individual measurement taken on an acquisition device, it is converted to engineering units using the parametrisation defined in zeusdb.units and zeusdb.sensortype tables and the result is stored as a new entry in the zeusdb.sensordata table. Each entry in this table is composed of the source identification, network node identification, acquisition channel related to each node, measurement data and associated time stamp, enabling full characterisation of each data sample. After data insertion in zeusdb.sensordata, the RTAS is signalled (through an internal data socket) with the new data available. 3.5.3 The data aggregation engine As mentioned before, each WSN acquisition device can be regarded as an independent data source that generates records with several fields. When considering a routing protocol to communicate with nodes that are spatially distant, such as the standard IEEE 802.15.4 (IEEE, 2006), or in the case of nodes with limited computation, energy and storage capabilities, several issues arise, such as network traffic overload. WSN may generate a huge amount of data coming from a multitude of heterogeneous data sources. The traffic is usually centralised or forwarded to the sink node. These large data sets cannot be transmitted regularly and efficiently to higher-level processing stages without being aggregated. Aggregation may also be useful to increase the range of knowledge, level of accuracy and to create data redundancy to compensate for software or hardware failures in WSN nodes (Ibrahim et al., 2005; Akkaya et al., 2008; Tubaishat et al., 2003). Under this point of view, every sensor reading that reaches the WSN manager is aggregated to compute a summarised result available through the web-based integration system. According to Akkaya et al. (2008), data aggregation is the process of combining multiple data packets into one by looking at their contents. In iPAGAT, the data aggregation engine is a Java application that makes periodic data iterations, with period determined by the field zeusdb.AggDataCycleTime of the zeusdb.config table. The first task executed by this application is to build the query for getting the data of the whole day for each channel of an acquisition device. It then executes the query and saves the result. Next, it calculates the mean, the maximum and the minimum values and executes an UPDATE statement with the calculated values and the last set of values. If there is no entry to update, it executes an INSERT statement. At the end of each aggregation cycle, the aggregation engine signals the RTAS with new data (from zeusdb.aggdata tables). 3.5.4 Real-time alert system The RTAS is a Java application that, as seen in Fig. 3, runs on top of the RDBM system and reacts to the real-time sensor readings and the summarised information that results from the data aggregation process. It illustrates the benefits of local processing and decision. It has a socket-based interface with both the WSN manager and aggregation engine and a SOAP web services based approach. SOAP provides a uniform and reliable mechanism for data exchange over TCP/IP links, and eases the interaction with mobile devices (such as smartphones or cellphones) and the connection with remote management applications. The purpose of the RTAS engine is to check the data from both the WSN manager and the aggregation engine to verify if sensor readings stored in the tables zeusdb.aggdata and zeusdb.sensordata are within the limits defined by the fields min_value and max_value of the table zeusdb.rules. If the limits are exceeded, the RTAS sends an automatic alert to a remote user using a SOAP request. Functional flowchart is depicted in Fig. 6 . The alerting system can also be used to signal the existence of conditions favourable to the occurrence of diseases or plagues based on the combination of certain climacteric factors. For example, if the soil moisture in a certain region reaches values below a minimum defined value, an automatic alert is issued in order to turn-on an irrigation valve. 1 illustrates the conceptual definition of a RTAS rule while 2 gives an example. 3.5.5 The data integration interface All the mentioned software components have been built with the goal of collecting and aggregating data from heterogeneous data sources such as those provided by WSN. The data integration system is at the interface with the iPAGAT and it basically bridges two different realities: one responsible for collecting and making data available, and another that makes intensive use of such data without the need to know how it is generated, processed and returned. The data integration system was designed with the goal of providing a high-level access to sensor data stored in a in-field WSN gateway. The implementation of iPAGAT data integration system interface follows a WS approach, and provides the necessary query mechanism for retrieving gateway data. To improve query processing efficiency, there are basically two types of queries corresponding to the two types of data and tables: raw data and aggregated data. The first query type is related to the raw data that is available in each gateway RDBM system and follows the on-demand approach (i.e., extracting data from the zeusdb.sensordata table only when the query is posed). This query enables the retrieval of individual sensor data. It is buffered in a 7-days time period window before being discarded. The command center or any authenticated user can use this mechanism whenever needed. The second type of query is related to the gateway summarised information, stored in the iPAGAT zeusdb.aggdata table. The result of each aggregated engine cycle is stored in the appropriate table for a 7-day time period window. Raw data and aggregated data tables are continuously updated by the RDBM system by inserting new data and discarding old one. While raw data is permanently discarded, summarised information can be transferred to a data warehouse by issuing an appropriate query. Summarised data older than this 7-day period must be requested directly to the data warehouse. By using this approach, global query processing is optimised, gateway query processing is made more efficient and data exchange between iPAGAT and the data warehouse can be relegated to periods of low network activity. The web-based data integration interface defines a set of WS containing all operations that are needed to handle gateway data. As an example, the operation getSensorData_by is shown in 3 . As observed, the user provides high-level parameters as Zone, Utilisation, SensorType, etc., in order to get/retrieve data, instead of using low-level ones such as NodeID, Channel, etc. 4 Experiments and results An experiment was conducted on vineyards at the UTAD Agricultural Research Centre, Vila Real, Portugal, starting in the Spring of 2008, with three main objectives: (1) the study of hi-power ZigBee wireless devices and their impact on the well established MPWiNodeZ data acquisition platform (Morais et al., 2008b); (2) the evaluation of iPAGAT hardware and power management techniques, based on a solar panel/dry fit battery set-up; (3) the evaluation of the built-in data aggregation engine and the data integration interface, as key blocks of the gateway software architecture. For this purpose, the iPAGAT hardware structure was mounted in the roof of our Engineering Laboratory building in order to establish wireless links to MPWiNodeZ devices deployed according to the map in Fig. 7 . Two of them (referred to as Malv01 and Malv02 in Fig. 7) have been used since the start of this experiment in real-time monitoring. They collect micrometeorological parameters in a vineyard (air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation), to assist in mildew powdery disease modelling. Device P3 is used to route Malv01 and Malv02 data back to the iPAGAT. The other four devices (P4, P5, P6 and P7) were installed in more remote locations, in order to evaluate ZigBee Jennic hi-power (+20dBm) modules (JN5148-001-M04, Jennic, UK) as routing elements of a generic ad hoc network based on the MPWiNodeZ platform. In this case, the battery voltage discharging profiles and the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) were recorded by each MPWinodeZ device and routed back to the network coordinator – a part of the iPAGAT system – for storage and post-processing. Network layout, node distances and LQI values are presented in Fig. 7. 4.1 iPAGAT DC current consumption The iPAGAT is powered by a 40W solar panel and a 25Ah capacity battery. With all devices but the Bluetooth dongle turned on, iPAGAT consumes an electrical DC current of approximately 300mA over 12.6V, which gives an overall power consumption of 3.78W. Fig. 8 shows the battery charging/discharging profile as well as the DC current consumption for a 10-day period. iPAGAT housing internal temperature (onboard temperature sensor) is also shown. The Bluetooth discovery service is turned as well as the GPRS modem and the IEEE 802.11 interface. 4.2 iPAGAT data gadget iPAGAT data can be accessed through its data integration system interface by posing specific queries. Fig. 9 shows a Windows gadget feature used to demonstrate how easily data can be remotely retrieved and visualised directly on a Windows desktop. In the example, the aggregated data summarise relative humidity, air temperature and solar radiation acquired by the Malv02 node. 4.3 RTAS in disease prediction To illustrate the advantages of the RTAS embedded in the iPAGAT we developed a simple disease probability monitoring system, depicted in Fig. 10 . At the end of each aggregation cycle, each uploaded rule is checked against the aggregated data. The example is based on a mildew disease prediction model Cruz (1982). If the precipitation has been above 10mm, the zone temperature has been within 10°C and 11°C, the relative humidity has remained above 80%, and the rule has been consistently triggered throughout a certain number of days, a warning is generated. 5 Conclusions and discussion The deployment of a wireless sensor network and its use in the PV context is not straightforward. The acquisition of the raw data is left to a number of typically small, low-power, energy-harvesting devices but decision support systems depend on higher-level data representations. There is a gap between what the low-level devices provide and what the higher levels need. This difficulty can be overcome at a cost (computing power and bandwidth) but as the number of sensors increases, the volume of the raw data and the resources needed become prohibitive. The iPAGAT gateway was designed to bridge the gap between the sensors and the decision-making. It circumvents the difficulties created by a centralised processing model by providing an intermediate layer between the sensor network and a remote location. The iPAGAT is deployed in the field and as such it must be autonomous. Our field tests confirm that its power needs can in general be met by harvesting solar energy. The iPAGAT is therefore capable of continuous operation and is fully compatible with the sensor devices used. The testing also showed that several consecutive cloudy days may cause a power failure. We verified that the replacement of the original 25Ah dry-fit battery with one of higher capacity (A512/55A, Sonnenschein, Germany) considerably reduces the probability of a failure. The iPAGAT increases the overall intelligence of the sensor network. It runs an aggregation engine and performs intermediate level data processing. By doing so, it distributes the work load. The test results shows that the software architecture and database structure are adequate and that the system performs well even under intensive use. The communication capabilities of the iPAGAT, which include Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and GPRS, have also proven very useful. They allow local and remote users to access the Internet, but, more importantly, they make it possible for users located in the field to access gateway and remote data, using authenticated smartphones. This flexibility opens up the way for further developments and applications, some of which we have already begin to discuss (Cunha et al., 2010). Our field experiments and tests provide convincing evidence that iPAGAT represents an important step forward in the development of distributed service-oriented information systems for precision agriculture applications.

        "doc_abstract": "Random binary matrices have found many applications in signal processing and coding. Rateless codes, for example, are based on the random generation of codewords by means of inner products between the data and random binary vectors. But the usefulness of random binary matrices is not limited to coding: they are also well suited to distributed data storage applications. In this context, random binary matrices with block-angular structure are of particular interest because they allow cooperative encoding and decentralized models for coding and decoding, with a built-in degree of parallelism. Linear programming, LUfactorization andQRfactorization are some of the problems for which the coarse-grain parallelization inherent in the block-angular structure is of interest. This paper studies one of the most important characteristics of block-angular matrices, their rank. More precisely, we study the rank distribution and full rank probability of rectangular random binary matrices and block-angular matrices in GF(2). © 2011 IEEE.",

        "doc_abstract": "A finite-context (Markov) model of order k yields the probability distribution of the next symbol in a sequence of symbols, given the recent past up to depth k. Markov modeling has long been applied to DNA sequences, for example to find gene-coding regions. With the first studies came the discovery that DNA sequences are non-stationary: distinct regions require distinct model orders. Since then, Markov and hidden Markov models have been extensively used to describe the gene structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive study about the potential of Markov models to describe complete genomes is still lacking. We address this gap in this paper. Our approach relies on (i) multiple competing Markov models of different orders (ii) careful programming techniques that allow orders as large as sixteen (iii) adequate inverted repeat handling (iv) probability estimates suited to the wide range of context depths used. To measure how well a model fits the data at a particular position in the sequence we use the negative logarithm of the probability estimate at that position. The measure yields information profiles of the sequence, which are of independent interest. The average over the entire sequence, which amounts to the average number of bits per base needed to describe the sequence, is used as a global performance measure. Our main conclusion is that, from the probabilistic or information theoretic point of view and according to this performance measure, multiple competing Markov models explain entire genomes almost as well or even better than state-of-the-art DNA compression methods, such as XM, which rely on very different statistical models. This is surprising, because Markov models are local (short-range), contrasting with the statistical models underlying other methods, where the extensive data repetitions in DNA sequences is explored, and therefore have a non-local character. © 2011 Pinho et al.",

        "doc_abstract": "This paper is concerned with the two summation formulae of Euler-Maclaurin (EMSF) and Abel-Plana (APSF) of numerical analysis, that of Poisson (PSF) of Fourier analysis, and the approximate sampling formula (ASF) of signal analysis. It is shown that these four fundamental propositions are all equivalent, in the sense that each is a corollary of any of the others. For this purpose ten of the twelve possible implications are established. Four of these, namely the implications of the grouping APSF ← ASF → EMSF ↔ PSF are shown here for the first time. The proofs of the others, which are already known and were established by three of the above authors, have been adapted to the present setting. In this unified exposition the use of powerful methods of proof has been avoided as far as possible, in order that the implications may stand in a clear light and not be overwhelmed by external factors. Finally, the four propositions of this paper are brought into connection with four propositions of mathematical analysis for bandlimited functions, including the Whittaker-Kotel'nikov-Shannon sampling theorem. In conclusion, all eight propositions are equivalent to another. Finally, the first three summation formulae are interpreted as quadrature formulae. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.",

        "doc_abstract": "DNA may be represented by sequences of four symbols, but it is often useful to convert those symbols into real or complex numbers for further analysis. Several mapping schemes have been used in the past, but most of them seem to be unrelated to any intrinsic characteristic of DNA. The objective of this work was to study a mapping scheme that is directly related to DNA characteristics, and that could be useful in discriminating between different species.Recently, we have proposed a methodology based on the inter-nucleotide distance, which proved to contribute to the discrimination among species. In this paper, we introduce a new distance, the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide, which is the distance of a nucleotide to first occurrence of a different nucleotide. This distance is related to the repetition structure of single nucleotides. Using the information resulting from the concatenation of the distance to the nearest dissimilar and the inter-nucleotide distance, we found that this new distance brings additional discriminative capabilities. This suggests that the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide might contribute with useful information about the evolution of the species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

DNA may be represented by sequences of four symbols, but it is often useful to convert those symbols into real or complex numbers for further analysis. Several mapping schemes have been used in the past, but most of them seem to be unrelated to any intrinsic characteristic of DNA. The objective of this work was to study a mapping scheme that is directly related to DNA characteristics, and that could be useful in discriminating between different species. Recently, we have proposed a methodology based on the inter-nucleotide distance, which proved to contribute to the discrimination among species. In this paper, we introduce a new distance, the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide, which is the distance of a nucleotide to first occurrence of a different nucleotide. This distance is related to the repetition structure of single nucleotides. Using the information resulting from the concatenation of the distance to the nearest dissimilar and the inter-nucleotide distance, we found that this new distance brings additional discriminative capabilities. This suggests that the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide might contribute with useful information about the evolution of the species. Keywords Alignment-free genome comparison Inter-nucleotide distances Nearest dissimilar distances DNA sequences 1 Introduction DNA sequences have been converted to numerical signals using different mappings. A commonly used mapping is to consider binary sequences that describe the position of each symbol (Voss, 1992). The binary representation is certainly one of the earliest and one of the most popular mappings of DNA. However, several other different mappings have been proposed (see for example Silverman and Linsker, 1986; Jeffrey, 1990; Zhang and Zhang, 1994; Buldyrev et al., 1995; Anastassiou, 2001; Cristea, 2003; Ning et al., 2003; Brodzik and Peters, 2005; Liao et al., 2005; Akhtar et al., 2007; Randic, 2008; Nair and Mahalakshmi, 2005; Afreixo et al., 2009). Some of the mappings used in DNA processing do not have a simple numerical interpretation and others do not have biological motivation. Also, some of the representations are not reversible and do not take into account the sequence structure. Currently, there is no ideal mapping to analyze every type of correlation in DNA sequences. In a previous work, we explored the inter-nucleotide (IN) distance, the distance to the first occurrence of the same symbol, to perform a comparative analysis between species (Afreixo et al., 2009). In this work, we present a new DNA numerical profile and a new mapping to explore the correlation structure of DNA: the distance to the nearest dissimilar (ND) nucleotide. This representation converts any DNA sequence into a unique numerical sequence with lower length, where each number represents the distance of a symbol to the next occurrence of a different symbol. We introduced also four sequences, one for each nucleotide, to represent the ND distances. This allows to perform comparative analysis between the behavior of the four nucleotides distance sequences and the global sequence. From the perspective of molecular evolution, DNA sequences may reflect both the results of random mutation and selective evolution. One should subtract the random background from the simple counting result in order to highlight the contribution of selective evolution (Qi et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2010). Therefore, we present an analysis of the relative error to highlight the contribution of selective evolution of the DNA of each species. This residual analysis may be used, for example, to perform multiple organism comparisons. Phylogenetic trees reproduce the evolutionary tree that represents the historical relationships between the species. Recent phylogenetic tree algorithms use nucleotide sequences. Typically, these trees are constructed with multiple sequence alignment (Hodge and Cope, 2000), which is a computationally demanding task. Recently, alignment-free methods have been proposed and present some advantages over multiple sequences alignment methods (see for example Sims et al., 2009; Vinga and Almeida, 2003). The distance that we address in this paper seems to possess discriminating properties that might be helpful in inferring phylogenies. We do believe that this claim is supported by the examples of trees that are provided. However, we also believe that, by itself, this distance measure does not convey all necessary information for building phylogenies. Instead, it should be regarded as potentially useful for working in cooperation and complementing other measures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 DNA sequences In this study, we used the complete DNA sequences of 29 species: 27 were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Populus trichocarpa (California poplar) obtained from the Joint Genome Institute and Xenopus tropicalis (Western clawed frog) from Xenbase The species used in this work are listed in Table 1 . 2.2 Distance to the nearest dissimilar Consider the alphabet A = { A , C , G , T } and let s = ( s k ) k ∈ { 1 , … , N } be a symbolic sequence defined in A . Consider a numerical sequence, w x , that represents the distance to the nearest dissimilar of symbol x ∈ A . As an example, the four ND distance sequences for the short DNA fragment CAAACCGTTTAAGTAACAGGGATATTGGCCC are w A = ( 3 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) , w C = ( 1 , 2 , 1 , 3 ) , w G = ( 1 , 1 , 3 , 2 ) , w T = ( 3 , 1 , 1 , 2 ) . The global sequence of ND distances for this example is w = ( 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 ) . Note that the ND distance of each nucleotide corresponds to the repeat length of that nucleotide. Algorithm 1 Computation of w for sequence s. p ≔ 1 p ′ ≔ 1 while p ′ ≤ N do i ≔ 0 while s p ′ = s p ′ + i do i ≔ i + 1 end while w p ≔ i p ≔ p + 1 p ′ ≔ p ′ + i end while Algorithm 2 Computation of w x with x ∈ A . p ≔ 1 p ′ ≔ 1 while p ′ ≤ N do i ≔ 0 while s p ′ + i = ′ x ′ do i ≔ i + 1 end while if i=0 then p ′ ≔ p ′ + 1 else w p ≔ i p ≔ p + 1 p ′ ≔ p ′ + i end if end while Note that (1) ∑ i = 1 L w i = N , where L is the length of w. Let n i be the number of occurrences of ND distance i, then (2) ∑ i = 1 K n i i = N , where K is the largest ND distance present in the data sequence. The mean distance is (3) ∑ i = 1 L w i L = N L . 2.2.1 Relationship between ND and IN distances In general, the ND distance distribution complements the information that is accumulated in the first IN distance. We recall that the IN distance is the distance to the first occurrence of the same nucleotide. Let n ′ i be the absolute frequency of the ith IN distance, (4) n ′ 1 = ∑ i = 2 K n i ( i − 1 ) + δ = N − L + δ and (5) ∑ i = 2 K ′ n ′ i = ∑ i = 1 K n i − δ = L − δ , where δ = 0 , s 1 ≠ s N , 1 , s 1 = s N , and K ′ is the largest IN distance present in the data sequence. The last equation can be described by the following sentence: the number of IN distances greater than one is equal to the total number of ND distances. As an illustration, the computed values for the previous DNA fragment example are N=31, n ′ 1 = 14 , L=18, δ = 1 . 2.2.2 Comparison with an independent random process In order to calculate some statistical properties of various genomes, we will study the characteristics of the ND distance distribution. Consider p A , p C , p G and p T the occurrence probabilities of nucleotides A, C, G and T, respectively. If the nucleotide sequences were generated by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random process, then each of the distances, W x , would follow a geometric distribution of parameter 1−p x . In fact, the probability distribution of the distance to the nearest dissimilar for symbol x is (6) f x ( k ) = P ( W x = k ) = P ( W = k | x ) = ( 1 − p x ) ( p x ) k − 1 , k = 1 , 2 , … Fig. 1 shows the measured and the reference distributions of the ND distance sequences for the Homo sapiens complete genome. Although the ND distance distribution from DNA shows an exponential behavior, it differs from the reference distribution. This is expected, since the reference distribution was established under the assumption of an i.i.d. random process (with constant nucleotide relative frequencies estimated from the DNA sequence). We performed the chi-square goodness of fit test with the result that the distributions are significantly different (all p values < 10 − 4 ). In order to measure the differences between the observed and the reference distributions we used the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Assuming that the DNA sequence was generated by an independent random process with constant parameters, the corresponding global ND distance sequence distribution is given by (7) f ( k ) = P ( W = k ) = ∑ x ∈ A P ( W = k | x ) P ( x ) = ∑ x ∈ A ( 1 − p x ) ( p x ) k . 2.3 Numerical procedure The histograms of the ND distance sequences were computed for each nucleotide and also for the global sequence. For large genomes and for convenience, the sequences were divided into blocks of 500000 symbols. This procedure does not influence the total nucleotide counts. For eukaryote genomes, the chromosomes were processed separately and the resulting distance histograms were stored separately. All the symbols in the sequence that did not correspond to one of the four nucleotides were removed from the sequences before further processing. We setup to investigate how similar (or different) are the observed and the reference distributions of: • the four nucleotides of Homo sapiens; • the chromosomes of Homo sapiens; • various species. In order to facilitate the visual comparison of the various distance distributions with the theoretical one and to subtract the random background, we used the relative error, as given by (8) r ( k ) = f o ( k ) − f ( k ) f o ( k ) , where f o ( k ) is the observed relative frequency of the distance k and f(k) is the relative frequency of the reference distribution. For the prokaryote species the values of the relative error of the ND distance were truncated to values between −1 and 1. We also used the IN distance relative error used in Afreixo et al. (2009) and we concatenated the first 100 IN distances and the first 20 ND distance relative errors. Only the first 20 ND distances were used, because for larger distances the distributions become sparse. We have found that the limitation to the first 20 distances, which was carried out in all numerical experiments described in this paper, provides an adequate compromise between the information content and the vector length. Note that 792 is the largest ND distance for all the studied species and that the maximum proportion of the ND distances above 20 is 0.13%. 3 Results 3.1 Distances analysis We compared the observed ND distance distributions of all Homo sapiens chromosomes and we obtained very small Kullback–Leibler divergence ( < 0.0008 ). We have also compared, using the Kullback–Leibler divergence, the ND distance distribution of the four nucleotides of the Homo sapiens complete genome. The results of the comparative tests are shown in Table 2 , showing that the ND distance distribution of nucleotide A is closer to that of nucleotide T than to the other two nucleotides, and the ND distance distribution of C is closer to that of nucleotide G than to the other two nucleotides. Notice that the DNA complementary sequence was not used in the computation of the distributions. These identical distance distributions for the nucleotides A/T and C/G are present in all the human chromosomes and also in the genome of all the other species used in this work. This may be explained by the Chargaff's second parity rule and the extension of this rule (see for example Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Albrecht-Buehler, 2006, 2007). We used the relative error, as defined in (8), to compare the ND distance distributions, both for nucleotides and global sequences, with the reference distributions. This corresponds to removing the contribution of the random background to the ND distance distribution (Qi et al., 2004). Fig. 2 shows the relative error for the ND distance for each nucleotide of the Homo sapiens genome and Fig. 3 the relative error for the global ND distance sequence. A relative error close to zero means that the observed frequency is similar to that of the reference distribution. Values close to one imply observed distances much more frequent than in the reference distribution. For the global ND distance (Fig. 3) of the human genome, the first two distances have a lower frequency than the one corresponding to random sequences, whereas the other distances have higher frequencies. The relative frequencies of distances above two are higher than in the reference distribution. The repetition of three or more nucleotides is more frequent in the human genome than in a random sequence. This pervasive existence of repeats is a well known characteristic of the human genome. 3.2 Analysis of multiple organisms The ND distance relative error vectors of each complete genome may be used as a genomic signature that identifies each species, thus allowing the comparison of species (e.g. by building phylogenetic trees). We used the UPGMA programs in the PHYLIP package to build the phylogenetic trees (the similarity matrix was computed using the Euclidean distance). The comparison of the various phylogenetic trees was carried out with TOPD/FMTS software (Puigbo et al., 2007) and using the split distance (a low split distance value is synonymous of a high number of common branches between the two trees). Hierarchical clustering was applied to a matrix composed by the first 20 ND distances for all the species used in this study. Fig. 4 shows the phylogenetic tree for all the species in this study. The phylogenetic tree (obtained with complete linkage) displays a first branching between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, showing most of the mammals together. Moreover, all vertebrates are in the same cluster, the only two non-vertebrates in that cluster are A. mellifera and V. vinifera. Fungi are also grouped together. The bacteria are displayed close together and the archaeota further apart. With the ND distance relative errors we obtained an interesting tree that shows some of the evolutive features. However, we could point several unexpected clusters which may be due to the use of small vectors (20 elements) to characterize the species. In parallel, we have developed methodologies based on the IN distances that can be complemented with information from the ND distances. These two methodologies are complementary: both describe distances between nucleotides, but in two different ways (see Section 2.2.1). Fig. 5 shows the phylogenetic tree constructed with a species vector that corresponds to the concatenation of the IN (removing the first IN distance) and ND relative errors. We compare the results obtained by the IN–ND concatenation method with the IN, ND and random methods in Table 3 . The concatenation method obtains a tree topology similar to the IN method, but the changes introduced produced a better phylogenetic tree, including a higher fungi and archaeota differentiation. The differences between Figs. 4 and 5 may arise from the use of larger vectors in Fig. 5 (119 elements), thus conveying more information than the ND distance vectors (Fig. 4). Moreover, as already mentioned, the ND distance complements the information accumulated in the first IN distance. In order to compare alignment and alignment-free algorithms to construct phylogenetic trees (Sims et al., 2009) used 10 mammals. Fig. 6 shows the phylogenetic tree constructed for the same set of mammals as used by Sims et al. (2009), using the IN–ND concatenation method. The topology of the phylogenetic tree obtained using the IN–ND concatenation method is similar to the phylogenetic trees presented by Sims et al. (2009) for alignment based algorithms (Type I, Type II, Prasad Arjun et al., 2008). Fig. 7 shows the normalized split distance between alignment algorithms and alignment-free algorithms (Sims's methods and our methods). The normalized split distance is the number of splits in one tree, but not present in the other, divided by the total number of splits in the tree. The IN–ND concatenation method shows a small split distance value (similar to those obtained by Sims et al., 2009) which reveals that the IN–ND concatenation contains relevant information about the phylogenetic evolution. 4 Conclusion The ND distance mapping contains information about nucleotide repetition structure in the DNA sequence and characterizes the lengths of the single nucleotide repeats. An interesting feature of the ND distance approach is the strong similarity found for the A/T and C/G nucleotides. This may be explained by the existence of inverted repeats and by the second Chargaff parity rule and its extensions (Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Albrecht-Buehler, 2006, 2007). Since the ND distance vectors are small (around 20 elements) and the IN distance characterizes the distance between groups of single nucleotide repeats, we concatenated the IN and ND distances in order to obtain a vector that better differentiates species. The results obtained in this work suggest that, for the addressed species, there is a genetic signature, a vector with the concatenation of the relative error of the IN and ND distances, that is a distinguishing characteristic of each species.

        "doc_abstract": "The classical sampling theorem has often been attributed to E. T. Whittaker, but this attribution is not strictly valid. One must carefully distinguish, for example, between the concepts of sampling and of interpolation, and we find that Whittaker worked in interpolation theory, not sampling theory. Again, it has been said that K. Ogura was the first to give a properly rigorous proof of the sampling theorem. We find that he only indicated where the method of proof could be found; we identify what is, in all probability, the proof he had in mind. Ogura states his sampling theorem as a \"converse of Whittaker's theorem\", but identifies an error in Whittaker's work. In order to study these matters in detail we find it necessary to make a complete review of the famous 1915 paper of E. T. Whittaker, and two not so well known papers of Ogura dating from 1920. Since the life and work of Ogura is practically unknown outside Japan, and there he is usually regarded only as an educationalist, we present a detailed overview together with a list of some 70 papers of his which we had to compile. K. Ogura is presented in the setting of mathematics in Japan of the early 20th century. Finally, because many engineering textbooks refer to Whittaker as a source for the sampling theorem, we make a very brief review of some early introductions of sampling methods in the engineering context, mentioning H.

Here, we explore different sets of minimal absent words in the genomes of 22 organisms (one archaeota, thirteen bacteria and eight eukaryotes). We investigate if the mutational biases that may explain the deficit of the shortest absent words in vertebrates are also pervasive in other absent words, namely in minimal absent words, as well as to other organisms. We find that the compositional biases observed for the shortest absent words in vertebrates are not uniform throughout different sets of minimal absent words. We further investigate the hypothesis of the inheritance of minimal absent words through common ancestry from the similarity in dinucleotide relative abundances of different sets of minimal absent words, and find that this inheritance may be exclusive to vertebrates. © 2011 Garcia et al.",

The inter-dinucleotide distance is defined as the distance to the next occurrence of the same dinucleotide. We consider the 16 sequences of inter-dinucleotide distances and two reading frames. Our results show a period-3 oscillation in the protein-coding inter-dinucleotide distance distributions that is absent from the whole-genome distributions. We also compare the distance distribution of each dinucleotide to a reference distribution, that of a random sequence generated with the same dinucleotide abundances, revealing the CG dinucleotide as the one with the highest cumulative relative error for the first 60 distances. Moreover, the distance distribution of each dinucleotide is compared to the distance distribution of all other dinucleotides using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We find that the distance distribution of a dinucleotide and that of its reversed complement are very similar, hence, the divergence between them is very small. This is an interesting finding that may give evidence of a stronger parity rule than Chargaff's second parity rule. Copyright 2011 The Author(s). Published by Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics.",

        "doc_abstract": "This article discusses the interplay between multiplex signal transmission in telegraphy and telephony, and sampling methods. It emphasizes the works of Herbert Raabe (1909-2004) and Claude Shannon (1916-2001) and the context in which they occurred. Attention is given to the role that the exceptional research atmosphere in Berlin during the 1920s and early 1930s played in the development of some of the ideas underlying these works, first in Germany and then in the USA, as some of the protagonists moved there. Raabe's thesis, published in 1939, describes and analyses a time-division multiplex system for telephony. In order to build his working prototype, Raabe had to develop the theoretical tools he needed and achieved a thorough understanding of sampling, including sampling with pulses of finite duration and sampling of low-pass and band-pass signals. His condition for reconstruction was known as 'Raabe's condition' in the German literature of the time. On the other hand, Shannon's works of 1948 and 1949 contain the classical sampling theorem, but go much further and lay down the abstract theoretical framework that underlies much of the modern digital communications. It is interesting to compare Raabe's very practical approach with Shannon's abstract work: Raabe independently developed his methods to the degree he needed, but his main purpose was to build a working prototype. Shannon, on the other hand, approached sampling independently of practical constraints, as part of information theory - which became tremendously influential. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

Tel.: +34913363104; fax: +34913363001. New extremal properties of Daubechies 4-tap orthonormal filters are given: they maximize a certain functional, have the largest gain in ( 0 , π / 2 ) , and allow maximum energy compaction in [ 0 , π / 2 ] . These properties do not carry over to Daubechies filters of arbitrary length. They complement what is known about Daubechies filters and highlight the specific role of the 4-tap filter. Moreover, we demonstrate that these properties cannot be fulfilled by any other orthonormal lowpass filter, regardless of its length. Keywords Daubechies filters Energy compaction Extremal properties Filter banks 1 Introduction Filter banks are multichannel and multirate structures useful in several applications and closely related to wavelet decompositions. Extensive background can be found in [1–9]. Two-channel, orthogonal FIR filter banks are perhaps the most often used. They can be characterized in more than one way. In terms of its impulse response h, a filter of even length is orthogonal if and only if h is orthogonal to its even shifts. If the ℓ 2 norm of the impulse response is 1, the filter is called orthonormal (or paraunitary). In terms of z transform H ( z ) = ∑ h n z − n , an orthonormal filter is characterized by the condition | H ( z ) | 2 + | H ( − z ) | 2 = 2 , for all z in the unit circle. In other words, the square of the magnitude of its frequency response, which we will denote by P ( ω ) ≔ | H ( e i ω ) | 2 , satisfies P ( ω ) + P ( π − ω ) = 2 . For lowpass filters, the additional condition P(0)=2 is imposed, as it appears in the literature about filter banks and wavelets [2,4,7,8]. Therefore, any orthonormal lowpass filter must verify P ( π ) = 0 = H ( − 1 ) ; this means that at least one zero at one half the sampling frequency is required. The class of Daubechies filters of length L is well known. They are the unique orthonormal lowpass FIR filters whose frequency responses present maximal flatness at ω = π for the given filter length. In other words, the number of zeros at ω = π is maximum, and equals L/2. To cite some properties, these filters have the maximum number of vanishing moments and lead to compactly supported orthonormal wavelet bases [2]. Here we point out other new properties of these filters: for L=4, the frequency response P of these filters corresponds to the unique solution of an energy maximization problem: it maximizes the energy compaction in [ 0 , π / 2 ] , defined as ∫ 0 π / 2 P . It also exhibits the largest gain P ( e i ω ) at each frequency ω , ω ∈ ( 0 , π / 2 ) , among all other orthonormal lowpass filters of the same length. Naturally, because our results are expressed in terms of the modulus of a frequency response, these properties are shared by the minimum-phase and maximum-phase Daubechies filters. Curiously, for L > 4 , the frequency response of the Daubechies filters is not singled out in the same way over the set of all orthonormal filters: in other words, the filter which renders the corresponding functionals a maximum for is not a Daubechies filter. Moreover, we prove that there is no orthonormal lowpass filter of length L > 4 that exhibits maximum gain among all the filters of length ≤ L . 2 The new properties We adhere to the following notation: h and H ( e i ω ) will denote the impulse and frequency responses of an orthonormal filter. We will often need to refer to the squared modulus of the frequency response of such filters, and so, for brevity, we write P ( ω ) ≔ | H ( e i ω ) | 2 . In particular, P 4 ( ω ) will denote the square of the modulus of the frequency response of the 4-tap Daubechies orthonormal filter. Explicitly, P 4 ( ω ) = 1 + 9 8 cos ω − 1 8 cos 3 ω . Recall that all lowpass filters satisfy P(0)=2, whereas the orthonormality property also implies P ( π / 2 ) = 1 . For the remaining frequencies ω ∈ ( 0 , π / 2 ) we will prove the following results. Theorem 1 The square modulus of the frequency response P ( ω ) of any 4-tap lowpass orthonormal filter other than the Daubechies filter satisfies (1) P ( ω ) < P 4 ( ω ) , ∀ ω ∈ ( 0 , π / 2 ) , where P 4 ( ω ) is the frequency response of the 4-tap Daubechies filter. In other words, among the frequency responses of all orthonormal lowpass filters with 4 taps, there is only one that has the largest possible gain at every frequency in [ 0 , π / 2 ] ; this unique maximal frequency response corresponds to the 4-tap Daubechies filter. Fig. 1 illustrates this: the frequency response of the 4-tap Daubechies filter lies above that of the other orthonormal filters in ( 0 , π / 2 ) . Our second result is the following: Theorem 2 For any function f ( ω ) ≥ 0 in [ 0 , π / 2 ] such that ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) d ω > 0 , and for any orthonormal 4-tap lowpass filter h other than the Daubechies filter, (2) ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) P ( ω ) d ω < ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) P 4 ( ω ) d ω , where, as before, P 4 ( ω ) is the frequency response of the 4-tap Daubechies filter. Theorem 2 states that, for any arbitrary weight function f, the functional ∫ 0 π / 2 fP (defined over the frequency responses P of 4-tap orthonormal lowpass filters) achieves its maximum for P=P 4, regardless the weight function f. Before considering the proofs of the two theorems, we note first that they are equivalent results: each is a corollary of the other. Obviously, Theorem 1 implies Theorem 2: given any nonnegative function f such that ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) d ω > 0 , Eq. (1) immediately implies that ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) [ P ( ω ) − P 4 ( ω ) ] d ω < 0 , which is (2). Conversely, Theorem 2 implies Theorem 1. Assume to the contrary that (2) holds for all functions f ( ω ) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2, but that there is a P ( ω ) such that P ( ω 0 ) > P 4 ( ω 0 ) for some ω 0 ∈ [ 0 , π / 2 ] . It follows by continuity that there is a neighborhood I of ω 0 for which P ( ω ) > P 4 ( ω ) . Let f be the indicator function of this neighborhood, that is, let f ( ω ) = 1 , ω ∈ I , 0 , ω ∉ I . It follows that ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) P ( ω ) d ω = ∫ I P ( ω ) d ω > ∫ I P 4 ( ω ) d ω = ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) P 4 ( ω ) d ω , which contradicts (2). The contradiction shows that Theorem 2 implies Theorem 1, as we claimed. Because of the equivalence of the two theorems, it suffices to prove Theorem 1. Proof The squared frequency response P ( ω ) = | H ( e i ω ) | 2 of an orthonormal filter satisfying P ( ω ) + P ( π − ω ) = 2 and P(0)=2 can be written with the help of the general parametrization given in [10, Section 4.1]: all P ( ω ) of degree at most 4 can be expressed in terms of a free parameter a 1, P ( ω ) = 1 + a 1 2 ( 3 + a 1 2 ) ( 1 + a 1 2 ) 2 cos ω + 1 − a 1 2 ( 1 + a 1 2 ) 2 cos 3 ω . Now, by denoting a = 1 + a 1 2 ≥ 1 , we obtain the expression P ( ω ) = 1 + a 2 + a − 2 a 2 cos ω − a − 2 a 2 cos 3 ω . To illustrate this, Fig. 1 displays some of these functions P, by choosing increasing values of the parameter a. The spectral response of the Daubechies filter corresponds to a=4, and is the curve at the top, as indicated. Next, we can rewrite the latter expression as P ( ω ) = 1 + ( 1 + β ( a ) ) cos ω − β ( a ) cos 3 ω , where β ( a ) = a − 2 a 2 and a is any number satisfying a ≥ 1 . Also, P ( ω ) = 1 + cos ω + β ( a ) ( cos ω − cos 3 ω ) = 1 + cos ω + 2 β ( a ) sin ω sin 2 ω . Now, sin ω sin 2 ω > 0 in ( 0 , π / 2 ) . Hence, for any fixed ω , the maxima of P ( ω ) as a function of a will be attained at the maxima of β ( a ) . Since β ′ ( a ) = 4 − a a 3 , the unique maximum of β ( a ) in [ 1 , ∞ ) is achieved for a=4 and its value is max a ≥ 1 β ( a ) = max a ≥ 1 a − 2 a 2 = β ( 4 ) = 1 8 . We therefore obtain the unique solution P 4 ( ω ) = 1 + 9 8 cos ω − 1 8 cos 3 ω , which is the spectral response of the lowpass orthonormal Daubechies filter of length 4 (as it was intuitively illustrated in Fig. 1). □ Remark 1 The maximal principles expressed in Theorems 1 and 2 do not single out one particular orthonormal filter; they only single out one frequency response. The conditions of the theorems do not involve the phase of H ( e i ω ) , and both the minimum phase and maximum phase filters share the same frequency response P 4. Now that we have established Theorems 1 and 2, we direct our attention to the following result: Corollary 1 Daubechies filters of length 4 are the 4-tap orthonormal lowpass filters of maximum energy compaction in [ 0 , π / 2 ] . In other words, P 4 is the unique halfband 4-tap filter that maximizes ∫ 0 π / 2 P ( ω ) d ω . Moreover, this maximum is ∫ 0 π / 2 P 4 ( ω ) d ω = π / 2 + 7 6 . This is an immediate consequence of the preceding theorems and it confirms the results obtained in [10,11], too. Remark 2 These results are not valid for Daubechies filters of general length. The lowpass orthonormal filters of maximum energy in [ 0 , π / 2 ] have been described in [12], for an arbitrary length L > 4 . It suffices to check that the maximum energy filter of length L=17 given in that paper is not the Daubechies filter of the same length. Henceforth, neither Corollary 1 nor Theorem 1 nor Theorem 2 hold for all L. Hence, the final question is: could these results hold for any specific L other than 4? We prove in the next theorem that the answer is no, neither for Daubechies filters nor for other orthonormal filters. This constitutes one of the main contributions of this paper: Theorem 3 For L > 4 , there is no orthonormal lowpass filter of length L such that its squared frequency response P 0 satisfies P 0 ( w ) ≥ P ( w ) , 0 < w < π / 2 for every squared frequency response P(w) of any orthonormal filter of length ≤ L . Proof The squared frequency response P ( w ) = | H ( e iw ) | 2 of an orthonormal filter is any even trigonometric polynomial satisfying Orthonormality condition : P ( w ) + P ( π − w ) = 2 , w ∈ [ 0 , π ] , Positivity condition : 0 ≤ P ( w ) ≤ 2 , w ∈ [ 0 , π / 2 ] . If the filter has length L, the orthonormality condition says that P is a trigonometric polynomial of the type (3) P ( w ) = 1 + 2 ∑ n = 0 L / 2 − 1 r ( n ) cos ( 2 n + 1 ) w , where r ( n ) = ∑ k = 0 L − 2 − 2 n h ( k ) h ( k + 2 n + 1 ) are autocorrelation coefficients of the filter h. Thus, the squared frequency response of any orthonormal lowpass filter of length ≤ L is a function P of the type (3) satisfying two conditions: (4) Lowpass condition : P ( 0 ) = 2 , (5) Positivity condition : 0 ≤ P ( w ) ≤ 2 , w ∈ [ 0 , π / 2 ] . Let us exploit the fact that cos(2n+1)w can be expressed as an odd polynomial in x=cos w: cos ( 2 n + 1 ) w = ∑ k = 0 n a ( k ) cos 2 k + 1 w so we can rearrange the polynomial P of Eq. (3) as a linear combination of odd powers of x=cos(w): P ( w ) = 1 + ∑ n = 0 L / 2 − 1 b ( n ) ( cos w ) 2 n + 1 = p ( cos w ) = p ( x ) where p ( x ) = 1 + ∑ n = 0 L / 2 − 1 b ( n ) x 2 n + 1 , x ∈ [ − 1 , 1 ] so it suffices to consider algebraic polynomials p of degree L−1 of this kind. Notice that p can be rewritten as (6) p ( x ) = 1 + xq ( x 2 ) , deg ( q ) ≤ L / 2 − 1 and the conditions (4), (5) become, respectively, p ( 1 ) = 2 , 0 ≤ p ( x ) ≤ 2 , x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . First of all, we introduce the condition p(1)=1 into the expression (6) and obtain q(1)=1 so q(x)=1+(1−x)c(x) and p ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) + x ( 1 − x 2 ) c ( x 2 ) , deg ( c ) ≤ L / 2 − 2 . If L=2 then c=0, confirming that there is a unique lowpass orthonormal filter of length 2, which is Haar filter, corresponding to p(x)=1+x. In any case, the set S of such polynomials is S = { p ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) + x ( 1 − x 2 ) c ( x 2 ) , deg ( c ) ≤ L / 2 − 2 , 0 ≤ p ( x ) ≤ 2 , x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] } . Notice that p(0)=1 and p(1)=2; the positivity condition of p remains fulfilled for any x ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) whenever: 0 ≤ ( 1 + x ) + x ( 1 − x 2 ) c ( x 2 ) ≤ 2 , − 1 ≤ x + x ( 1 − x 2 ) c ( x 2 ) ≤ 1 , − ( 1 + x ) ≤ x ( 1 − x 2 ) c ( x 2 ) ≤ 1 − x , − 1 x ( 1 − x ) ≤ c ( x 2 ) ≤ 1 x ( 1 + x ) . So c must be a polynomial of degree L/2−2 satisfying (7) − 1 x ( 1 − x ) ≤ c ( x ) ≤ 1 x ( 1 + x ) , x ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . In other words, S = p ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) + x ( 1 − x 2 ) c ( x 2 ) , deg ( c ) ≤ L / 2 − 2 , − 1 x ( 1 − x ) ≤ c ( x ) ≤ 1 x ( 1 + x ) , x ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . Fig. 2 shows this admissible area for c(x). Its upper and lower bound functions are, respectively, (8) U ( x ) = 1 x ( 1 + x ) , L ( x ) = − 1 x ( 1 − x ) . Notice that U is an analytic function in (0,1] but it cannot be expressed as a finite degree polynomial. This property will play a crucial role at the end of this demonstration. Once we have set the new notation, we face the hypothesis of this theorem: we look for a polynomial p 0 ∈ S such that p 0 ( x ) ≥ p ( x ) , ∀ x ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) for any other polynomial p ∈ S . If it exists, it would be written as p 0 ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) + x ( 1 − x 2 ) c 0 ( x 2 ) . On one hand, for L=4, note that polynomial c is a constant, and the positivity condition implies that this constant c should verify c ≤ 1 x ( 1 + x ) = U ( x ) , x ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) so c should be less than or equal to the minimum of that function U: c ≤ 1 2 . This means that there is a maximal constant (say, a maximal polynomial c 0 of degree 0) which can be seen in Fig. 2. Which case is this? Of course, it is the polynomial p 0 ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) + x ( 1 − x 2 ) 1 2 which easily corresponds to 4-tap lowpass Daubechies filters. In other words, for L=4 we confirm the result obtained in Theorem 1. On the other hand, for L > 4 , we will show that this polynomial does not exist. This is not a trivial issue: to this aim, we will follow the next steps: (i) The upper bound function U is strictly convex (it is easy to verify that U ″ > 0 ). Hence, its tangent lines lie below U. (ii) Moreover, the lines tangent to U in points x ∈ [ 1 2 , 1 ] belong to the admissible set S. (iii) Finally, this will help us to deduce that such polynomial c 0 does not exist for L > 4 (and neither does p 0). So it suffices to prove items (ii) and (iii): (ii) We will show that l ( x ) ∈ S , where l a line tangent to U at a point (x 0, U(x 0)) where x 0 ∈ [ 1 2 , 1 ] . Its expression is l ( x ) = U ( x 0 ) + ( x − x 0 ) U ′ ( x 0 ) , l ( x ) = 1 x 0 ( 1 + x 0 ) + ( x 0 − x ) 2 x 0 + 1 2 x 0 3 / 2 ( x 0 + 1 ) 2 . For instance, the tangent to U at the point ( 1 , 1 2 ) is l(x)=(7−3x)/8. And this polynomial c(x)=(7−3x)/8 belongs to the admissibility set S, because its minimum is exactly (1,1/2). This straight line is also depicted in Fig. 2. Item (i) guarantees that l ( x ) ≤ U ( x ) , so the second inequality of Eq. (7) is fulfilled. For the first inequality, let us prove that l(x) only attains positive values in [0,1]. This assures that they belong to the admissible set S given by Eq. (7), since the lower bound is a negative function. To this aim, it suffices to show that, for any x 0 ∈ [ 1 2 , 1 ] and x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , (9) 1 x 0 ( 1 + x 0 ) + ( x 0 − x ) 2 x 0 + 1 2 x 0 3 / 2 ( x 0 + 1 ) 2 > 0 . Since the denominators are positive, it is equivalent to x 0 ( x 0 + 1 ) + ( x 0 − x ) ( x 0 + 1 2 ) > 0 . Notice that for x 0 ≥ x the left-hand side is positive and everything holds, whereas if x 0 < x we rewrite it as ( 2 x 0 − x ) ( x 0 + 1 ) + ( x − x 0 ) ( 1 2 ) > 0 but here as x 0 ≥ 1 2 we know that 2 x 0 ≥ 1 ≥ x so ( 2 x 0 − x ) ≥ 0 , and the second term ( x − x 0 ) / 2 > 0 , so Eq. (9) holds. This means that 0 < l ( x ) ≤ U ( x ) , so l belongs to the admissibility set S; hence the result stated in (ii) is correct. (iii) Finally, if there exists a polynomial c 0 ∈ S , of degree L/2−2, such that c ( x ) ≤ c 0 ( x ) for every c ∈ S and x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] then in particular, l ( x ) ≤ c 0 ( x ) because it has been proven that l ∈ S , and the degree of l is 1 ≤ L / 2 − 2 . But for every x 0 ∈ [ 1 2 , 1 ] this means that U ( x 0 ) = l ( x 0 ) ≤ c 0 ( x 0 ) ≤ U ( x 0 ) , x 0 ∈ [ 1 2 , 1 ] so c 0 and U are analytic functions which coincide in the dense subset [ 1 2 , 1 ] . Hence, c 0 and U should be the same function, but it is obviously false, because c 0 is a polynomial and U is not. Therefore, there cannot exist such polynomial c 0, concluding the proof.□ 3 Conclusion We close the paper with a brief comment on the meaning and significance of its results. Theorem 1 states a new extremal property of Daubechies 4-tap orthonormal filters: the frequency response of the lowpass filter lies above that of any other 4-tap orthonormal lowpass filter, in the frequency range ( 0 , π / 2 ) . Consideration of the zero diagram of the involved filters and of the position of their zeros gives some clues as to why the result holds. Nevertheless, we have also shown that this property is equivalent to the one expressed in Theorem 2: for any given weight function f, among all 4-tap orthonormal lowpass filter frequency responses, the one that maximizes the functional ∫ 0 π / 2 f ( ω ) P ( ω ) d ω is precisely the Daubechies filter. We have shown that Theorems 1 and 2 are corollaries of each other; thus, only one of them needs to be established. The proof of Theorem 2 can therefore be reduced to the proof of Theorem 1. A special case of Theorem 2 is worth mentioning: the Daubechies filters of length 4 maximize the energy compaction in [ 0 , π / 2 ] , that is, they maximize ∫ 0 π / 2 | H ( ω ) | 2 d ω . Since the amount of energy compaction is important for several applications, Theorem 2 helps to understand the effectiveness of Daubechies filters of length 4 in such applications (no other orthonormal filter of the same length can attain or surpass its energy compaction). Theorems 1 and 2, however, apply to 4-tap orthonormal filters only. They naturally lead to another question: do Daubechies filters of other lengths exhibit similar extremal properties among orthonormal filters? The answer is negative, at least for length 17: there is a filter of length 17 with better energy compaction than the Daubechies filter of the same length [12]. This suggests yet another question: could results similar to Theorems 1 and 2 hold for some other length? It turns out that the answer is negative—no Daubechies filter of length greater than 4 is an extremal filter in the sense of Theorems 1 and 2. In fact, our Theorem 3 gives a more general answer: no orthonormal filter of length greater than 4 can be an extremal filter in the sense of Theorems 1 and 2. This result is interesting in itself, not only because it showcases the very special character of the Daubechies filter of length 4, but also because it applies to the much richer set of orthonormal filters.

The model relies on the three-base periodicity and provides an estimate of the entropy associated with each of the three bases of the codons. We observe that the three entropy values vary among themselves and also from species to species.

        "doc_abstract": "The basic theories of compressed sensing (CS) turn around the sampling and reconstruction of 1-D signals. To deal with 2-D signals (images), the conventional treatment is to convert them into1-D vectors. This has drawbacks, including huge memory demands and difficulties in the design and calibration of the optical imaging systems. As a result, in 2009 some researchers proposed the concept of compressed imaging (CI) with separable sensing operators. However, their work is only focused on the sampling phase. In this paper, we propose a scheme for 2-D CS that is memory- and computation-efficient in both sampling and reconstruction. This is achieved by decomposing the 2-D CS problem into two stages with the help of an intermediate image. The intermediate image is then solved by direct orthogonal linear transform and the original image is reconstructed by solving a set of 1-D l1-norm minimization sub-problems. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed scheme. © 2010 IEEE.",

        "doc_abstract": "In the Sparse Point Representation (SPR) method the principle is to retain the function data indicated by significant interpolatory wavelet coefficients, which are defined as interpolation errors by means of an interpolating subdivision scheme. Typically, a SPR grid is coarse in smooth regions, and refined close to irregularities. Furthermore, the computation of partial derivatives of a function from the information of its SPR content is performed in two steps. The first one is a refinement procedure to extend the SPR by the inclusion of new interpolated point values in a security zone. Then, for points in the refined grid, such derivatives are approximated by uniform finite differences, using a step size proportional to each point local scale. If required neighboring stencils are not present in the grid, the corresponding missing point values are approximated from coarser scales using the interpolating subdivision scheme. Using the cubic interpolation subdivision scheme, we demonstrate that such adaptive finite differences can be formulated in terms of a collocation scheme based on the wavelet expansion associated to the SPR. For this purpose, we prove some results concerning the local behavior of such wavelet reconstruction operators, which stand for SPR grids having appropriate structures. This statement implies that the adaptive finite difference scheme and the one using the step size of the finest level produce the same result at SPR grid points. Consequently, in addition to the refinement strategy, our analysis indicates that some care must be taken concerning the grid structure, in order to keep the truncation error under a certain accuracy limit. Illustrating results are presented for 2D Maxwell's equation numerical solutions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In the Sparse Point Representation (SPR) method the principle is to retain the function data indicated by significant interpolatory wavelet coefficients, which are defined as interpolation errors by means of an interpolating subdivision scheme. Typically, a SPR grid is coarse in smooth regions, and refined close to irregularities. Furthermore, the computation of partial derivatives of a function from the information of its SPR content is performed in two steps. The first one is a refinement procedure to extend the SPR by the inclusion of new interpolated point values in a security zone. Then, for points in the refined grid, such derivatives are approximated by uniform finite differences, using a step size proportional to each point local scale. If required neighboring stencils are not present in the grid, the corresponding missing point values are approximated from coarser scales using the interpolating subdivision scheme. Using the cubic interpolation subdivision scheme, we demonstrate that such adaptive finite differences can be formulated in terms of a collocation scheme based on the wavelet expansion associated to the SPR. For this purpose, we prove some results concerning the local behavior of such wavelet reconstruction operators, which stand for SPR grids having appropriate structures. This statement implies that the adaptive finite difference scheme and the one using the step size of the finest level produce the same result at SPR grid points. Consequently, in addition to the refinement strategy, our analysis indicates that some care must be taken concerning the grid structure, in order to keep the truncation error under a certain accuracy limit. Illustrating results are presented for 2D Maxwell’s equation numerical solutions. MSC 42C40 65M06 65M50 Keywords Wavelets Multiresolution analysis Adaptivity Sparse grids Finite differences Consistency analysis 1 Introduction The Sparse Point Representation (SPR) method is an adaptive finite difference strategy introduced in [1] to calculate numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) constrained by initial and boundary conditions. Our goal in this paper is to show how the truncation error in the SPR evaluation of partial derivatives can be controlled, by regarding possible perturbations coming from the presence of irregular grids and the use of local scales as the step size. The SPR method combines the simplicity and accuracy of traditional finite difference schemes with the ability of wavelet coefficients in the characterization of local regularity of functions. In this sense, the method has two basic parts: the operational part, and the representation part. In the operational part, the background context is of an accurate and stable finite difference scheme L F D j in a uniform grid X j . In the representation part, the tools come from interpolating wavelet analysis. The data is organized by levels of resolution 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j , j being the finest scale level. In such a multilevel context, the key role is played by interpolating subdivision schemes, which are the basis for the definition of reconstruction operators, wavelet coefficients being precisely the interpolation errors at the new points occurring when going from one level of discretization to the next finer one. In the construction of SPR grids, the idea is to use the wavelet coefficients as indicators of the local smoothness of the solution. This is the main ingredient in the definition of the thresholding operator: only those points corresponding to wavelet coefficients of magnitude greater than a prescribed threshold ϵ should be kept in the adaptive grid Γ ϵ j ⊂ X j . A reduced number of points are found in Γ ϵ j , the grid being less refined in regions where the variation of the function is smooth. For PDE simulations in SPR grids, the scheme considers an adaptive finite difference version L a j . Even though the grid spacing in a SPR grid is not uniform, at each of its points the FD formula is applied using a uniform step size. Since required neighboring stencils may not be present in the grid, such missing point values are approximated from coarser scales by the interpolating subdivision scheme of the same order. Two aspects of this SPR scheme should be emphasized. Firstly, the rule is to choose the step size proportional to each point local scale. The goal is to be more economical, in terms of the number of operations to be done, than the procedure of calculating the stencils up to the most refined level. In fact, for those points in smooth regions with wide local scales, the number of stencil interpolations required for the application of L a j may be significantly reduced. Secondly, the SPR grid of a function may not be convenient for the SPR representation after the application of the finite difference operator. Therefore, before the application of L a j , the SPR grid should be refined by the inclusion of a security zone of new (interpolated) point values. For this adaptive finite difference strategy, a generalization of the concept of truncation error, which is the familiar basis of the analysis of difference schemes, is presented in [2] for unidimensional domains and for schemes of arbitrary orders. In the present paper, we extend the consistency analysis in [2] to bidimensional domains, for the particular case of the cubic interpolating subdivision scheme, and of fourth order FD discretizations of partial derivatives L r f = ∂ f ∂ r , r ∈ { x , y } . The purpose is to analyse the effect of using the directional local scale in the SPR scheme L a r , j instead of computing the FD formula with the spacing of the finest scale level. The sections of the present paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the main wavelet tools required for the representation part of the SPR method. In Section 3 we prove some results concerning the local behavior of the reconstruction operators, which stand for SPR grids holding appropriate directional local scales. We show that for grids having a certain tree structure it is possible to define such directional local scales properly. Section 4 is dedicated to the study of SPR adaptive finite difference schemes L a r , j . Firstly, in combination with the local behavior of the reconstruction operators, it is shown that L a r , j can be formulated in terms of a collocation scheme based on the wavelet expansion associated to the SPR. This fact implies that the SPR derivative can give the same result either using the point directional local scale as step size or using the spacing of the finest scale level. Consequently, the consistency analysis indicates that, in order to keep the truncation error under a certain accuracy limit, some care must be taken concerning two aspects. In addition to a reliable refinement strategy, it is also important to have an appropriate definition of the directional local scale which holds for certain grid structures. In Section 5, we present some illustrating examples of SPR derivatives for magnetic fields arising in the numerical simulation of 2D Maxwell’s equations. Concluding remarks are included in Section 6. 2 Multiresolution analysis on irregular grids As explained before, our goal in this paper is to show how the truncation error can be controlled, regarding possible perturbations coming from the application of an adaptive SPR scheme. Before going to this point in the following sections, we shall describe here the required tools from wavelet analysis in more detail. In a multiscale framework, functions are represented in different scale levels, and the main tools are appropriate transformations relating the information at the finest scale level j to the lower ones, and vice versa. In the context of interpolating multiresolution analyses, the input data f j contains the sample values at a grid on the finest scale level. After a transformation W T j , the output contains the information f 0 in the coarsest level, and d ℓ that keeps the details between a scale level ℓ and the next upper level ℓ + 1 . Schematically, we have f j → W T j f M R j = ( f 0 , d 0 , … , d j − 1 ) . In a uniform setting in 2D, each scale level ℓ corresponds to a uniform grid X ℓ . Starting from X 0 , the grid at the coarsest level with spacings Δ x 0 in the x -direction and Δ y 0 in the y direction, the hierarchy of uniform grids X ℓ , ℓ ≥ 1 is X ℓ = { γ = ( k Δ x ℓ , m Δ y ℓ ) , 0 ≤ k ≤ N x ℓ , 0 ≤ m ≤ N y ℓ } , where Δ x ℓ = 2 − ℓ Δ x 0 and Δ y ℓ = 2 − ℓ Δ y 0 . As indicated in Fig. 1 , its dyadic refinement X ℓ + 1 , X ℓ + 1 = { γ = ( k Δ x ℓ + 1 , m Δ y ℓ + 1 ) , 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 N x ℓ , 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 N y ℓ } , is obtained by the inclusion of new midpoints γ = ( 2 k Δ x ℓ + 1 , ( 2 m + 1 ) Δ y ℓ + 1 ) , γ = ( ( 2 k + 1 ) Δ x ℓ + 1 , 2 m Δ y ℓ + 1 ) , and γ = ( ( 2 k + 1 ) Δ x ℓ + 1 , ( 2 m + 1 ) Δ y ℓ + 1 ) . In a non-uniform setting, the principle is also to have the information data hierarchically organized by different levels of resolution. On this matter, we are concerned with a sequence of embedded grids Γ ℓ ⊂ Γ ℓ + 1 . It shall be assumed that Γ 0 = X 0 . For ℓ ≥ 0 , Γ ℓ + 1 ⊂ X ℓ + 1 is constructed from Γ ℓ by including some new points of X ℓ + 1 ∖ X ℓ . We shall denote by Λ ℓ the set of such new points in Γ ℓ + 1 ∖ Γ ℓ . Let f ℓ = ( f γ ℓ ) be the set of sample values labeled by the points γ ∈ Γ ℓ . As described in the following algorithms, for the definition of W T j and its inverse ( W T j ) − 1 , the main ingredients are reconstruction interpolation operators R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) that predict f ( ν ) at any location ν from the knowledge of its discrete sample values f ℓ at Γ ℓ . The wavelet coefficients d γ ℓ are defined for points γ ∈ Λ ℓ as the errors in this prediction. Analysis - f j → W T j ( f 0 , d 0 , … , d j − 1 ) • For ℓ = j − 1 , … , 0 Define f γ ℓ = f γ ℓ + 1 if γ ∈ Γ ℓ If γ ∈ Λ ℓ , calculate f ̃ γ ℓ + 1 = R ℓ ( γ , ; f ℓ ) , and set d γ ℓ = f γ ℓ + 1 − f ̃ γ ℓ + 1 Synthesis - ( f 0 , d 0 , … , d j − 1 ) → ( W T j ) − 1 f j • For ℓ = 0 , … , j − 1 Define f γ ℓ + 1 = f γ ℓ if γ ∈ Γ ℓ If γ ∈ Λ ℓ , calculate f ̃ γ ℓ + 1 = R ℓ ( γ ; f ℓ ) and set f γ ℓ + 1 = d γ ℓ + f ̃ γ ℓ + 1 . Reconstruction interpolation operators For input data f ℓ sampled at uniform grids X ℓ , the definition of the interpolation operator R ℓ ( ν , f ℓ ) , at any point ν , uses a classical interpolation subdivision scheme, which is done iteratively, as suggested in [3]. On the first step, we set R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) = f ν ℓ , ν ∈ X ℓ . Having R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) being defined for all ν ∈ X q , q ≥ ℓ , then the definition is refined to X q + 1 by means of an interpolating prediction operator P q q + 1 : s q → s q + 1 , where s q = ( s k , m q ) and s q + 1 = ( s k , m q + 1 ) are sequences labeled according to the points ( k Δ x q , m Δ y q ) ∈ X q and ( k Δ x q + 1 , m Δ y q + 1 ) ∈ X q + 1 , respectively. For other non dyadic points, the definition is set by a limit procedure. For non-uniform grids Γ ℓ ⫋ X ℓ , the definition of the interpolation operators R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) uses a simple modification of the classical interpolation subdivision scheme, as introduced in [4]. On the coarsest level, we set R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) = f ν 0 , ν ∈ X 0 . Having R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) being defined for all ν ∈ X q , 0 ≤ q < ℓ , then the definition is extended to X q + 1 ∖ Γ ℓ by means of the prediction interpolation scheme P q q + 1 , and it is set R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) = f ν ℓ , if ν ∈ Γ ℓ ∩ X q + 1 . For points ν ∈ X q , q > ℓ , the definition is set as in the classical subdivision scheme. Consequently, for practical implementations of the analysis and synthesis algorithms the crucial ingredient is the prediction operator P q q + 1 , which is iteratively used in the formulation of the reconstruction operator R ℓ . For linear prediction operators P q q + 1 , the reconstruction operators R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) can be expressed as R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) = ∑ γ ∈ Γ ℓ f γ ℓ Φ γ ℓ ( ν ) , where Φ γ ℓ ( ν ) = R ℓ ( ν ; δ ℓ ) is the reconstruction of the delta-sequence δ γ ℓ = δ ( η − γ ) , η ∈ Γ ℓ . Therefore, Φ γ ℓ satisfies the interpolatory property Φ γ ℓ ( η ) = δ ( η − γ ) , η ∈ Γ ℓ . From its definition, the reconstruction operators can also be expressed as (1) R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) = ∑ γ ∈ X ℓ f ̃ γ ℓ ϕ γ ℓ ( ν ) , where f ̃ γ ℓ = f γ if γ ∈ Γ ℓ , and f ̃ γ ℓ = R ℓ ( γ ; f ℓ ) if γ ∈ X ℓ ∖ Γ ℓ , and ϕ γ ℓ ( ν ) are the interpolatory scaling functions for the uniform grid case Γ ℓ = X ℓ . Furthermore, it can be proved that the multilevel wavelet representation holds (2) R ℓ ( ν ; f ℓ ) = ∑ γ ∈ X j 0 f γ 0 ϕ γ 0 ( ν ) + ∑ ℓ = 0 j − 1 ∑ γ ∈ Λ l d γ ℓ ψ γ ℓ ( ν ) , where ψ γ ℓ ( ν ) = ϕ γ ℓ ( ν ) , ν ∈ Λ ℓ . Under this functional point of view, the transformations f j ↔ ( f 0 , d 0 , … , d j − 1 ) correspond to the change between the basis { Φ γ j , γ ∈ Γ j } and { ϕ γ 0 , γ ∈ X 0 } ∪ { ψ γ 0 , γ ∈ Λ 0 } ∪ … ∪ { ψ γ j − 1 , γ ∈ Λ j − 1 } . In the case of uniform grids X j , this interpolating wavelet approach was introduced in [5]. In the context of nonuniform grids, it was first considered in [4], and then extended in [6] to discretizations by cell averages on the interval. SPR method In the above discussion, multiresolution analyses for point values on a pre-established irregular grid have been considered. The connection between the grid and the particular function under analysis has not been covered. However, in wavelet analysis this kind of irregular grid appears after the thresholding of wavelet coefficients. Therefore, different grids are usually associated to distinct functions and threshold parameters. The terminology Sparse Point Representation introduced in [1] is related to this kind of mapping between functions and grid point values. As interpolation errors, the wavelet coefficients can be used as indicators of local smoothness. Indeed, suppose that a connected region N , with diameter ≲ 2 − ℓ , contains γ ∈ Λ ℓ and the corresponding interpolating points required for the computation of d γ ℓ . Suppose also that the function f presents a regularity σ in a Sobolev space W σ , ∞ ( N ) , 1 ≤ σ ≤ 2 p . Then, | d γ ℓ | ≤ inf g ∈ P σ − 1 max ν ∈ N | f ( ν ) − g ( ν ) | ≲ 2 − ℓ σ ‖ f ‖ W σ , ∞ ( N ) , where P σ − 1 is the space of the polynomial with degree less or equal σ − 1 . This fact leads to the definition of a point index i ε ( γ ) which is based on the significance of the wavelet coefficients associated to γ , as compared to a certain given threshold ε . Therefore, according to these principles, the point index i ε is defined by i ε ( γ ) = { 0 if | d γ ℓ | ≤ ε for γ ∈ Λ ℓ 1 otherwise . This isthe main ingredient in the definition of the thresholding operator T ε . Thresholding operator (grid coarsening) Γ j → T ϵ Γ ε j • If i ε ( γ ) = 1 , keep γ in the adapted grid Γ ε j . • If i ε ( γ ) = 0 , remove γ from the adapted grid Γ ε j . This procedure led to sparse representations f S P R , ε j = ( f γ j , γ ∈ Γ ε j ) where only the sample values required to reconstruct f j with error less than ε are retained. A note about the notation In applications of this paper, there are several grids involved, with discretizations and reconstructions operators associated to them, and thus several multiresolution analyses. It is useful to keep a unified notation for most of the operations involved, independently of which sparse grid the discretization and reconstruction operators are associated with. For instance, we have already used the convenient notation f ̃ γ j = R j ( γ ; f j ) , γ ∉ Γ j . Similarly, the multiresolution transform, and the thresholding operators are persistently referred to as W T j and T ε , independently of the multiresolution analysis at hand. It is clear that always T ε f j = T ε f ̃ j . 3 Local behavior of the reconstruction operators From hereon, we shall be concerned with the case of multiresolution analysis corresponding to the prediction operator defined by central cubic polynomial interpolation. Cubic interpolating prediction operator P q q + 1 • At the old points ν = ( 2 k Δ x q + 1 , 2 m Δ y q + 1 ) ∈ X q , define s 2 k , 2 m q + 1 = s k , m q . • At the new points ν ∈ X q + 1 ∖ X q , use the formulae s 2 k , 2 m + 1 q + 1 = ∑ n h ( 2 n + 1 ) s k , m − n q , s 2 k + 1 , 2 m q + 1 = ∑ n h ( 2 n + 1 ) s k − n , m q , s 2 k + 1 , 2 m + 1 q + 1 = ∑ n h ( 2 n + 1 ) s 2 k , 2 m − 2 n + 1 q + 1 , where the coefficients h ( n ) are symmetric h ( − n ) = h ( n ) and vanish for even integers n ≠ 0 and all integers such that | n | ≥ 4 . The non vanishing coefficients are h ( 0 ) = 1 , h ( 1 ) = h ( − 1 ) = 9 / 16 and h ( 3 ) = h ( − 3 ) = − 1 / 16 . For the definition of SPR discretizations of partial derivatives, we need the concept of directional local scales a r j ( γ ) > 0 , γ ∈ Γ j , where r ∈ { x , y } . We have particular interest in directional local scales satisfying the following conditions. Local scale conditions (A) There is some 0 ≤ q ≤ j such that a r j ( γ ) = Δ r q . (B) If a r j ( γ ) = Δ r q , then γ ∈ Γ q . (C) If γ ∈ Λ ℓ , then a r j ( γ ) ≤ Δ r ℓ + 1 , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 . Under such conditions, we shall prove the following local behavior of the reconstructions R j ( ν ; f j ) close to a point γ ∈ Γ j , which is the basis for the consistency analysis of the next section. Lemma 1 Let us consider reconstructions operators based on a cubic interpolating prediction for a nonuniform grid Γ j . Suppose that at each point in Γ j we have defined directional local scales satisfying conditions (A–C). Let γ = ( γ x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j be such that, for r ∈ { x , y } , a r j ( γ ) = Δ r q , q = q ( γ , r ) ≤ j . Then ∀ ν ∈ S r ℓ ( γ ) , q ≤ ℓ ≤ j , R q ( ν ; f q ) = R j ( ν ; f j ) , where S x ℓ ( γ ) = { ν = ( γ x + k Δ x ℓ , γ y ) , | k | ≤ 2 } and S y ℓ ( γ ) = { ν = ( γ x , γ y + m Δ y ℓ ) , | m | ≤ 2 } . Proof By construction, R j ( ν ; f j ) and R q ( ν ; f q ) coincide on X q . By condition (B), we know that γ ∈ Γ q . Then S x q ( γ ) ⊂ X q , and thus the assertion is true for ℓ = q . The proof advances by induction for ℓ ≥ q + 1 . Let r = x . For ν = ( γ x ± 2 Δ x ℓ , γ y ) ∈ S x ℓ − 1 ( γ ) , we already know that the result is true from the previous step. The points ν = ( γ x ± Δ x ℓ , γ y ) ∈ Λ ℓ − 1 are not in Γ j . Indeed, if ν ∈ Γ j , condition (C) implies that a x j ( γ ) ≤ Δ x ℓ < Δ x q , which is a contradiction. Consequently, R j ( ν ; f j ) and R q ( ν ; f q ) are obtained by cubic interpolation from their corresponding values at the four points in X ℓ − 1 closest to ν in the x -direction. For ν = ( γ x − Δ x ℓ , γ y ) , the interpolation points are ( γ x − 2 Δ x ℓ − 1 , γ y ) , ( γ x − Δ x ℓ − 1 , γ y ) , ( γ x , γ y ) and ( γ x + Δ x ℓ − 1 , γ y ) . For ν = ( γ x + Δ x ℓ , γ y ) , the interpolation points are ( γ x − Δ x ℓ − 1 , γ y ) , ( γ x , γ y ) , ( γ x + Δ x ℓ − 1 , γ y ) and ( γ x + 2 Δ x ℓ − 1 , γ y ) . In both cases, the result of the previous induction step implies that R j ( . ; f j ) and R q ( . ; f q ) coincide at the interpolation points. Therefore, they coincide at ν as well. The proof for the stencil points in the vertical direction is similar. □ As indicated in [2], to prove a similar result for one dimensional reconstruction operators based on polynomial interpolation of higher degrees, in addition to conditions (A–C), the size of the stencils S r ℓ ( γ ) should be wider and other requirements should be satisfied. The generalization of such conditions to higher dimensions is an open question. Example For γ = ( γ x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j , let us consider the following directional local scales a r j ( γ ) , r ∈ { x , y } : (3) a x j ( γ ) = min { Δ x q , | γ x − η x | , η = ( η x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j , η ≠ γ } (4) a y j ( γ ) = min { Δ y q , | γ y − η y | , η = ( γ x , η y ) ∈ Γ j , η ≠ γ } , where q = 0 for γ ∈ X 0 , and q = ℓ + 1 for γ ∈ Λ ℓ , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 . The statements (B) and (C) always hold for the directional local scales (3) and (4). In fact, note that, if γ ∈ Λ ℓ , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 , then, by definition, a r j ( γ ) ≤ Δ r ℓ + 1 , and condition (C) holds. Condition (B) is always true for γ ∈ X 0 ⊂ Γ q , independently of q . For γ ∈ Λ ℓ , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 , we know that Δ r q = a r j ( γ ) ≤ Δ r ℓ + 1 . This implies that q ≥ ℓ + 1 , i.e., γ ∈ Γ ℓ + 1 ⊂ Γ q , and the result is also true for this case. However, the verification of condition (A) is more subtle and requires more structured grids. For instance, the x -directional local scale (3) does not satisfy the condition (A) for the grid Γ 3 ⊂ X 3 in Fig. 2 . Indeed, for the point ν ∈ X 0 , in the center of the grid, a x 3 ( ν ) = 3 4 Δ x 0 , which can not be represented as Δ x q for any 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 . Tree condition To facilitate the verification of condition (A), let us consider grids having a tree structure as follows. A grid Γ j satisfies the tree condition if for 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 : (a) for a point γ ∈ Λ ℓ of the form γ = ( ( 2 k + 1 ) Δ x ℓ + 1 , 2 m Δ y ℓ + 1 ) , then the two neighbors in X ℓ γ = ( k Δ x ℓ , m Δ y ℓ ) and γ = ( ( k + 1 ) Δ x ℓ , m Δ y ℓ ) are in Γ j (see Fig. 3 left). (b) for a point γ ∈ Λ ℓ of the form γ = ( 2 k Δ x ℓ + 1 , ( 2 m + 1 ) Δ y ℓ + 1 ) , then the two neighbors in X ℓ γ = ( k Δ x ℓ , m Δ y ℓ ) and γ = ( k Δ x ℓ , ( m + 1 ) Δ y ℓ ) are in Γ j (see Fig. 3 right). Lemma 2 For a grid Γ j satisfying the tree condition, the directional local scales defined in (3) and (4) satisfy the local scale conditions (A–C). Proof As observed before, it only remains to prove condition (A). Let us consider first the case r = x . We note that if the result is not true for some γ ∈ Γ j , then there is some η = ( η x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j such that a x j ( γ ) = | γ x − η x | < Δ x q , where q = 0 for γ ∈ X 0 , and q = ℓ + 1 for γ ∈ Λ ℓ , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 . We first consider the case γ ∈ X 0 . Therefore, η can not be a point in X 0 . Furthermore, since η y = γ y , then η ∈ Λ q , q ≥ 0 has the form ( ( 2 k + 1 ) Δ x q + 1 , 2 m Δ y p + 1 ) . By the tree condition (a), the two neighbors ( k h x p , m h y p ) and ( ( k + 1 ) h x q , m h y q ) are in Γ j . Since one of them must coincide with γ , we obtain that a x j ( γ ) = | γ x − η x | = Δ x p . Similarly, if γ ∈ Λ ℓ , ℓ ≥ 0 , then η can not be a point in Γ ℓ + 1 . Recalling that η y = γ y , we see that η must has the form ( ( 2 k + 1 ) Δ x p + 1 , 2 m Δ y p + 1 ) , for some p > ℓ . Again, by the tree condition (a), the two neighbors ( k h x p , m h y p ) and ( ( k + 1 ) Δ x q , m Δ y q ) are in Γ j , and one of them must coincide with γ . Therefore, we obtain that a x j ( γ ) = | γ x − η x | = Δ x p . The proof for the case r = y is similar, where the tree condition (b) is used. □ The grid Γ in Fig. 2 is an example of a grid that does not have the tree structure. For instance, the two points in Λ 2 do not satisfy the tree condition, since at least one of the neighbors in X 2 are not present in Γ . We observe that the tree structure is a more relaxed restriction than the cone condition, as defined in [4]. Cone like grids are supposed to have a smooth grid density variation. Tree like grids may occur with strong variation in the grid density, as the one indicated in Fig. 4 . 4 Discretization of derivatives In this section, the focus is on discretizations of partial derivatives L r f = ∂ ∂ r f , r ∈ { x , y } , based on the approximation scheme R j ( ν ; f j ) . For the uniform grid case Γ ℓ = X ℓ , it is known that interpolatory scaling functions ϕ γ ℓ ( ν ) are continuously differentiable [3]. Recall from (1) that R j ( ν ; f j ) may be represented as R j ( ν ; f j ) = ∑ γ ∈ X j f ̃ γ j ϕ γ j ( ν ) , where f ̃ γ j = R j ( γ ; f j ) . Therefore, the reconstruction operators R j ( ν ; f j ) associated with irregular grids inherit the same C 1 smoothness. Collocation scheme Given the node values f γ j of a function f on the grid Γ j , the collocation scheme ( L r , j f j ) γ is defined as the node values of the partial derivative of the reconstruction R j ( . ; f j ) computed at γ . That is, (5) ( L r , j f j ) γ = ( L r R j ( . ; f j ) ) ( γ ) . Using the representation (1), ( L x , j f j ) γ may be interpreted as the result of the action of the usual fourth order central finite difference operator (6) ( L x , j f j ) γ = ( L F D x , j R j ( . ; f j ) ) ( γ ) = 1 Δ x j ∑ k f ̃ ( γ x − k Δ x j , γ y ) β ( k ) , with β ( 1 ) = 2 / 3 = − β ( − 1 ) , β ( 2 ) = − 1 / 12 = − β ( − 2 ) , and β ( k ) = 0 , | k | ≥ 3 . Similarly, (7) ( L y , j f j ) γ = ( L F D y , j R j ( . ; f j ) ) ( γ ) = 1 Δ y j ∑ m f ̃ ( γ x , γ y − m Δ y j ) β ( m ) . Adaptive Formulation: L a r , j , r ∈ { x , y } Holmström [1] introduced the idea of implementing the finite difference schemes (6) and (7) in an adaptive fashion. For each point γ = ( γ x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j with directional local scales a r j ( γ ) , define (8) ( L a x , j f j ) γ = 1 a x j ( γ ) ∑ k f ̃ ( γ x − k a x j ( γ ) , γ y ) β ( k ) , (9) ( L a y , j f j ) γ = 1 a y j ( γ ) ∑ m f ̃ ( γ x , γ y − m a y j ( γ ) ) β ( m ) . In view of Eqs. (6) and (7) at level q , and assuming that the directional local scales a r j ( γ ) satisfy the conditions (A–C), these adaptive finite difference formulae can be formulated as adaptive collocation schemes. Lemma 3 Suppose that for points in Γ j we have defined directional local scales a r j ( γ ) satisfying conditions (A–C). If γ ∈ Γ j , and a r j ( γ ) = Δ r q , then ( L a r , j f j ) γ can be formulated as (10) ( L a r , j f j ) γ = ( L F D r , q R q ( . ; f q ) ) ( γ ) = ( L r R q ( . ; f q ) ) ( γ ) . As we will see below, the adaptive schemes L a r , j f j may coincide with their non adaptive versions L r , j f j . Theorem 4 Assume that for points γ ∈ Γ j directional local scales are defined satisfying (A–C). Then, the adaptive formulation ( L a r , j f j ) γ coincides with its non adaptive version ( L r , j f j ) γ at the points γ ∈ Γ j . Proof Let γ ∈ Γ j with a r j ( γ ) = Δ r q , q ≤ j . Lemma 1 assures that R q ( . ; f q ) and R j ( . ; f j ) coincide on the stencil points required for the evaluation of L r , j at γ . This means that [ L r , j R q ( . ; f q ) ] ( γ ) = [ L r , j R j ( . ; f j ) ] ( γ ) . But, since γ ∈ Γ q , [ L r , j R q ( . ; f q ) ] ( γ ) = [ L r R q ( . ; f q ) ] ( γ ) = [ L r , q R q ( . ; f q ) ] ( γ ) . Therefore, according to the equivalent adaptive collocation formulation of Lemma 3, we obtain ( L a r , j f j ) γ = [ L r R q ( . ; f q ) ] ( γ ) = [ L r , j R q ( . ; f q ) ] ( γ ) = [ L r , j R j ( . ; f j ) ] ( γ ) = ( L r , j f j ) γ . □ Consistency analysis Let L F D r , j , r ∈ { x , y } be the uniform finite difference operators as in (6) and (7). Given the samples f j of a function in a grid Γ j , consider the functions g r ( ν ) obtained by the application of L F D r , j on the reconstruction R j ( . , f j ) : g r ( ν ) = [ L F D r , j R j ( . , f j ) ] ( ν ) . For a refined grid Γ ˆ j containing Γ j , let g ˆ γ r = [ L a r , j f ̃ j ] ( γ ) , γ ∈ Γ ˆ j be the result of applying the adaptive difference scheme based on Γ ˆ j . We are interested in the error T E r in approximating g r by the interpolation of g ˆ r . That is, T E r ( ν ) = g r ( ν ) − R j ( ν ; g ˆ r ) . If we see the finite difference operator L F D r , j as playing the role of the r –partial derivative, then T E r can be interpreted as the difference between the r –partial derivative of the reconstruction and the reconstruction of the adaptive discrete r –partial derivative. In this sense, we call T E r the truncation error. The contributions to this truncation error come from two sources. • For points γ ∈ Γ ˆ j , T E r ( γ ) is the difference between g r ( γ ) , which represents the r –derivative computed by the FD scheme using the spacing of finest scale level, and g ˆ γ r , which is the result of using the FD with local directional scale. As stated in the previous section, this error can be avoided for fourth order schemes if for points in Γ ˆ j the directional local scales satisfy the conditions (A–C). Precisely, as a consequence of Theorem 4, g r coincides at γ ∈ Γ ˆ j with the adaptive finite difference values g ˆ γ r = [ L a j f ˆ j ] ( γ ) . This means that T E r ( γ ) = 0 for all γ ∈ Γ ˆ j . • Assuming that the truncation error vanishes at Γ ˆ j , then T E r ( γ ) gives the interpolation errors of g r at points γ ∉ Γ ˆ j , that is, the wavelet coefficients of g r . So, the question is what can be said about the wavelet content of g r outside Γ ˆ j . According to (2), R j ( ν ; f j ) only contains contributions of wavelets ψ ν l , ν ∈ Γ j . However, differentiation is an action that activates some other wavelets. Thus, components ψ γ l ( ν ) , with γ ∈ X j ∖ Γ j , may be present in g r ( ν ) . Thus, given a precision ε > 0 , the goal of the refinement process is try to construct Γ ˆ j to guarantee that | T E r ( γ ) | < ε for γ ∈ X j ∖ Γ ˆ j . As analysed in [7], in the context of multiresolution for cell averages, one may expect that the second kind of perturbation error can actually be controlled by a special refinement strategy for the construction of Γ ˆ j . In the context of interpolatory multiresolution analyses, this subject deserves further studies. 5 Numerical example Our purpose here is to analyse the performance of the SPR discretization of spatial partial derivatives using either local directional scales or the grid spacing of the finest scale level. As illustrating example, we consider the functions to be analysed as numerical solutions of the TE mode system of Maxwell’s equations for the components of the electrical E = ( E x , E y , 0 ) and magnetic H = ( 0 , 0 , H z ) fields μ ∂ H z ∂ t = ∂ E x ∂ y − ∂ E y ∂ x , ϵ ∂ E x ∂ t = ∂ H z ∂ y , ϵ ∂ E y ∂ t = − ∂ H z ∂ x , where ϵ is the electrical permittivity and μ is the magnetic permeability for the free space. We restrict the problem to the computational domain [ 0 , 1 ] × [ 0 , 1 ] , and Perfectly Electrical Conducting (PEC) boundary conditions are enforced, meaning that the tangential electric field components vanish at the walls, i.e., E y ( 0 , y , t ) = E y ( 1 , y , t ) = 0 and E x ( x , 0 , t ) = E x ( x , 1 , t ) = 0 for all 0 ≤ x , y ≤ 1 and t > 0 . At t = 0 , the initial conditions are H z ( x , y , 0 ) = e − 3500 ( x − 1 2 ) 2 e − 3500 ( y − 1 2 ) 2 , and E x ( x , y , 0 ) = E y ( x , y , 0 ) = 0 . Both fields E and H are sampled at the same uniform grid X j , with spacing Δ x j = Δ y j = 2 − j . The fourth order FD scheme is applied for the discretization of spatial derivatives. Since some extra virtual FD stencils outside the boundary are required, we use the anti-symmetry properties for E y at x = 0 and x = 1 , and for E x at y = 0 and y = 1 . Consequently, symmetry properties are assumed for the magnetic field at all boundary faces. During a time step n Δ t ≤ t ≤ ( n + 1 ) Δ t , the integration in time uses a first order Euler scheme for which the components of the electrical field are taken at the initial time level n Δ t to obtain the magnetic field at the next time level ( n + 1 ) Δ t . Then, the magnetic field at ( n + 1 ) Δ t is used for the evolution of the electrical field. To ensure stability and to get accuracy, the time step is constrained by the formula Δ t = 0.35 × μ ϵ × 2 − j . Such scheme is a generalization of the well known FDTD algorithm [8], in the sense that non-staggered grids are used in place of staggered ones and a fourth order spatial FD scheme replaces the low order one of Yee’s scheme. We refer to [9] for detailed dispersion and stability analysis of such a reference scheme as well as for 1D SPR simulations. The plots in Fig. 5 (left) correspond to simulation results for the magnetic field at three different times (ns) t 1 = 0.009 , t 2 = 0.584 , and t 3 = 0.876 with a uniform grid corresponding to j = 7 . On the right side of this figure we show the SPR of such fields, using cubic subdivision interpolation, by thresholding the wavelet coefficients with the parameter ε H = 1 0 − 4 . It can be observed that the SPR grids are non uniformly sampled, with density varying according to the evolution of the field. For these instances of the magnetic field, we compute the two contributions to the truncation error for the SPR derivative L x . Namely, at each point of the sparse grid, we first evaluate the information of the error coming from the difference of discretizations (11) max γ { | ( L x , j f ) ( γ ) − ( L a x , j f ) ( γ ) | } , corresponding to applying the FD operator either with the uniform grid spacing of the finest scale level or using the local directional scales. We test this error for the grid obtained after the enforcement of the tree structure and for the grid given by a refinement operation. Being sure that this difference of the SPR derivatives is negligible at all points in the sparse grid, next we evaluate the contribution to the truncation error at the points elsewhere. For the first contribution, the error is computed after the enforcement of the grid tree structure using the directional local scale (3). As a consequence of Lemma 2, and in accordance with the statement of Theorem 4.1, we observe, within machine precision, a zero truncation error. For comparison, we also consider local directional scales for γ = ( γ x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j by just taking (12) a x j ( γ ) = min { | γ x − η x | , η = ( η x , γ y ) ∈ Γ j , η ≠ γ } , which do not satisfy the hypotheses (A–C) for general tree like grids. For this form of directional local scale, we observe a significant truncation error of order 1 0 − 1 . Next we consider similar tests applied to refined grids. For these applications, we use the refinement procedure adopted in [1] that for each point γ in Γ j corresponding to a significant wavelet coefficient, i.e. γ ∈ Λ ℓ − 1 , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ j − 1 , its closest eight neighbors in X ℓ are included to form a refined grid Γ ˆ j . Furthermore, if ℓ < j , then its closest eight neighbors in X ℓ + 1 are also included in Γ ˆ j . This refinement procedure is illustrated in Fig. 6 , where the original grid is formed by the coarsest grid X 0 and one point γ ∈ Λ 2 . To form the refined grid, the sixteen neighbors of this point γ are included, eight from X 3 and eight from X 4 . For the refined grids associated to three time instances of the magnetic field, the differences (11) are also zero within machine precision, independently of the directional local scales used as step size. For this example, one observes that the sparse grids that come after the thresholding and refinement operators naturally hold the directional tree structure. Furthermore, both formulae for the directional local scale, (3) and (12), coincide. Table 1 shows the percentage of points, with respect to the uniform grid in the finest scale level, present in each of the sparse grids, either after the enforcement of the tree structure or the refinement operation. At the beginning, since the features of the magnetic field are highly concentrated around the initial pulse, there is a large amount of data compression. As time evolves, the circular wave front spreads towards the boundary, requiring more points to be represented. As expected, the SPR refined grids are more numerous than the grids obtained by just enforcing the tree structure. This table also displays the number of interpolations used in the computation of the SPR derivatives using the directional local scale (3) expressed as a percentage of the number of interpolations required to compute the derivatives using the step size of the finest scale level. In both studies, the savings in interpolations range from 87% to 70%, for the tree like SPR grids, and from 88% to 73%, for the refined SPR grids, the gain being more significant at the beginning of the simulation, when the grids have more sparsity. Being sure that using the directional local scale (3) the resulting truncation error is practically zero at the points of the sparse grids holding the tree structure, either with or without refinement, we turn to the analysis of the error contributions at points located elsewhere. We recall from Section 4 that outside the grid where the SPR derivative is evaluated the truncation error represents the wavelet coefficients of the function L F D x , j R j ( . , H z j ) ( ν ) . Our purpose is to evaluate the efficiency of the refinement procedure in capturing a good SPR for this derivative of the magnetic field. The results of such consistency analysis are presented in Table 2 , for tree like grids without refinement, and in Table 3 , after the refinement operation. In both cases, we extend the analysis by considering j = 7 , and j = 8 , and letting the thresholding parameter be ε H = 1 0 − 3 , 1 0 − 4 and 1 0 − 5 . As expected, a comparison of the results in both tables reveal that the refinement operation helps to reduce the truncation error, at the cost of less sparsity. However, the ratio T E w r / T E r , of the truncation error without refinement and the truncation error with refinement, seems to be greater than the ratio N P r / N P w r , of the number of points in the refined grid and the number of points before refinement. The plots in Fig. 7 illustrate this behavior for the magnetic fields at t = t 1 (top) and t = t 3 (bottom), for the variation of the threshold parameter ε H between 1 0 − 5 to 1 0 − 3 . For instance, we conclude from the curves in the top-left part, for SPR grids at j = 7 for the magnetic field at t = t 1 , that the refinement doubles the number of points but the truncation error without refinement can be 15 to 30 times larger, especially for ε H < 7 × 1 0 − 4 . At higher resolution j = 8 , the curves in the top-right part of Fig. 7 show that the gain in the truncation error double-compensates the increase in the number of points in the refined grid, for ε ≥ 1 0 − 4 . For smaller thresholding parameters ε < 5 × 1 0 − 5 , the impact of refinement is again very important in reducing the truncation error with low cost in the additional number of points. A similar trend is verified for the field at t = t 3 , as we can see in Fig. 7 (bottom), both for j = 7 (left) and j = 8 (right). These plots show that for larger thresholding parameters there is a balance in the reduction of the truncation error with the increase of the number of points in the refined grids. For smaller values of ε H , the gain in the truncation error with refinement can be very significant, up to 40 or 12 times larger than without it, for j = 7 and 8, respectively, with very low extra cost. The plots in Fig. 8 represent the normalized truncation error T E / ( 100 × ε H ) for the H z field at t = t 1 (left) and t = t 3 (right). Since the truncation error represents the wavelet coefficients of the function L F D x , j R j ( . , H z j ) ( ν ) , the conclusion drawn from these plots is that, after the refinement of the ε H –SPR of the magnetic field, we obtain a ε E -SPR for its x–derivative, where ε E ≈ 100 × ε H . 6 Concluding remarks In this paper we consider adaptive fourth order finite difference schemes L a r , j f j , for partial derivatives in the r = x and r = y directions, arising in the bidimensional SPR method. The information f j is formed by point values in a sparse grid adapted to the function under consideration, and the main principle is to approximate directional derivatives by uniform finite differences, using a step size proportional to each point local scale a r j ( γ ) in the corresponding direction of differentiation. Required neighboring stencils that are not present in the adaptive grid are interpolated by means of a reconstruction operator. The main results of our study are: • To preserve accuracy in such adaptive discretizations, the grid structure and the form of the directional local scales are important. Under the conditions stated in (A–C), we prove a statement for the local behavior of the reconstruction operator. This crucial result is the basis for the proof of Theorem 4.1 that guaranties that the adaptive SPR discretizations L a r , j f j coincide at the points of the adaptive SPR grid with their non adaptive formulations L r , j f j , where the step size corresponds to the spacing of the finest scale level. This result is favorable to applications of the SPR method, in terms of the number of operations to be done. In fact, the formulations L a r , j f j are more economical than L r , j f j , since they do not require the calculation of the stencils up to the most refined level, for those points having large local scales a r j ( γ ) ≫ Δ r j . • A grid tree structure and directional local scales a r j ( γ ) are defined satisfying conditions (A–C). • Furthermore, the consistency analysis indicates that, in order to keep the truncation error under a certain given precision, an adequate refinement strategy should be used. Numerical tests are presented for functions representing magnetic fields occurring in the simulation of the Maxwell equations. The numerical consistency analysis for such examples reveals that the structure of the grids that come from the application of the thresholding and refinement operators are sufficient to ensure a small truncation error. In fact, for the experiments of the present paper, the tree structure naturally holds for the SPR refined grids, which ensures that the adaptive SPR finite difference schemes L a r , j can be safely applied. However, in general SPR, the grids obtained after thresholding and refinement operations may not have the tree structure. Therefore, before the application of adaptive SPR finite difference schemes L a r , j , the enforcement of the tree structure after refinement is recommended. For further reading [10].

The tags are used to automatically associate a field location to the relevant database tables or records and also to access contextual information or services.

This work is part of an effort to implement a large-scale distributed cooperative network in the Douro Demarcated Region in Northeast Portugal, a region in which the effort makes particular sense due to the extremely variable topography and mesoclimates. The possibility of exchanging contextualized information and accessing contextualized services in the field, using well-known devices such as cell phones, may contribute to increase the rate of adoption of information technology in viticulture, and contribute to more efficient and closer-to-the-crops practices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

Keywords Context-aware elements Mobile devices Ubiquity Precision viticulture Site-specific management Services platform 1 Introduction Precision viticulture (PV) in the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) is still at an early development stage despite the economic, social and environmental benefits that it could bring. The DDR is located in Northeast Portugal and consists mostly of steep hills (slopes reaching 15%) and narrow valleys that flatten out into plateaus above 400m. The Douro river digs deeply into the mountains to form its bed, the vineyards being planted in terraces fashioned from the steep rocky slopes and supported by hundreds of kilometres of dry stone wall. These terraces and very steep slopes are the dominant element of the landscape, condition the layout of the vineyards and make transportation across the region difficult (Andresen et al., 2004). The DDR remains a remote, sparsely inhabited rural region, with an economy that is largely driven by the vine – or, more precisely, by a mosaic of vineyards with very variable topography and mesoclimates, and thus is an appropriate region for development of site-specific management (SSM). Issues that are currently constraining the rate of adoption of information systems (Kitchen, 2007; Alvarez and Nuthall, 2006) include the need for applications that fit the farmers’ working patterns, rather than the dependence on data handling procedures that are unfamiliar or unavailable to the farmers, and computer illiteracy. Further, agriculture-specific frameworks are often centered in the office rather than in the field. There is a lack of in-field support tools that effectively assist farmers in their daily practices: farming is not remotely done (Burrell et al., 2004). The interaction with information technology tools should occur closer to the crops, integrated in the farmers’ daily routines, rather than a posteriori, in the office. The pursuit of in-field solutions has lead to a large number of applications for collecting, processing and providing information to farmers. These applications, while potentially capable of performing operational tasks and/or providing decision support, remain limited in terms of their use in-field, a drawback that in part follows from their very nature: they are typically conceived for personal computers, as browser or standalone applications. Some recent examples can be found in Kuflik et al. (2009), Harwood and Hadley (2009) and Thorp et al. (2008). A number of mobile-based solutions have also been discussed. However, they also exhibit limitations in the ability to access the contextual information, since typically they depend exclusively on Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates to associate activities or operations to locations. A recent example can be found in Fang and He (2008), where a Pocket PC-based in-field fast information collection system is proposed. Charvat et al. (2006) proposes the MobilDat (Mobile Data Visualization and Updating), the goal of which is to design and implement a mobile solution and mobile visualization tool for sharing and updating spatial knowledge, focusing on forestry, interoperability and standardization methods and tools for mobile data management. Hornbuckle et al. (2006) describe a Pocket PC-based decision support system, intended to be used by farmers to improve surface irrigation system performance, which uses field-based inputs of the advancing water front collected with the GPS. In the case of the DDR, the farmers’ age and their low level of technological awareness are additional obstacles that must be addressed when designing a site-specific management (SSM) application. A critical question is how SSM will affect the economic and social structure of the rural communities. There is little scientific evidence to draw from, but the existing experience about the introduction of technology in agriculture and industry may provide valuable experience (Plant, 2001). It is safe to state that usability and contextualization are two characteristics of utmost importance in the development of any such technological tools. One approach to the problem of pushing the decision level closer to the practitioner is to tag site-specific elements, and design information and decision support systems that rely on them. This approach yields a reliable mechanism to quickly look up information or initiate a site-specific action. Due to the growing computational power of mobile devices, the decoding of tags is not a problem. Visual tags that depend on image processing algorithms are replacing the well-known EAN13 barcodes because of their ability to handle more data per tag area. Indeed, 2D visual tags and mobile devices are already being used in many activities. The traceability system described by (Seine et al., 2004) adopted 2D visual tags because they were the cheapest and they performed better in water environments than other identification (ID) technologies. The decoding can be made using widely available mobile devices, which gives consumers easy access to the product information and increases their confidence. Ampatzidis and Vougioukas (2009) have evaluated the use of RFID and barcode technologies in manual fruit harvesting to improve traceability. The feasibility of using linear and 2D barcodes was also explored by Froschle et al. (2009) in connection with poultry. The aim of this work is to promote open-source and easy-to-use PV decision support and management services that eventually bridge the gap between in-field practices and office-centered applications. For this one needs real-time contextualized in-field information, which can be obtained by using everyday “on-hands” technology in an innovative way. There is no shortage of applications. In fact, this work was partly motivated by the number of daily viticultural tasks that can be effectively addressed through the use of information technologies. For instance, fixing in each vineyard parcel a contextualization tag containing predefined static information about the parcel and an encoded Uniform Resource Locator (URL) makes real-time vineyard management a future reality. In this case, the tag data can be used to index remote web-based information and services; or it can be used as an entry point to a SSM application. By pointing his mobile device to the tag, the viticulturalist associates his position in the field with the database data. The association may work for upload as well as for download. The tag ensures that any data uploaded in the field becomes automatically associated with the correct database tables or records and, similarly, any data downloaded from the database will automatically match the viticulturalist's position in the field. For example, it is known that phytosanitary treatments and human intervention should take place as soon as any anomalies are detected (Magalhães, 1989; Fregoni, 1999). In fact, the underlying problems can often be predicted by the farmers, who draw on their accumulated experience and the relevant climatic data, which plays a key role. After pointing his mobile device to the tag, the viticulturalist may access the climatic parameters (humidity, temperature, etc.) at the current location; he may then upload any relevant observations or conclusions to the database – without having to worry about linking the data to a field location. This is of interest whenever data obtained on-site (disease and pest incidence, yield, etc.) needs to be uploaded to a database, or when the database has to be queried in reference to a particular field location. The automatic contextualization provided by the tags not only simplifies the viticulturalist task, but also reduces the response time and essentially eliminates the risk of input errors and database inconsistencies. The goal of this paper is to show how mobile devices and identification tags can be combined to render contextualized information and services to support in-field PV management practices. Section 2 overviews 1D barcodes or linear barcodes, 2D visual tags and Near Field Communications (NFC) compliant tags as key technologies to identify in-field elements and to access site-specific services. Section 3 presents the developed proof-of-concept framework application, which supports the vineyard practices. System architecture, client interface and the service-oriented platform are presented in Section 4. The fifth section draws conclusions, discusses what can be achieved with this approach and reveals some of the future work that is being undertaken to integrate these tools in a wider cooperative network. 2 Mobile devices and tags According to Plant (2001), when a new technology is introduced in a field of activity the demands placed on the workers’ skills increase. Mobile devices, mainly cell phones, are embedded in daily routines and represent the most common and widely used technology today. This suggests that educational level is not a severe barrier to their use and their adoption for site-specific management of vineyards may contribute to increase the technological awareness of the potential of PV, particularly in the DDR. Studies have shown that in Portugal, at the first quarter of 2009, the cell phone/person ratio was 140.6%, which is approximately 20% above the European Union average (ICP-ANACOM, 2009). As a rule, everyone carries at least one mobile device. This wide availability makes the cell phone an ideal tool for interacting with information technology and on-demand services. This idea gets reinforced by the current evolution trends in mobile devices, which suggest an enormous potential in using these devices to support PV management practices. For these reasons, mobile devices can be a key technology to promote ubiquity in PV by accessing data and related services. Fig. 1 illustrates the expected scenario, in which a viticulturalist uses its mobile device to access on-demand services and perform several activities that rely on the interaction between the in situ user and the office back-end. 2.1 Tag-based identification technologies Tags, as a machine-readable representation of data (Gao et al., 2007), have been largely used to represent data and to link physical objects to digital information. There are several tag-based ID technologies, such as barcodes, visual tags and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags that in combination with an easy-to-use on-the-fly decoding system yields an effective, powerful and innovative way of providing contextualized information and on-demand services. Table 1 shows a comparison between different types of tag-based identification technologies. Found almost everywhere, 1D barcodes, linear barcodes or simply barcodes are a tag-based identification technology that has the capability to store and represent data through parallel lines of different widths. They are massively used in retail commerce where a manufacturer can assign a Unique Identifying Number (UID) to a product, making automatic product management, tracking and inventory possible. In addition, a relational database can be created to relate this UID to relevant product information. Two-dimensional or 2D barcodes represent another early step in the tag systems technological evolution. They have emerged as the natural way to encode large quantities of alphanumeric data and to link objects to web-based information and services, through the encoding of an URL (Toye et al., 2005; Parikh and Lazowska, 2006; Rekimoto and Ayatsuka, 2000). Among the most significant 2D visual tags implementations are QR Code, PDF417, DataMatrix and MaxiCode. Table 2 summarizes their main characteristics. The QR Code open-source solution emerges as the most suitable solution for applications that require the decoding of large quantities of alphanumeric data and fast scan speeds (Chaisatien and Akahori, 2006). RFID is another well-known technology used in identification tags. It is often applied to a product for identification or tracking purposes. Although a very promising possibility, the massive incorporation of RFID tag readers in mobile devices remains unlikely in the near future (Seine et al., 2004; Toye et al., 2005; Falas and Kashani, 2007). Furthermore, despite the massive cost reductions of the past decade, RFID is still not cost-efficient for a variety of targets (Roussos and Kostakos, 2009). Nevertheless, mobile devices able to read RFID tags are emerging in the market, in the hope of simplifying the interaction between users and services and providing a contactless and secure payment method, e-ticketing being a likely application (VISA, 2009); It employs a technology known as Near Field Communication that stands for a new, short-range wireless technology evolved from a combination of existing contactless identification and interconnection technologies (Forum, 2009). The embedding of such technology in mobile devices will make available to the general public powerful contextualization mechanisms. It may also contribute to the goal of having a generic RFID reader embedded in each mobile device, pushing new solutions to product-based services. 2.2 Mobile devices as a tag decoding tool There are two distinct approaches to the decoding of linear barcodes. The first relies on optical scanners and is based on widely available, well established infrared technology. The scanners read data encoded by lines and spaces of different widths. The second approach is based on the digital processing of the scanned image. But optical scanners, although often used as readers, are not yet widespread among the general public and remain unsuitable for daily, in-field agricultural tasks. In contrast, decoding software able to operate on scanned images or on real-time images is becoming available on an increasing number of mobile platforms with built-in cameras and Java support. This makes them powerful tools for reading barcode data and associating them with products and services. Several barcode readers are freely available: i-enigma, Semacode, Kayva and UpCode, among others. In fact, the trend is to offer mobile devices and smartphones with built-in scanning software for linear and also 2D barcodes (Ebner, 2008). The decoding of 2D barcodes is typically performed by visual inspection systems to achieve a very high data decoding rate. This is important for sensitive applications like airport luggage control and the handling of passenger boarding passes (ITSC, 2008). The use of mobile devices with built-in cameras to read 2D barcodes is currently a popular research topic with several practical applications (Rouillard, 2008). Java software running on mobile devices and smartphones for coding and decoding 2D barcodes, such as QR Code, Semacodes, and DataMatrix, already exist and are freely available, making them a consensual answer (Rohs and Gfeller, 2004; Falas and Kashani, 2007) to the low cost decoding problem. RFID technology requires a rather different methodology to decode RFID tags since it relies on radio-frequency data transfer between two devices. To this effect, the reader and the tag exchange data through an inductive coupling that is also used for powering the passive tag. RFID readers can also work as standalone devices that communicate with a host system through some sort of interface (Roussos and Kostakos, 2009). This technology has evolved to mobile devices through the use of NFC. One of the very first commercial cell phones to incorporate this technology is the Nokia 6212 Classic model, which may contribute decisively to a more widespread use of RFID-based solutions. The fact that mobile devices are becoming able to decode 1D and 2D barcodes as well as RFID tags shows the potential of the devices in the context of ubiquitous precision viticulture. Mobile devices have reached a stage of development that makes them potentially able to support on-demand services and to assist in a number of management tasks in precision viticulture. 3 Framework for viticulture management services The Viticulture Service-Oriented Framework (VSOF) intends to overcome the general difficulties that occur when engineering and agronomics are brought together. The VSOF is a framework that supports some common PV practices, by means of a comprehensive approach based on farmers’ day-to-day routines, across all seasons and pushing SSM tools to the field. This is carried out with the help of a friendly interface specifically developed to be used in mobile devices, accelerating in situ information processing. An overview of the proposed VSOF architecture is depicted in Fig. 2 , which illustrates the interaction between the contextualization and/or indexing elements and the remote services platform. The VSOF framework uses visual and NFC tags, as well as GPS coordinates, to render contextual or indexed on-demand services related to tagged objects or products. The principle of operation is simple, and depends only on the availability of suitable decoding technology on the used mobile device. For instance, when a certain parcel of vines needs to be specified in order to obtain some information, GPS coordinates can be used, if available. Otherwise, if the parcel has been indexed by a 2D barcode (similar to the one depicted in Fig. 1), the mobile application can decode the visual tag and supply the required information. Furthermore, the 2D barcode can even be replaced by a NFC tag and still convey the required information. Although the decoding of multiple tag technologies is supported by the same software application, QR Codes and NFC tags provide additional and powerful features. On one hand, these elements can be used as a service indexing mechanism; on the other, they can also be used to store specific and static information, being decoded offline by the same software application. The VSOF framework is very flexible, and the process of rendering dynamic information and services that builds upon the tagged elements is almost straightforward. The mobile device application only has to use the decoded tag information to access a cooperative knowledge-based system where an information repository is accessed through HTTP requests. In the case of 2D barcodes and NFC tags, additional data processing is unnecessary since the capacity of these tags is sufficient to store a complete URL. However, linear barcodes and GPS coordinates do not have this ability. The difficulty can be circumvented by an additional procedure, by means of which an unique related URL is generated.The connection between the mobile device application and the information repository is always needed whenever a real-time interaction is required. This can be accomplished using any wireless technology such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), 802.11x or Bluetooth, whatever is available at the moment in the mobile device surrounding environment. For in-field operation, the user can also access the remote repository by using any specific access point, if available in range (deployed as an in-field cluster-head and gateway for wireless sensor networks, as described in a previous work (Morais et al., 2008), equipped with a 802.11 access point and Bluetooth). Offline operation is also possible with all the four supported indexing technologies. To this effect, the user can store tag information and/or GPS coordinates and postpone operation until connected. 3.1 The use of context mechanisms in PV practices The feasibility of the above referenced contextualization mechanisms has been successfully evaluated in PV environments for more than one year, using the experimental application prototype and VSOF. The simplest linear barcode is embedded in all products used in phytosanitary treatments, which is used to access useful and important information about the product and its prescription. In addition, the developed application can be used to decode bottle linear barcodes for tracking purposes as well as to retrieve information about grapes and parcels from where that wine was produced. 2D barcodes (specifically QR Codes and DataMatrix) have been also used to convey dynamic information. The additional level of indirection brings one additional benefit: the use of the same printed tag. Besides vineyard grapes and bard identification (which is regarded as static information, thus being obtained directly from the tag) QR Codes have been used in a management application of vintage tub rentals, where they are used to track tubs (Fig. 3 ). With several free online sites to encode data in QR Code format (for instance in these tags are being used in many other applications where static information is required as well as URLs to access dynamic services. Specific canopy management, farm integrated management and data entry points to SSM tools are among the most used applications of QR Codes under our PV perspective, where GPS has often to be discarded due to its lack of resolution.However, GPS coordinates remain useful for other purposes. They have been used to register the in-field variability as geographically encoded data, or to record points at which phytosanitary products have been used. Many other applications of GPS are described in the literature. The examples include yield measurement systems (Auernhammer et al., 1994) and ground speed measurement in variable-rate application equipment (Neményi et al., 2003; Keskin and Say, 2006). Since the use of NFC technology requires a new device, its use in agronomics is limited to applications where this technology presents an important key advantage over barcodes. Visual codes can be decoded by a mobile device equipped with a camera, but NFC tags may be written by a compliant device. This distinctive factor makes the NFC system a complement to the range of available tag technologies that can be used to access the VSOF. To this effect, the feasibility of using NFC tags in oak tanks or barrels in a wine aging management application in a DDR wine cellar is being evaluated. In this scenario, a NFC compliant device has been used not only to obtain winemaking related data but also to update tag information after performing operations on the barrel such as the dates of each analytical control and wine corrections. This is going one step beyond the passive tag, which simply associates data and position. In this case the tag is already an active element, able to work as a data destination instead of a mere data source. 3.2 The VSOF object model The VSOF follows the physical representation of a whole-basis farm, and is an UML (Unified Modeling Language) class model. It represents the conceptual overview of the management framework main classes and translates the physical construction of a vineyard main objects. These classes are the main entities that support the core of vineyard in-field information system. Fig. 4 presents the simplified diagram of this model. The main class is the Farm object, composed by parcels (similar to a vineyard management zone), which in turn are a composition made from bards which are composed by vines (canopies). There can be several viticulturists working on a farm, so the Viticulturist class supports this association and an authentication process. This example focuses the available services associated to the selected parcel, such as phytosanitary treatments and vineyard interventions, each one described by its own class. For example, the PhytosanitaryTreatments class translates applied parcels’ phytosanitary treatments and has three generalizations: Diseases, Plagues and Anomalies classes, each one translating a different vineyard treatment. 3.3 Mobile device application The mobile device application is the VSOF client software (called the Viticulture Management Mobile Client – VMMC). This client software performs three major functions: (i) tag decoding, (ii) association of tag data to an application item and (iii) accessing and interacting with the VSOF by issuing specific HTTP requests and receiving the contextualized HTTP responses. Full access to VSOF services is limited to registered users. Guests may use the VSOF platform to access public data and tourism services. The VMMC application starts with the user authentication. Personal info may be stored in a RecordStore (RS), which is also used to store the user profile. The functional overview of the VMMC application is depicted in Fig. 5 . The decoding engine is responsible for retrieving tag and/or GPS data from the corresponding Application Programming Interface (API). To allow barcode decoding, the selected device must support the Mobile Media Application Programming Interface (MMAPI), or simply Java Specification Request 135 (JSR-135), that enables access to native multimedia services. JSR-135 support is available in virtually every mobile device with a built-in camera. After selecting 2D or 1D barcodes capture mode, the VMMC application seeks for a valid pattern. During this phase, several recognition scans are performed. If a tag is not detected, an auto-zoom request is issued and the process is repeated. If JSR-135 is not supported in a specific device model, the application can load a captured photo and decode it in an offline mode. NFC support is provided by Java JSR-257, which is a standardized API that enables NFC applications to control the NFC interface. In a NFC compliant device, data from the JSR-257 API is handled by the VMMC in the same way JSR-135 is. At this stage of NFC technology integration, the interest of using these tags is to contextualize PV management tools, with the aim of in a near future integrating e-commerce tools and secured-based services that may assist these practices. The VMMC application also allows the use of GPS coordinates to index an open-field location and is thus suitable for retrieving a location-based VSOF service. To support the use of a GPS receiver, the mobile device must support JSR-82 as the common interface to an optional GPS external receiver. Embedded GPS receivers are supported by JSR-179 API that also supports external devices using, for instance, a Bluetooth connection. In the case of linear barcodes and GPS, the VMMC generates a specific HTTP request, where such data are used to index a related set of available services. 2D barcodes and NFC compliant tags may be used to store structured data, such as static information about tagged product, URLs or both. Following the flowchart of Fig. 5, and after the decoding or retrieving GPS coordinates, the VMMC generates a specific URL to access the remote VSOF server. While 2D barcodes and NFC compliant tags can be used to store structured data such as static information about tagged product, URLs or both, linear barcodes and GPS coordinates do not store a valid URL. In those cases, the VMMC application generates a specific HTTP request, where such data is used to index a related set of available services. To this effect, the application issues the appropriate HTTP request (the context key in Fig. 5) to VSOF, through the device native browser. The HTTP response from the VSOF (the required service in Fig. 5) is a web-page generated accordingly with the tag context, being different for each tag. In addition, information management, such as general-purpose data entry capabilities are also provided, as part of the interaction between the viticulturalist and the VSOF. Static information, such as text messages, stored in 2D and NFC compliant tags, are presented directly on the mobile device display. Table 3 shows two examples of URL generation based on 1D barcodes and GPS coordinates, either for VSOF registered users and public access. The VMMC application prototype was tested with the Nokia models N73, N80, N95 and 6212 Classic, HTC model Touch, Samsung model Omnia and SonyEricsson model K800i mobile devices. According to the Java specifications, any mobile device compliant with the specification CLDC 1.0 (Connected Limited Device Configuration) and MIDP 2.0 (Mobile Information Device Profile) has the minimum requirements to run the VMMC application. The installation procedure of the prototype management application requires it to be transferred once to the target mobile device, through any available data transfer technology. 4 Site-specific management application prototype To promote ubiquity within our PV scenario a site-specific management application, that serves as proof-of-concept for the VSOF, has been developed. The main goal was to illustrate the feasibility of using different tags to contextualize on-demand services, available in a cooperative knowledge-based network. It was conceived to help DDR viticulturalists and winemakers to register and read, in situ, site-specific information about vineyard management, including interventions and treatments. Simultaneously, an image upload and storage service was also implemented as a part of an automatic disease detection system. This particular feature allows an automatic picture-to-location indexing service which may be useful to register interventions and other vine characteristics. Fig. 6 gives an overview of the implemented services available in-field through the use of VMMC and VSOF. Fig. 6(a) shows a photograph of the starting page of the VMMC application, where there are presented the technologies supported by the mobile device for tag decoding. In this case, the VMMC is running on a Nokia N73 mobile device which has JSR-135 support only (NFC support and GPS data are not available in this model). To demonstrate the feasibility of using the VMMC application to register and read relevant information about wine corrections, the VSOF has been complemented with an oak barrels management application for a wine cellar, which uses NFC compliant tags to store winemaking data on the barrels themselves. For each barrel, Fig. 6(b) shows the available options in the VMMC application, running on a NFC compliant mobile device (Nokia 6212 Classic), with the following brief descriptions (translated from Portuguese): • Registo de entrada (Input record): Wine grape varieties and date when cask was filled. • Controlo analítico (Laboratory tests): Analytical tests performed and dates (pH, sugar contents, percent alcohol, available sulfur, acidity, among others). • Registo de correcções (Wine corrections): Fining agents and preservatives used during the wine aging process. • Histórico (History): Last month operations history records. To further demonstrate the feasibility of VMMC/VSOF for in-field management practices, a set of services that are contextualized by any available indexing mechanisms (Fig. 6(c) and (d)) has been implemented. Fig. 6(c) illustrates how the weekly inspections that need to be carried out on vines are managed. This is a textual input example: the user can register some common grape wine disease checks such as the caterpillars of the vine moth (traça da uva, Phalaenoides glycine), one of the most common pests of the grape vine, green sharpshooter (cigarrilha verde, Draeculacephala minerva) counts per leaf and the mean number of rust mites (acariose, Calepitrimerus vitis) per bud. As always, when a tag is decoded or GPS coordinates are used, all subsequent services are automatically contextualized, without the need for any further in-field element processing. Besides helping viticulturists’ daily in-field operations, this management tool can also provide a helpful scheduling mechanism for vineyard interventions and help to predict the occurrence of future vineyard's phenological states, through a continuous analysis of in-field registered data and interventions. Moreover, it can generate automatic reminders when a particular operation should be done. Fig. 7 shows a screen capture of the user management application interface VSOF. This interface is based on the Google Maps API, showing the position of each vineyard tag, each one corresponding to an entry point in the VSOF database. By double-clicking each tag, a balloon pops-up showing the most recent data uploaded by the VMMC application. Along with the photo and link provided to the climate data, available in the Info tab, the VSOF tab displays all the data regarding the selected parcel interventions. This MySQL database is managed using the well-known, open-source front end, phpMyAdmin, Fig. 8 . This data repository materializes one year of continuous recording of in-field operations, yielding a valuable experience and a sustained approach for the framework and prototype validation. In the example illustrated in Fig. 8, the SQL query was generated to retrieve all interventions regarding vineyard ID=00342 for the 2007/2008 season. 5 Conclusions and final remarks The feasibility of an integrated framework that supports the daily activities of viticulturalists in the field has been demonstrated. The system combines contextualization elements (tags) placed in the vines with readers based on widely available mobile devices. This circumvents one problem shared by many decision support tools and farm management applications: the gap between the computer-based management, carried out in the office, and the farm interventions, obviously accomplished in the field. Since in the target region (the DDR, in Northeast Portugal) the required mobile devices are very common, their need does not represent a strong or artificial constraint. In fact, given the level of computer illiteracy in the region, these mobile devices are the technology with which more farmers are highly familiar. In addition to this, usability and design issues – although not our main concern – have been carefully addressed. The implementation of the proposed SSM tools represents a major step forward in bridging the gap between the farmers and their requirements and the technology offered to them. The potential applications of the presented framework as a site-specific management tool for PV practices have been highlighted and a comprehensive set of prototype applications, that enhance the usability and usefulness of mobile devices in agricultural applications, has been presented. By embedding these “handy” tools in everyday agricultural practices, the vision of a truly ubiquitous, technology-intense PV can become a reality. One innovative aspect behind the VMMC application is its multi-tag technology decoding support, which is an important advantage when tagging or indexing different objects to initiate a site or object specific action. Towards the integration of agricultural tools in one framework, the VMMC application can also be used, without changes, in many other tasks, such as public information services or other contextualized data entry points within the whole-farm concept. Yet another advantage of tagging in-field key points follows from the dynamic nature of the information delivered. Indeed, new services can easily be added at the VSOF server side without changing the tags. As a result, the same VMMC application becomes capable of offering new contextualized services. For example, the end-user could request the weather data at a certain point, according to the closest sensors of a wireless sensor network (Morais et al., 2008). The continuing technological advances in mobile devices and their user interfaces may in the near future suggest new directions for research or answers to difficulties met today. Usability and user interface are certainly one of the areas in which more work should be done, accompanying the evolving technology (consider the iPhone and Voice Control, for example). As for the difficulties, it has been noticed that some LCD screens become difficult to read outdoors, in bright sunlight. Transflective displays, however, do not show this problem: they depend on LED backlighting indoors but have a reflective surface that produces very readable images even under direct sunlight. This technology will improve the usability of the described system and help to boost its rate of adoption. The work described is part of a long-term effort to introduce PV in the DDR. The outstanding characteristics of the region, marked by a deep symbiosis between wine and tourism, makes it an excellent test bed for innovative management techniques applied both to PV practices and tourism services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which in-field site-specific management concepts based on tags are applied to viticulture environments. However, the connection between the wine and tourism in the DDR region opens a wide range of possibilities: since most of the farms support wine tourism, the tags could be used by tourists to access public information and commercial services. The results so far are being truly encouraging. The flexibility of the proposed framework has revealed a potential that remains largely untapped, and is currently being explored to support PV and offer a number of additional benefits, such as e-commerce, tourism and other location-based services.

Fig. 1 Herbert Raabe around 1989, when he was about 80 years old. Fig. 2 The instruments on display at the museum of the Lehrstuhl und Institut für Nachrichtentechnik (Institute of Communications Engineering) at RWTH Aachen University give perspective on the evolution of telegraphy (including early telegraph multiplexers mentioned by Raabe, such as Baudot's, shown in Fig. 3), the evolution of telephone engineering (including exchange techniques, long distance amplifiers, electro-acoustics, valves and radio receivers) and the evolution of image transmission (including picture telegraphy and early television engineering). The museum provides background information on telecommunications at the time Raabe worked in his dissertation. Fig. 3 Baudot's time division multiplexer for telegraphy at the museum of the Lehrstuhl und Institut für Nachrichtentechnik at RWTH Aachen University (see also Fig. 2). Raabe's goal was to develop a time-division multiplexer for telephony, a problem that had been suggested to him by Stäblein. Raabe quickly realised that it required a “totally different technical setup”, since the ideas underlying the telegraphy multiplexers of Baudot or Delany were not applicable in the new setting.

(b) A sinusoid and the result of multiplying it by a square wave with a frequency six times larger. The duty cycle is small and so the result suggests the acquisition of six samples per period. (c) In this case, the multiplication yields a result very similar to the six samples per period shown in (b), but the frequency of the sinusoid is higher; it is a “noise frequency”, an alias of the frequency in (b). (d) In this case the frequency of the sinusoid is also above the reconstruction limit. Furthermore, the duty cycle of the unmodulated waveform is large. As a result, the multiplication by the square wave retains relatively long segments of the sinusoid. Fig. A1 Principal description of the time division multiplex transmission.

To Professor Hans Dieter Lüke (1935–2005), in memoriam This paper discusses the work of Herbert Raabe (1909–2004) and its significance in terms of sampling. Raabe's thesis, published in 1939, represents a milestone in the development of sampling, as pointed out in the historical works of Lüke. Raabe built and analysed the first time-division multiplex system for telephony, a task that required of him a thorough understanding of sampling, including sampling with pulses of finite duration and sampling of low-pass and band-pass signals. We analyse his approach, its significance from the viewpoint of sampling, the generality of its conclusions, and also the milieu that lead to his remarkable achievements: the exceptional research climate existing in Berlin at the time he worked. We also examine the connection between “Raabe's condition”, the work of Harry Nyquist (1924, 1928) on telegraphy and the so-called “Nyquist rate”. An English translation of the sections of Raabe's dissertation more closely related to sampling is included as an appendix. Keywords Sampling Multiplexing Raabe's condition Nyquist rate Historical review 1 Introduction Herbert Raabe's contribution to the sampling theorem only became known after the important historical studies by Lüke [1–4]. Raabe deduced a form of the sampling theorem in his doctoral thesis Untersuchungen an der Wechselzeitigen Multiplexübertragung and published it in 1939 in the journal Elektrische Nachrichtentechnik [5]. In contemporary engineering terms, Raabe dealt with periodic band-limited signals and their reconstruction from pulse amplitude modulated versions. In other words, the band-limited signal is first multiplied by a periodic square wave, an operation that leads to an amplitude modulated pulse train. When the pulses are sufficiently narrow, the pulse amplitude modulated signal becomes, for all practical purposes, a sampled version of the original signal. Fourier analysis of both the pulse train and of the original signal, combined with the use of the superposition principle, lead Raabe to his main conclusions. For details, see Section 3 (particularly Section 3.2). Surprisingly, only two years after its appearance and during World War II, W.R. Bennett cited Raabe's paper in his work on time-division multiplex systems [6]. In turn, Bennett's work was cited by Shannon in [7] as one of his sources of the sampling theorem (cf. Section 4). Raabe's work is remarkably important in connection with the early application of sampling in practice, for several reasons: • Raabe goes beyond theoretical sampling and actually builds a time division multiplex system that allows the simultaneous transmission of several sampled signals over the same transmission line and their separation and recovery at the receiver. • To achieve this goal he deals for the first time with sampling pulses of finite duration (sometimes called “natural sampling”). • He derives the general condition for “distortionless transmission” (sampling at “twice the highest signal frequency”) but he also shows himself in complete command of the band-pass case. • He presents all the details pertaining to the analysis and construction of the electronic circuits needed to build the system. As expected for a work completed in 1939, the circuits are based on vacuum tubes. • He takes into account the impossibility of generating ideal (rectangular) pulses and accounts for the distortions that they necessarily undergo when transmitted through a real line with nonzero resistance, capacitance and inductance. • He discusses the crosstalk that occurs due to the “spreading-out” of the pulses from one channel into the adjacent channels, as the result of the use of non-ideal pulses and transmission lines. • He includes oscillograms of the signals obtained from his prototype. Despite these outstanding characteristics and the historical study by Lüke [3], no in-depth commentary of Raabe's work exists, and the original article of 1939 is no longer readily accessible. One of the purposes of the present paper is to bridge this gap and to discuss the significance and impact of Raabe's work in the early development of sampling and information theory. An English translation of the sections of Raabe's paper that are especially relevant for this is included as an appendix. To understand Raabe's scientific growth it is appropriate to take a look at the exceptional research climate existing in Berlin during his time. Section 2 provides this background information, together with a brief biography of Raabe. Since Raabe's work was completed nearly 70 years ago, it uses a technical language that is not always easy to follow for the contemporary reader. Therefore, in Section 3, we comment on Raabe's approach, its significance from the viewpoint of sampling and the generality of its conclusions. Raabe's condition, its impact and the connection with the Nyquist rate are discussed in Section 4. 2 Herbert Raabe (1909–2004) and his background 2.1 A brief biography of Raabe Herbert P. Raabe (Fig. 1 ) was born on August 15, 1909, in Halle, Germany. He attended the Humboldt Oberrealschule in Zeitz, receiving the graduation certificate in 1929. Subsequently he studied electrical engineering and telecommunications at the Technische Hochschule Berlin (TH Berlin), receiving the Diplom in 1936. In 1937 he became a research assistant and in December 1939 an Oberingenieur at the Chair in Telecommunications of Professors Wilhelm Stäblein (1900–1945) and Karl Küpfmüller (1897–1977), who between 1935 and 1936 had been responsible for the vacant chair in Telecommunications. In 1939 Raabe earned his doctorate (summa cum laude) with the dissertation Untersuchungen an der wechselzeitigen Mehrfachübertragung which appeared in 1939 in the journal Elektrische Nachrichtentechnik [5] and in which he describes the time division multiplexing system discussed in the present paper. The thesis was supervised by Stäblein and Heinrich Fassbender (1884–1970), who had been professor of high-frequency engineering at TH Berlin since 1918. After Stäblein's death, Raabe was put in charge 1 1 For a few weeks only, since Stäblein's died on February 20, 1945, in an air raid, and the TH Berlin was shut down on April 20, 1945. of the chair as well as a section of the Heinrich Hertz Institut. During World War II Raabe developed radar techniques at this institute. He was not reappointed as Oberingenieur at the TH Berlin after the War as he had been a member of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party). Raabe sent his Erinnerungen (personal recollections) [8] to Prof. P. Noll (Berlin), in a communication dated December 20, 1994. These highlight his time in Berlin up to 1947 and show his practical experiences in signal processing and radar in a new perspective. He speaks of his influences on his profession, and also singles out some of his teachers for special mention. These include three electrical engineers whom we have already met; Fassbender (whose lectures especially appealed to him), Küpfmüller and Stäblein. He also mentions another electrical engineer, Rudolf Franke (1870–1962) who was known as the “Schöpfer der Fernmeldetechnik”; Franke had been a student of Franz Reuleaux. Another of his favourite teachers was the physicist Gustav Hertz (1887–1975), the Nobel Laureate. Küpfmüller had suggested to Raabe a dissertation topic that did not at all appeal to him; it was Stäblein who had proposed multiplex transmission, the topic of his thesis. Raabe also goes into the work of Schreyer (who played a major rôle in engineering circles in South America after World War II) and computer pioneer Konrad Zuse; Section 2.2 discusses Raabe's background in Berlin in more detail. As early as 1931 Raabe worked on radio receiver circuitry and in the Summer of 1934 on signalling equipment for ships at Kiel Harbour. In the Fall of 1939, Wernher von Braun, his good friend, came to Berlin with his assistant Ernst Steinhof to discuss rocket developments. Raabe worked on the steering systems for the A-4 and later the V-2 rockets; he addressed what had been a difficult unsolved problem, connected with their distance and speed. A special recollection was being called by the Luftwaffe to Calais where a radar station wanted to be able to distinguish aircraft from a countermeasure known as Düppel, that is, radar-reflecting metallic strips, also known as “chaff” or “window”. 2 2 The British started to use “window” in July 1943 [9]. Raabe's visit to Calais probably took place shortly after this date. The dimension of the strips was tuned to the radar's signal wavelength. Raabe's reply, in five minutes: change the modulation frequency. In 1944 he was commissioned to instruct interceptor aircraft pilots to distinguish between fighter bombers and chaff. He also considered range deception techniques, and he mentions one device, the Rebok, which transmitted back a received radio impulse after a certain delay. His suggestion was to implement the variable delay 3 3 The basic range deception technique involves sending back an amplified copy of the received radar impulse, and then a delayed, weaker replica. The first signal forces the radar's receiver automatic gain controller to decrease its sensitivity and therefore to ignore the true echo. The receiver then takes the weaker replica as the true echo and detects a “phantom target”. If the delay is gradually increased, the phantom target will appear to be receding. by transmitting an impulse ultrasonically through a water container. The suggestion could not be carried out in practice, as the Berlin institute was destroyed by bombs. In 1947 Raabe was invited by the US Air Force to work as a Technical Consultant. In 1956 he joined the Electronics Division of General Mills/Litton Industries, developing novel radar technologies and electromagnetic counter-measures. From 1966 to 1974 he was employed with the IBM Federal Systems Division. He advised NASA on the design of Microwave Landing System (MLS) for the space shuttle. Even after retirement in 1974 he continued to be very active. In 1989 Raabe was commemorated at Kleinheubach, Germany, upon the 50th anniversary of the publication of his doctoral thesis. Raabe, who was the author of 15 articles and 19 patents, died 4 4 The obituary published in a local newspaper, the Potomac Almanac, in September 15, 2004, is still available at on August 25, 2004, in Potomac, Maryland, where he had resided since 1968. 2.2 The research milieu in Berlin 1930–1940 To understand Raabe's scientific growth it is appropriate to look at the exceptional research climate existing not only at the TH Berlin [10] but in Berlin itself and its industrial firms with their research centres during his time. The heart of the TH Berlin was no doubt their Mechanical Engineering Department, its internationally known professor from 1864 to 1896 being Franz Reuleaux (1829–1905). Born in a suburb of Aachen and regarded as the chief spokesman for German engineers from about 1870 to 1890, Reuleaux [11, pp. 74–75] was considered the founder of modern kinematics as an independent discipline. In this department, two independent major directions developed, Electrical Engineering in 1886, Shipbuilding in 1894. The first to hold a chair in the former was Adolf Slaby (1849–1913). Rudolf Franke (1870–1962) [12], who had a Chair in Telecommunications, was one of the teachers whom Raabe mentions in his recollections [8], along with Stäblein and Küpfmüller. Küpfmüller [13, pp. 96–102] [14], who began working at the renowned Siemens & Halske AG [13,15] in 1921, becoming its director of development and research in 1937 but remaining as Honorary Professor, is known for his seminal work in almost all fields of electrical engineering. He became Full Professor in Danzig at the age of 30. As well as holding a chair at TH Berlin, Stäblein was simultaneously departmental manager of the Heinrich Hertz Institut für Schwingungsforschung (Oscillation and Vibration Institute), founded 1927 by K.W. Wagner (1883–1953) [16] (who was dismissed in 1936 seemingly because of his opposition to Nazism 5 5 It is estimated that between 1100 and 2500 professors of all categories at German universities and scientific academies were dismissed on racial or political grounds during the period 1933–1940 (see [17] and references therein). The fate of 187 mathematicians forced to leave Germany and Austria has been documented in a series of papers by Maximilian Pinl, but no such work appears to have been done for the engineers or other professional classes. ). The fact that Küpfmüller's first position in 1919 was with K.W. Wagner at the “Telegraphen Versuchsanstalt” also confirms the close interaction between these persons. One of Stäblein's assistants was Helmut Schreyer (1912–1985), an engineer at the Institute of Telecommunications. Together they took a hand in advising Konrad Zuse (1910–1995) [18] on the design of his electrical calculating machine, which was in fact the world's first binary digital computer. It was called the Z3 and was completed in 1941. 6 6 The Z3 was never put to use during World War II, unlike the Colossus I, in operation at Bletchley Park by February 1944. However, the Colossus was not an all purpose computer, but instead it was designed to decipher high-level German messages. Built by the engineer Tommy Flowers, with input by the mathematician Max Newman, it was the young Cambridge mathematician Bill Tutte (1917–2002) who brilliantly exploited a transmission error of August 30, 1941, to discover the basic structure of the German Lorenz SZ 40 / 42 encryption machine. In Bletchley Park, Tutte was “the giant on whose shoulders everybody was standing, including Alan Turing” [19]. Tutte's breakthrough lead to the Colossus I (which was followed by nine others). Tutte, who received his doctorate from Cambridge in 1948, then taught at the University of Toronto (one of the authors, P.L.B., attended his topology course there) and since 1962 at Waterloo, has been described as “the leading graph and matroid theorist of his generation” [20]. The Enigma code, the German cipher system, was first broken by Polish mathematicians in 1933, their leaders being Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski. They used information supplied by the French cryptographer Gustave Bertrand, obtained from a spy. In 1939, just before the war, the Poles managed to flee; they gave France (via G. Bertrand) and Britain replicas of the Enigma encoding machine, and disclosed their decoding procedures [21]. These facts were only recognised much later. According to I.J. Good [19], Turing was secretive regarding his sources and the work of the Polish team. The first working models of an all-purpose digital computer devised in the U.S.A., at MIT, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania (ENIAC), Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the Institute of Advanced Study and Caltech, were in operation only at the end of the war. The Harvard Mark I was completed August 1944, the ENIAC February 1946. The driving force in all projects from the late 1920s to the 1940s, was Vannevar Bush (1890–1974; later as chairman of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, or OSRD). Mathematicians involved in the design were Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann [22]. At MIT, Bush was a great mentor of Shannon, supervising his prizewinning master and doctoral thesis. As to the history of computing see the volume edited by Metropolis, Howlett and Rota [23] as well as the books by Ceruzzi [24,25]. In addition to Küpfmüller and Stäblein, R. Franke, Gustav Hertz, Richard Becker (1887–1955) and W. Cauer (1900–1945) also worked at the TH Berlin 7 7 See [26], and also the web link which includes biographies and other useful historical information pertaining to the TH/TU Berlin. ; the Nobel laureates D. Gabor and E. Wigner, who received their doctorates at the TH Berlin—“but sneaked over as often as possible to the University of Berlin where physics at that time was at its apogee, with Einstein, Planck, Nernst and von Laue”—left Germany in 1933 when Hitler came to power. Of the 36 Nobel prizes awarded in the natural sciences during the period 1919–1933, a third were awarded to those active in Germany, especially in Berlin, some names being Einstein, von Laue, Planck, Heisenberg, and Gustav Hertz. Such was the research environment while Raabe was working on his thesis, the main ideas of which are discussed in the next section. 3 Raabe's approach and results 3.1 The time-division multiplexing problem in telephony To the engineer, the word “multiplexing” immediately suggests the simultaneous (or apparently simultaneous) transmission of multiple signals through the same wire or channel, and their recovery at the receiving end. The two simplest ways of achieving it are time division and frequency division multiplexing. In the case of frequency division multiplexing, the frequency band available for transmission is divided into intervals, called sub-bands. Each signal to be transmitted is assigned one of the sub-bands, through a process called modulation. A discussion of some pioneering developments related to frequency-division multiplexing can be found in [27,28]. Time division multiplexing, as the name suggests, is based on time sharing. The period of time available for the transmission is divided into intervals, and each transmitter is assigned one such interval in turn. The duration of each interval is typically very small compared with the duration of the messages, so that to an observer the multiple transmissions appear to be happening simultaneously. Raabe deals only with time division multiplexing. At the time he wrote (Figs. 2 and 3 ), time division multiplexing had been applied to telegraphy [29], and Raabe mentions two telegraph multiplexing systems: the Baudot 8 8 Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot (1845–1903), born in Magneux, France, September 11, 1845. A telegraph engineer and one of the pioneers of telecommunications, he worked in the development of fast telegraphy, and invented the Baudot system for simultaneous transmission of several signals over the same wire (Fig. 3). The Baudot time division multiplexing system followed previous work by F.C. Bakewell (1848), A.V. Newton (1851), M.B. Farmer (1853) and especially B. Meyer (1870). Baudot also invented the Baudot code, a predecessor of the ASCII code. The term “baud”, a measure of the number of symbols transmitted per second, is named after him. system, and the Delany 9 9 Patrick Bernard Delany (1845–1924) was born in King's County, Ireland, on January 28, 1845, and moved to the United States in 1854. By the age of 16 he was already an accomplished telegraphist and became chief operator of the Franklin Telegraph Company, assistant general superintendent of the Southern and Atlantic Telegraph Company and superintendent of the Automatic Telegraph Company. He left telegraphy and became a newspaper correspondent at Washington and subsequently editor of Old Commonwealth, Harrisonburg, Virginia. From 1880 onwards he turned his attention to inventing. He obtained over one hundred patents, mostly related to telegraphy. He developed a multiplexing system which built on previous work by P. LaCour of Copenhagen. The Delany system had advantages over the Baudot system, and impressed W.H. Preece, FRS, [30], being adopted by the British post-office. For his work in high speed and synchronous telegraphy, the Franklin Institut awarded Delany the John Scott Medal in 1885 and the Elliot Cresson Medal in 1886 and 1896. system. In fact, the opening sentences and his first diagram refer to the idea that underlies time division multiplexing: Two synchronised rotating switches connect several transmitters to an equal number of receivers. After connecting the transmitter 1 to the corresponding receiver throughout a certain interval, the switch moves to the next position and connects the transmitter and receiver 2 for another interval of the same duration and so on until the connection of the last transmitter and receiver. Afterwards the sequence starts again, leading once more to the connection of the transmitter and receiver 1 and so on cyclically. The mathematical model that describes the multiplexing of any finite number of signals is simple. Assuming as an example that there are three channels, the relevant signals would be related as shown in the diagram in Fig. 4 . The multiplexing system can be regarded as a multi-channel system, with inputs x 1 ( t ) , x 2 ( t ) and x 3 ( t ) and one output m ( t ) given by m ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 3 s i ( t ) x i ( t ) . The extension to any finite number of channels should be clear. The multiplexed signal m ( t ) would be transmitted to the receiver, where the separation of x 1 ( t ) , x 2 ( t ) and x 3 ( t ) from the input m ( t ) takes place. The receiver is illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 5 . It is again a multi-channel system that takes m ( t ) as the input and ideally would yield x 1 ( t ) , x 2 ( t ) and x 3 ( t ) as outputs. The existence of the operator H, which reconstructs the signals x i ( t ) from s i ( t ) m ( t ) , cannot be taken for granted due to the apparent loss of information in the process. As Raabe writes, ( … ) those sections of the function which fall within the instants of switching will not be transmitted. The received signal is therefore different from the transmitted one. Raabe points out that the Delany multiplexing system was intended for telegraphy, and that its application to telephony requires a “totally different technical setup”. In fact it requires a new theoretical approach as well, which Raabe provides in the first part of his paper. He gives a condition that guarantees that there is no “distortion”, that is, each of the input (multiplexed) signals can be recovered (theoretically) without any error. The condition is expressed, as we will soon find, in terms of the spectrum of the signals that are to be multiplexed and in terms of the sampling frequency, that is, the rate at which each particular channel is connected to the multiplexing system, which is also given by the frequency of any of the square waves s 1 ( t ) , s 2 ( t ) or s 3 ( t ) . The “sections of the function” mentioned by Raabe could as well be called “local averages” or “samples”, since they are determined by the product of the function by square waves such as s 1 ( t ) , s 2 ( t ) and s 3 ( t ) in our example. In a typical application, the width of the pulses would be small when compared to the sampling period. In Raabe's Fig. A8 the pulses are relatively wide, but for example in his Fig. A5 they are so narrow that they appear as “line needles”. A condition that ensures that each multiplexed signal is recovered without distortion means, under Raabe's framework, that each signal can be recovered from its “samples”. And since Raabe is interested in building the system, he cannot merely state a condition for transmission without distortion—he has to describe a practical recovery procedure as well. In other words, he determines a practical approximation to the reconstruction operator H. 3.2 Raabe's condition for distortionless transmission To understand Raabe's point of view, it is necessary to obtain the Fourier expansion of the square waves that will be multiplied by the signals to be multiplexed. Any such square wave, s ( t ) , say, can be translated at will without loss of generality, and he translates it so that it becomes an even function (see his Fig. A3). The Fourier series is given by his equation (3), repeated here for convenience: s ( t ) = k 2 π y m + ∑ n = 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n 2 n π y m sin nk 2 cos n ω 1 t . Here, y m is the height of each pulse, ω 1 is the angular sampling frequency, and k / ω 1 is the width of the pulse. In electrical engineering, the ratio of the width of the pulse to the period of the wave is usually called the duty cycle. We see thus that Raabe is considering a square wave of frequency ω 1 and duty cycle k / 2 π . His parameter k, the range of which is ( 0 , 2 π ) , corresponds to what he calls “the channel width”, “expressed in terms of phase”. The received signal will be the product of the square wave s ( t ) and the signal that needs to be transmitted, denoted by f ( t ) . For Raabe, the product r ( t ) = s ( t ) f ( t ) is “the modulated signal”, the square wave s ( t ) is “the unmodulated signal”, and the signal f ( t ) is “the modulating signal”. This terminology is of course borrowed from modulation theory. To obtain an amplitude modulated signal, one multiplies a carrier s ( t ) = sin ( ω t ) by some modulating signal f ( t ) , that is, one performs r ( t ) = s ( t ) f ( t ) . In other words, the amplitude of the sinusoid sin ( ω t ) is modulated according to the amplitude of f ( t ) . Raabe is using a square wave instead of the usual sinusoidal carrier; but the amplitude of this square wave is modulated by f ( t ) , as in the standard amplitude modulation scheme. His terminology is, in this sense, quite natural. Strictly speaking, the form of amplitude modulation expressed by r ( t ) = s ( t ) f ( t ) is best described as suppressed carrier amplitude modulation, whereas amplitude modulation in general would obey r ( t ) = s ( t ) [ α + β f ( t ) ] for some nonzero constants α and β . Note the term α s ( t ) , proportional to the carrier, which is absent in the case that we have been discussing. Raabe uses the word grenzmoduliert to refer to the suppressed carrier amplitude modulation scheme (see the footnote on p. 216 of his paper). To understand the effect of the modulating signal f ( t ) on the square wave s ( t ) , Raabe also expands f ( t ) in a Fourier series, and investigates the effect of the general term of this Fourier series on each frequency of the square wave. So the problem is reduced to that of understanding products of square waves and sinusoids, as in his Fig. A8. The result for a more general f ( t ) follows by superposition. The square wave had been decomposed in a Fourier series as well. And, as he writes ( … ) The modulation of a carrier representable as a Fourier series is equivalent to modulating each single frequency of the whole spectrum on its own. Raabe's next step is to assume that the signal to transmit, also called the modulating signal, is simply cos ( m ω 1 t ) , where m is a real number. Multiplication of this signal by the Fourier series of the square wave s ( t ) yields the received signal r ( t ) : (A) r ( t ) = k 2 π y m cos m ω 1 t + ∑ n = 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n 1 n π y m sin nk 2 [ cos ( n ‐ m ) ω 1 t + cos ( n + m ) ω 1 t ] . Raabe in fact multiplies by sin ( m ω 1 t + ψ ) , as shown in his equation (15), and after a few elementary manipulations reaches his equation (17). He later sets ψ = π / 2 to simplify the computations, and also because for the study of “energy-type distributions of the receiver spectrum” the phase angle ψ is of no real interest. He then reaches (A), which is essentially his equation (20). He notes that the received signal r ( t ) includes the transmitted signal, which has replaced the “direct voltage term”, namely k 2 π y m cos m ω 1 t . We will now consider the remaining terms, following Raabe's reasoning (check for example his Fig. A9). The frequencies appearing in r ( t ) are depicted in our Fig. 6 . Essentially, Raabe argues that to avoid ambiguity m has to satisfy m < 1 ‐ m , that is, m < 1 / 2 . In other words, the transmitted frequency must be below ω 1 / 2 , that is, one-half the sampling frequency. The condition guarantees that the spectral line marked m in the diagram (the one that replaced the “direct voltage term”) stays to the left of the “complementary frequency” 1 ‐ m , which in the context of amplitude modulation is called the “lower sideband of the first harmonic”. For signals consisting of a superposition of terms with different frequencies, the distortion can be avoided if all the frequencies are below one-half the sampling rate. This is how Raabe puts it: ( … ) the sampling frequency is determined by the range of signal frequencies. If these are kept below half of the sampling frequency, all of the noise frequencies above this limit can be kept away from the receiver by a low-pass filter. The transmission of a signal may thus be completely distortionless, if the sampling frequency is twice the highest signal frequency. The upper limitation of the signal frequencies is therefore a vital condition of distortionless transmission by time division multiplex transmission. This paragraph, also quoted by Lüke [3], summarises what has been called “Raabe's condition” (see Section 4 for further discussion). Note that the argument that lead Raabe to this statement was not merely qualitative, 10 10 Meijering (2002) writes [31, p. 325] “in more implicit verbal form, [the sampling theorem] had also been described in the German literature by Raabe”. Raabe's statement is a verbal summary of his findings for low-pass signals, but follows from the Fourier analysis of the sampled signal. but based on the analysis of the Fourier spectrum of the product of the modulating square wave and the signal. Raabe's conclusion has a legitimate mathematical basis, valid for the class of signals he considered. Note that Raabe regards the frequencies that appear above one-half of the sampling frequency as “noise frequencies”. Today, they would be called “aliasing terms”. Also recall that “distortionless transmission by time division multiplex” implies the recovery of each signal from its samples (or sections), in the sense previously discussed. At this point, it is worthwhile to look at some of the oscillograms obtained by Raabe [5, pp. 226–227], which are reproduced in Fig. 7 . They show the unmodulated signal (a square wave) and its product with three sinusoids of different frequencies. In case (b) the frequency of the sinusoid is less than one-half the frequency of the unmodulated signal ( 1 6 of that frequency, as can be found from the figure). The square wave also has a small duty cycle, so that the result resembles the acquisition of six samples per period of the sinusoid. The result in case (c) is very similar, but there is aliasing. The frequency of the sinusoid is above one-half the frequency of the unmodulated signal ( 5 6 of that frequency, as follows from the figure). This corresponds to the smallest alias frequency, the “lower sideband of the first harmonic”. In modern sampling terms, the frequency of the sinusoid in (b) is ω 0 , the sampling frequency (the frequency of the square wave) is ω s and ω 0 / ω s = 1 6 . The alias frequency in (c) would then be ω s ‐ ω 0 and of course ( ω s ‐ ω 0 ) / ω s = 5 6 as in Raabe's example (c). Raabe's oscillogram (d) illustrates the use of square waves of larger duty cycle, and how they retain segments of the signal that is multiplied by them. 3.3 Raabe's condition in the band-pass case Raabe realises that the reconstruction of the signal can be accomplished by a “low-pass filter”, but he does not stop here. He notes that sampling at “twice the highest signal frequency” is not always necessary, and that the sampling frequency can be decreased if the spectrum of the transmitted signal is of the band-pass type. Raabe states that “special conditions apply when the frequency range is limited to an octave”, in which case ( … ) one can lay down the sampling frequency onto the upper frequency limit, and the noise frequencies remain partly above the useful range, and partly, as in the case of the complementary frequency, below. The value “one octave” is of course correct. It follows from Fig. 6 (or Raabe's Fig. A9) that for the lower “noise frequency” 1 ‐ m to be below the transmitted frequency m, the following conditions must hold: 1 ‐ m > 0 , 1 ‐ m < m . This restricts the transmitted frequencies to the range implied by 1 2 < m < 1 , that is, the highest signal frequency must be below ω 1 and the lowest above ω 1 / 2 , meaning that the bandwidth of the signal should be limited to one octave. Raabe understands that “frequencies above the sampling frequency can also be transmitted free from distortion, but the relative range of frequencies shrinks more and more”. In fact, as it is well known today, the minimum sampling density is determined by the bandwidth of the signal and not necessarily by its highest frequency. The discussion would not be complete without mentioning the modifications that must be made to the recovery procedure in the band-pass case. Raabe writes that ( … ) one has to keep away from the receiver those noise frequencies lying outside of each section by a band pass filter. From his perspective of circuit design, the only change necessary is the replacement of the low-pass filter by a band-pass filter. 3.4 Admissible functions and generalised sampling Raabe's main mathematical tool is the Fourier series. The square wave needed by the multiplexing system is expanded in a Fourier series, the fundamental frequency of which is the sampling frequency. Similarly, the signal to be transmitted is also expanded in a Fourier series. The effect of the multiplication of the Fourier series is analysed, term by term, and the main results follow. Raabe's conclusions apply to signals that can be expressed as a linear combination of sinusoidal terms (or complex exponentials), the frequencies of which do not exceed one-half of the sampling frequency. The admissible functions include all band-limited periodic functions or trigonometric polynomials f ( t ) = ∑ k = ‐ M N c k e 2 π ikt / T but not band-limited square-integrable (finite-energy) signals, for example. However, for the purposes of using Raabe's time division multiplexing system this is not a restriction. The system would be able to handle signals of arbitrarily large but finite duration. 11 11 The sampling theorem with the sinc function for functions of finite duration was first established by the mathematician Ch. de la Vallée Poussin [32] in 1908; for a discussion of his contribution and its influence see [33]. The sampling expansion for trigonometric polynomials is in fact due to Euler, who discussed it more than once; so did Cauchy. See [34] for details about the method used by Euler to derive expansions such as cos vt = sin π t π 1 t + 2 t ∑ n = 1 ∞ cos vn ( ‐ 1 ) n t 2 ‐ n 2 , ( | v | ≤ π ) and other related historical information. Raabe's practical perspective is reflected in the way he deals with the reconstruction problem. After determining the aliasing terms, the reconstruction problem is essentially solved: The separation of the aliased terms or “noise frequencies” from the signal frequencies can be achieved by using a linear filter. The next step is the design of a low-pass or perhaps a band-pass filter and the matter is closed. His strong practical view may help to understand why he did not explicitly state a reconstruction formula based on the ideal low-pass filter, introduced by Küpfmüller and known as “Küpfmüller-Tiefpass” in the German literature. Instead of obtaining a theoretical reconstruction formula, for which he probably felt very little need, Raabe obtains a real reconstructed signal. In fact, it is worthwhile to discuss the connection between the system that Raabe built and generalised sampling. 12 12 Generalised sampling theory was developed at Aachen from 1977 onwards. It was first studied in the doctoral dissertation of Splettstößer [35], continued by Stens [36], Ries–Stens [37] and Butzer, Engels et al. [38]; overview papers are [39–41]. Let f ( t ) be one of the input signals. The corresponding sampled signal is obtained by multiplying f ( t ) by a square wave s ( t ) , which can be expressed as a sum of pulses p ( t ) . Hence, assuming for simplicity a unitary sampling period, we have f ( t ) s ( t ) = f ( t ) ∑ n p ( t ‐ n ) . Assume that the “channel width” is small, so that the square waves look like “line needles”. Then the sampled signal is approximately given by g ( t ) = ∑ n f ( n ) p ( t ‐ n ) . Consider now the lowpass filter implemented by Raabe. Let its response to a pulse p ( t ) be denoted by h ( t ) . The reconstructed signal obtained using Raabe's system can then be written as ∑ n f ( n ) h ( t ‐ n ) . There are two main differences to the classical sampling theorem: the sinc kernel, the Fourier transform of the ideal lowpass filter, 13 13 It is indeed surprising that Raabe nowhere in his thesis mentions the sinc function explicitly, which had been defined by his teacher Küpfmüller. However, it should be kept in mind that the ideal lowpass filter, and hence the sinc function, cannot be implemented. Therefore, it could not ever become part of the multiplexing system that Raabe was trying to design and build. sinc ( t ) ≔ sin π t π t , has been replaced by the function h ( t ) , the pulse response of the filter used in the implementation; and there are only finitely many samples f ( n ) . Both differences would necessarily occur in any practical realisation of sampling. The classical sampling theorem with the sinc kernel f ( t ) = ∑ n = ‐ ∞ ∞ f ( n ) sinc ( t ‐ n ) is not to be found explicitly in Raabe's paper. However, instead of multiplying f ( t ) = cos ( m ω 1 t ) , 0 < m < 1 / 2 , by the Fourier series expansion of the square wave in Raabe's Fig. A3, which leads to (A) or Raabe's equation (20), one could obtain a sampling theorem by multiplying f ( t ) by the sum of translated rect functions that describes the square wave itself, formally letting the pulse widths k / ω 1 decrease to zero to obtain the “line needles” mentioned by Raabe, and then low-pass filtering the result. The more general result in which f ( t ) is a linear combination of sines and cosines subject to the same frequency limitation would follow by superposition. Although these steps are not to be found explicitly in Raabe's paper, it is a reasonable inference that in view of Raabe's approach and results he was aware of more general results, but did not state anything in further generality because his interests were in more practical directions. Raabe might have felt little need for the sinc reconstruction formula because he could not implement it, nor did it describe the system he built. The formula would also fail to account for sources of error of which he was well aware and which he analyses. Examples are the effect of the rectangular pulses, and the distortions that they necessarily undergo when transmitted through a real line with nonzero resistance, capacitance and inductance as well as the crosstalk that occurs due to the “spreading-out” of the pulses from one channel into the adjacent channels, due to the nonideal transmission lines. Formula (A), which is Raabe's equation (20), is a more useful approximation to the behaviour of the system, as it expresses “the frequency spectrum of the modulated signal”, that is, the spectrum of the sampled signal. For example, at the end of Section 4, Raabe uses the second term of (A) to identify the effect of using “small channel widths k”, that is, pulses of small but finite duration: the attenuation by a factor of sin ( k / 2 ) / ( k / 2 ) , which as he notes approaches 1 as k approaches zero. 4 Raabe's condition and the Nyquist rate Raabe's condition relates distortionless transmission to the signal spectrum and sampling frequency, for both low-pass and band-pass spectra (cf. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and the translation in the Appendix). It is difficult to determine exactly how the notice of Raabe's work spread (or failed to spread) through the scientific community at the time, mainly in Germany and in the United States. This section is a start toward this, and provides background material that helps to understand Raabe's condition, its context and impact, and the connection with the so-called “Nyquist rate”. 4.1 Background on Raabe's condition In an interesting letter that he wrote to Lüke 14 14 Prof. Lüke carried on an extensive correspondence with Dr. Raabe from October 5, 1978, onwards. On October 10, 1989, he congratulated Raabe on the occasion of his 80th birthday and the publication of his thesis exactly 50 years before. He asked him for his vita and a photograph, which he published [2]. dated October 5, 1978, Raabe expresses his great pleasure in reading Lüke's article [1] on sampling. Raabe's dissertation had been discussed in this article with admiration; Lüke had stressed its practical aspects and the fact that it was independent of work in the same area by the Russian engineer Kotel’nikov 15 15 Vladimir Alexandrovich Kotel’nikov (1908–2005) was born on September 6, 1908, in Kazan, the capital of what was then the Republic of Tatarstan. He graduated from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MEI) in 1930. He became a postgraduate at MEI, and was promoted to senior laboratory assistant and then to assistant professor. His now famous manuscript [42] that contains the sampling theorem, prepared for a conference that was never held, was published in 1933 with the other contributions intended for the conference. It did not appear in an internationally accessible form until the publication in 2001 of an English translation [43, pp. 27–45]. His doctor of science thesis of 1946, translated in 1959 [44], is another of his pioneering works that drew little attention at the time it appeared despite the importance of the results it contained (see, in this respect, [45]). Kotel’nikov also worked in cryptography and planetary radar. He was elected a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1953, received the State Prize (twice, in 1943 and 1946), the Lenin prize (1964), the Eduard Rhein Foundation award (in 1999, at age 91, following a proposal made by Lüke), the IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal (2000) and several other honours. [42]. Raabe also mentions Koch's work [4]. He was very happy that Koch not only recalled to mind the term Raabsche Bedingung (Raabe's condition) but that this term continued to be used in the German electrical engineering terminology. Koch expressed regret that the term “Raabe's condition” was not used in the USA, and that elsewhere its influence was dying out. In this letter Raabe also recalled when he first heard of “Raabe's condition”; it was at a conference during World War II chaired by Prof. Hans Rukop (1883–1958) [16, pp. 148–150], Research Director of Telefunken at Berlin. Rukop, who had distributed many copies of Raabe's dissertation to the engineers of his research group, asked Raabe, who had not heard of the term, whether he was the creator of the “condition which gives the lowest sampling frequency for a given signal bandwidth” 16 16 This formulation of “Raabe's condition” is found in Raabe's letter of July 25, 1989, addressed to Prof. Hilberg, Darmstadt. ; Raabe affirmed it. Raabe also mentioned in this letter that in the USA there never was any reference to his article on the “sampling theorem”; in Radar articles it was credited to Shannon; in Sonar circles one spoke of the “Nyquist rate”. In his reply of October 30, 1978, Lüke mentioned that whereas he had so far found only one USA paper citing Raabe, namely the Bennett paper [6], in the German literature after World War II it was cited quite regularly (but he gives no specific references). People in the USA were astonished whenever Raabe mentioned his 1939 paper. 4.2 Shannon and the nyquist rate In his classical article of 1949, Shannon wrote [7, p. 448] that the sampling theorem (his Theorem 1) … had been given previously in other forms by mathematicians but in spite of its evident importance seems not to have appeared explicitly in the literature of communication theory. In a footnote attached to Nyquist's 17 17 Harry Nyquist was born on February 7 1889 in Nilsby, Sweden. He emigrated to America, attended the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, from 1912 to 1915, and received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1914 and 1915, respectively. He attended Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, from 1915 to 1917, and was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 1917. From 1917 to 1934 Nyquist was employed by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in the Department of Development and Research Transmission, where he was concerned with studies on telegraph picture and voice transmission. From 1934 to 1954 he was with the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., where he continued to work in communications engineering, especially in transmission engineering and systems engineering. When he retired he had obtained 138 US patents and published 12 technical articles. He received many honours for his outstanding work. He was the fourth person to receive the National Academy of Engineering Founder's Medal, “in recognition of his many fundamental contributions to engineering.” In 1960, he received the IRE Medal of Honor “for fundamental contributions to a quantitative understanding of thermal noise, data transmission and negative feedback.” Nyquist was also awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1960, and the Mervin J. Kelly award in 1961. He passed away on April 4, 1976. name, Shannon cites Nyquist's famous paper on telegraphy [46] and Bennett's paper on time division multiplex systems [6], which cites Raabe. We shall briefly discuss both works and the connection with Raabe's work and its impact. Nyquist's classical papers of 1924 and 1928 on telegraphy [47,46] show a thorough understanding of the connection between signalling speed, number of bits per symbol and bandwidth. Nyquist also fully understood intersymbol interference and how to avoid it. These are landmark achievements, for which he is justly remembered. However, an explicit formulation of the sampling theorem cannot be found in his works, and it would take some more time to appear in the engineering literature. Nyquist did establish that “the speed with which intelligence can be transmitted” increases linearly with the line speed or the number of symbols that can be transmitted per unit time, and linearly with log m or the number of bits per symbol; and his view of telegraphy is strikingly modern and contains key ideas underlying digital communication systems such as PCM, which would be discussed two decades later. PCM was the subject of the important paper of 1948 by Oliver, Pierce and Shannon [48]. The paper connected key concepts such as sampling, quantisation, coding and channel capacity. Its Appendix I contains a proof of the sampling theorem (along the lines given in [7]), but more importantly it described the essence of the problem in simple terms, which would appeal strongly to the engineering audience: To reconstruct the signal it is merely necessary to generate from each sample a proportional impulse, and to pass this regularly spaced series of impulses through an ideal low-pass filter of cutoff frequency W 0 . The output of this filter will then be (except for an overall time delay and possibly a constant of proportionality) identical to the input signal. Since the response of an ideal lowpass filter to an impulse is a sin x / x pulse, and since the total output is the linear sum of the responses to all inputs, this method of reconstruction is simply the physical embodiment of [the sampling theorem]. The masterful exposition of Oliver, Pierce and Shannon represents a synthesis of work that had its origin in Nyquist and the earlier precursors of telegraphy and culminated in Shannon's theory of communication. As the advantages of PCM started to be recognised, the importance of Nyquist's legacy became clear. Oliver, Pierce and Shannon wrote: If it surprises the reader to find that 2 W 0 T pieces of data will describe a continuous function completely over the interval T, it should be remembered that the 2 W 0 T coefficients of the sine and cosine terms of a Fourier series do just this, if, as we have assumed, the function contains no frequencies higher than W 0 . The approach of Nyquist (as that of Raabe) was of course firmly based on the analysis of the Fourier series of periodic signals, as these lines bring to mind. It is therefore not surprising what Shannon wrote when he discussed the sampling theorem in his article of 1949 [7]: Nyquist pointed out the fundamental importance of the time interval 1 / 2 W seconds in connection with telegraphy, and we will call this the Nyquist interval corresponding to the band. Shannon's “crisp statement and proof of the sampling theorem”, as Verdú put it [49, p. 2063], was instrumental in popularising sampling in the engineering mainstream, as was his reference to Nyquist. The expressions “Nyquist interval” or “Nyquist rate”, applied in reference to band-limited signals, the sampling theorem and PCM, very likely had their origin here, and spread rapidly as the enormous impact of Shannon's work began to be felt. 4.3 Bennett and Raabe Let us now return to Bennett's paper [6], also mentioned by Shannon, who writes that in it “a result similar to [the sampling theorem] is established, but on a steady-state basis.” And indeed the second section of [6], entitled “General Theory”, presents an approach to time-division multiplex systems. It is based on the Fourier series expansion of the waveform that represents the “switching process” (which occurs at what we would now call the sampling frequency). The action of the switching process on the input signal of the j th channel, E j ( t ) = E j e i ω j t , causes “upper and lower side frequencies from the signal on each harmonic of the switching frequency”—hence on each harmonic of the sampling frequency. After a comparison with amplitude modulation, Bennett goes on to consider the effect of a transmission line with a certain impedance and the rôle of the receiver. He reaches the conclusion that it is possible to separate the frequencies involved in the switching from that of the original signal, provided that ω j < q / 2 (his Eq. (11), p. 203), where q is the sampling frequency—the usual “Nyquist rate” condition. It is interesting to compare Bennett's and Raabe's work. Bennett's considers, unlike Raabe's, a general “switching function”; Raabe specifically considers the switching function in his Fig. A3 and its Fourier series expansion (see also our Section 3.2), but goes on to consider the band-pass case as well. Both Bennett and Raabe depend on the Fourier series, both consider periodic input signals, both compare the effects of switching with those of amplitude modulation, and both papers can be considered as containing sampling results on a “steady-state basis”, as Shannon wrote. Bennett does not refer directly to Raabe in his “General Theory” section, nor anywhere else in the paper. Raabe's paper is listed only at the end, included in a group of three “Further References”. Because the title of Raabe's paper is in German and no hints concerning its content are given, the relevance of Raabe's work for sampling or even time-division multiplex systems would not be clear at all to the readers of Bennett's paper. These reasons and the natural difficulty in obtaining copies of the work during the war certainly did not help to direct attention to Raabe's work immediately after its appearance (and before the appearance of Shannon's works of 1948 and 1949). 4.4 Raabe's work after 1948 After the war and the publication of Shannon's works [50,7] the theoretical contributions present in Raabe's work, written in German and published in a German journal, had even fewer chances of being noticed. Almost two decades after the publication of Raabe's paper, the 1958 dissertation of Schüssler [51] on the sampling theorem at RWTH Aachen does not refer to Raabe but explicitly only to Shannon (on p. 6 of the dissertation). For his calculations involving Fourier series, Schüssler cites the text books by Pöschl [52, p. 108], Hölzler-Holzwarth [53, pp. 98–114], Goldman [54, pp. 67–84] and the articles by Marko [55], Strecker [56,57], and Wheeler [58]. Schüssler was a student of Aschoff, just as was Lüke, whose historical works [1–4] brought attention to Raabe's work. It is interesting to observe that of the various works cited by Schüssler only the book by Hölzler 18 18 Erwin Hölzler (born on 1908), who became director of research and development at Siemens HG, also received his doctorate under Küpfmüller, but in 1941; he was also his co-worker. Thus he must have known Raabe. and Holzwarth [53] cites Raabe's dissertation. Perhaps Schüssler never checked the literature Hölzler-Holzwarth cites with respect to the sampling theorem and so missed Raabe's name there. On the other hand, the 1975 extended version of the book of Hölzler-Holzwarth, written among others by Kersten and Larsen [59,60], now cites Raabe's dissertation only in connection with delta modulation and DPCM 19 19 According to the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Oliver and Shannon are the inventors of PCM as described in “Communication System Employing Pulse Code Modulation” (US Patent 2,801,281, filed 1946 and 1952, granted 1956). However the British engineer Alec Reeves conceived the use of PCM for voice communication in 1937, and filed for a French patent. His US patent was granted in 1943. The Bell Labs people, who designed the SIGSALY vocoder encryption system for Allied communications during World War II, did not become aware of PCM binary coding as already proposed by A. Reeves until the middle of 1943. Going back further, the American inventor M.B. Farmer conceived telegraph time-division multiplexing (TDM) as early as 1853 (recall footnote 8), and the electrical engineer W.M. Miner used pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM), applying it to telephony, in 1903. Thus Raabe with his thesis of 1939 can also be ranked in this array. (Section 10.2) rather than sampling or time division multiplexing. In fact, it is the only work cited in their literature list in this connection. The references cited in [59] concerning sampling include Shannon [7], Whittaker [61] and Ferrar [62,63], but not Raabe. In his survey article [64] on system theory, Schüssler reports that one finds the sampling theorem [7,65], at least for periodic functions, already in the first edition of Küpfmüller's book [66] (published in 1949). According to Schüssler, Küpfmüller inaugurated (Linear) System Theory, and Shannon enlarged it substantially through his Information Theory [65]. In addition to works already mentioned, there is a variety of articles and several excellent books dealing with the broad areas of information, communication and linear systems theories and their development in which the early work of Karl Küpfmüller, as well as Nyquist, Whittaker, Kotel’nikov, etc. is cited in connection with sampling theory, but never the work of Raabe. Let us mention in the order of their appearance, the articles of Rice [67], Cherry [68], Pierce [69], Slepian [70], Viterbi [71], Aspray [72], Verdú [49], Lundheim [73] and Knudtzon [74]. There are also the doctoral dissertations of Hagemeyer [75] and Segal [76], and the internet article by Chiu et al. [77]. As an instance S. Verdú writes in the survey article [49, p. 2057]: K. Küpfmüller [4] (1924), H. Nyquist [5] (1928), and V. Kotel’nikov [6] (1933) studied the maximum telegraph signalling speed sustainable by bandlimited linear systems. Unbeknownst to those authors, E. Whittaker [7] (1915) and J. Whittaker [8] (1929) had found how to interpolate losslessly the sampled values of bandlimited functions. In footnote 23 [49, p. 2063], he writes In contrast to the 1920's papers by Nyquist and Küpfmüller (Section I), Shannon's crisp statement [1] and proof [150] of the sampling theorem were instrumental in popularizing this result in engineering. Thus there is indeed some justification for the term “Shannon sampling theorem” [151], [152]. In this respect, Pierce [69, p. 3] writes: In 1924 Nyquist [6] in the United States and Küpfmüller [7] in Germany showed that in order to transmit telegraph signals at a definite rate a certain definite bandwidth was required. As to books dealing with information theory and the sampling theorem, particularly those containing material on the history of the subject, one of the earliest seems to be the book by Hölzler and Holzwarth [53], already discussed, who refer to Raabe's dissertation [5] explicitly, and also mention Whittaker, Ferrar and an unpublished paper of J.R. Carson (of 1920, also cited by others), without explicit references. Hölzler and Holzwarth probably mean E.T. Whittaker's famous paper [61] of 1915 and Ferrar's article [62]. Then there is Reza's introduction to information theory, which includes the interpretation of the sampling theorem in terms of the response of an ideal low-pass filter to an impulse train [78, pp. 305,452]. Concerning the historical background of sampling, Reza writes: The concept of the sampling theorem has frequently been employed in communication problems such as the extensive work done at the Bell Telephone Laboratories on speech transmission and also by other investigators prior to Shannon, such as Nyquist, Küpfmüller, and Gabor. The mathematical statement of the sampling theorem has been made by E.T. Whittaker, J.M. Whittaker, and several other mathematicians. He adds that “subsequent to Shannon's use of the sampling theorem, a number of interesting articles on this subject have appeared in the literature of engineering as well as in mathematical journals”. He then refers to Fogel and Jagerman [79,80], Bond and Cahn [81], Linden and Abramson, Yen [82], Balakrishnan [83], Parzen, Kohlenberg [84], and van der Pol. He further adds [78, p. 454] that, according to Kolmogorov, the sampling theorem has also been “used in communication problems by the Russian scientist Kotel’nikov”, citing [42] (see our footnote 15). Cover and Thomas [85, p. 248] state: … sampling representation due to Nyquist (1924) and Shannon (1949) … Churkin, Jakoblew and Wunsch [86] and later Wunsch [87] refer to the sampling theorem as the “Abtasttheorem von Kotel’nikov” and its series as the “Kotel’nikov-Reihe”, but do not cite Kotel’nikov in their literature lists, 20 20 These three authors worked in Eastern Europe; they probably did not cite this paper as they never saw it. In fact, as late as 1995, Vladimir Tikhomirov, the great Russian expert in the broad areas of signal analysis and approximation, and a student of Kolmogorov, told one of the authors (P.L.B.) at Aachen that this paper was not available in Moscow; he himself had never seen it. However, Prof. Lüke had obtained a copy from friends in Moscow; Kotel’nikov's paper is also available in the British Library (at Boston Spa). this despite the fact that Kotel’nikov is the only name that they mentioned in regard to sampling. Curiously, their proof of the sampling theorem uses the contour integration technique for which Ogura [88] cited Lindelöf [89]; see Butzer et al. [90] and their references. However, such a proof is, surprisingly, not to be found in Kotel’nikov's paper [42]. 5 Conclusion There are convincing grounds for giving Raabe credit for discovering the minimum sampling rate for distortionless transmission, independently of Kotel’nikov. He sought a condition to prevent interference in a multiplexing system, and found from the analysis of the system that in the low-pass case the transmitted frequencies must be less than one-half the sampling frequency. He also gave, for the first time, the condition for the band-pass case. It turns out that his conclusions hold in more general contexts, but he formulated them in this setting, one decade before Shannon named the condition after Nyquist, and deserves credit for that. Why was the impact of Raabe's work not more widely felt? In this article we have suggested several reasons. His thesis, written in German and published in a German journal, appeared just before World War II, a period unfavourable to the quick dissemination of knowledge. During the war Raabe worked on radar, and after it he moved to the USA where he began working in other areas. By that time Shannon's work had appeared in the USA and its enormous impact was being felt. In engineering circles, the sampling theorem became firmly associated with Shannon (and Nyquist, see Section 4), although Shannon himself clearly acknowledged that sampling was “common knowledge in the communication art” [50] and cited Bennett [6], who in turn cited Raabe. However, for the reasons explained in Section 4, this was unlikely to attract attention to Raabe's work. Even in Germany, the contributions of Küpfmüller seem to have been more widely known than those of Raabe, a former student at his Chair in TH Berlin. Schüssler's doctoral dissertation of 1958 on the sampling theorem at RWTH Aachen [51] does not mention Raabe. Although Schüssler and Lüke had both been students of the same supervisor (V. Aschoff), it was Lüke [2,3]) who drew attention to Raabe's work; but that was more than 40 years later. Finally, it must be noted that Raabe's thesis contained not only the theory outlined in Section 3, but also additional material, such as circuit diagrams and pictures of the signals, all related to his main goal, the implementation of the multiplexing system. The term “sampling” is not mentioned in the title (nor in the title of Bennett's paper), and the relevance of the work to sampling theory is not immediately obvious. It is quite possible that the theoretical analysis underlying the multiplexing system was overlooked by readers potentially interested in it. As the implementation of the multiplexing system grew obsolete, the chances of someone noting the theoretical contributions became even smaller. By the time Shannon stated and proved the sampling theorem a number of mathematicians and engineers had contributed to sampling. Raabe's work possesses, however, one characteristic that distinguishes it from all others: at a time when the principles underlying sampling and multiplexing were still unclear and in the process of being developed, he managed not only to grasp the essentials of the problem, but to build and test a system that carried the idea to practice. The engineering aspects of his work and its strong practical perspective are indeed outstanding.

The authors also want to express their sincere thanks to the three expert referees and editor for their careful study of the manuscript, their many concrete remarks and excellent suggestions; they have been incorporated into the manuscript. In order to show that Raabe really managed to build a system that carried out his ideas to practice, one referee suggested that the oscillograms in Figures 29–33 of Raabe's dissertation [5, pp. 226–227] be reproduced in our text. They are given in Fig. 7 with the necessary explanations. Appendix A A translation of Raabe's “Untersuchungen an der wechselzeitigen Mehrfachübertragung (Multiplexübertragung)” Note. This translation corresponds to the first and most of the second part of Raabe's doctoral thesis [5], which extends through 15 pages in two columns. The parts that deal with the implementation details and circuit analysis have not been included. We have also omitted the sections of the second part that deal with problems such as crosstalk, which are of interest from the point of view of the multiplexing system but are not crucial for those interested in the sampling problem. Our overriding concern in this translation is to get across in English what Raabe wrote in German. A.1 Introduction By definition, time division multiplexing is the transmission of several signals on a transmission line, whereby periodically successive short term sections from the signals are connected to the transmission line, as depicted in Fig. A1 . At the transmitter end the signals of the transmitters S 1 , S 2 , … will be switched over a distributor, V s , to the transmission line L. At the other end of the line another distributor, V e , which rotates synchronously with the distributor V s , connects the signals to the different receivers E 1 , E 2 , … . The purpose of this process is a better utilisation of the transmission line. The connection of a transmitter with its accompanying receiver is termed a channel. A transmission system operates therefore with as many channels as connections can be established through the transmission line. The “channel width” is the duration of a connection between a transmitter and its accompanying receiver within one switching period of the multiplex-transmission, expressed in terms of phase. Over and again many inventors have been involved in the development and improvement of the time division multiplex-transmission, but so far a practical realisation in telephony remains unknown. On the other hand theoretical dissertations which deal in detail with the transmission problem are so far unknown. Therefore the goal of this paper is to fill this gap as well as to develop a test installation by which the theoretical result could be verified. One distinguishes between two different systems of time division multiplex transmission. 1. The Baudot system. The function to transmit over one channel must be constrained to fit within the time interval alloted to the channel. If that is the case, the transmitted signal reaches the receiver undistorted. The application of the Baudot system is limited by the need to employ symbols of equal duration, repeated periodically. The system has the advantage of allowing the line to be used to its full potential, despite the speed limitations imposed by manual operation of the telegraphy keys. 2. The Delany system. Except for a restriction concerning its highest frequency, the function to transmit is arbitrary. As a result, the system would be able to deal with telegraphy or telephony signals. However, the segments of the transmitted function that fall outside the alloted time intervals will not be transmitted. The received signal will therefore differ from the transmitted one. The system of Delany is intended for telegraphy only; the idea of extending it to telephony is basically not new, but it requires a totally different technical setup. The present paper deals exclusively with the Delany system. A.2 Theory A.2.1 The mathematical formulation of the distortions The function depicted in Fig. A2 (a) shall be transmitted in the time division multiplex transmission mode. The connection will be established via the distributors with period τ 1 for the duration of the channel width k / ω 1 , according to Fig. A2(b), such that the received function y e ( t ) proceeds as depicted in Fig. A2(c). The transmitted function is representable in the form (1) y s ( t ) = y 0 + ∑ y i sin ( ω i t + ψ i ) , 0 < ω i < ω g , (1a) y s ( t ) = y 0 + M ( t ) . Here y s ( t ) describes the voltage, where y 0 is a direct voltage and M ( t ) = ∑ y i sin ( ω i t + ψ i ) is the sum of all existing alternating voltages with amplitude y i , angular frequency ω i and zero-phase angle ψ i , where ω i shall remain below a limit ω g . This expression represents the actual transmitted function and subsequently will be called “modulating function”. The received function can be put in the form (2) y e ( t ) = ay 0 + b ∑ y i sin ( ω i t + ψ i ) + ∑ y z sin ( ω z t + ψ z ) , (2a) y e ( t ) = ay 0 + bM ( t ) + V ( t ) . If now y e ( t ) is regarded as a voltage, the constant a represents the attenuation factor of the direct voltage element, whereas the constant b is the attenuation factor of the modulating function. Since one cannot expect that the attenuation of the modulating oscillations is frequency independent, one has to expect the occurrence of modulating oscillations in the expression ∑ y z sin ( ω z t + ψ z ) , which also includes all other distortions. In this way, the normally used terms of linear and non-linear distortions have been replaced by a more general concept. A.2.2 The frequency spectrum of the unmodulated channel In order to obtain an idea by which laws the distortion spectrum will be formed, in a first approach the modulating function will be neglected, in such a way that the received function will proceed as depicted in Fig. A3 . The function is periodic and so expandable in a Fourier series. That is (3) y e ( t ) = k 2 π y m + ∑ 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n 2 n π y m sin nk 2 cos n ω 1 t . One recognises that the direct voltage term will be transmitted with the attenuation a = k / 2 π . Next to it all harmonics of the sampling frequency appear, where n is the ordinal number of the harmonics. The diagram in Fig. A4 in which the amplitudes of the harmonics are plotted against n illustrate this clearly. For this purpose the series function is divided into a few elementary functions: (3a) y e ( t ) = K + ∑ 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n ABC ; (3b) K = k 2 π y m , (3c) A = 2 n π y m , (3d) B = sin nk 2 , (3e) C = cos n ω 1 t . At the peak values one has cos n ω 1 t = 1 . The expression ( ‐ 1 ) n implies that the even and odd numbered harmonics have different signs. If n is assumed to be a continuous variable, the peak values of the harmonics will be (3f) Y 1 =+ AB for the even harmonics , (3g) Y 2 = ‐ AB for the odd harmonics . These equations imply that the amplitudes of the harmonics decrease according to the hyperbola A, where at the same time they oscillate according to the periodic function B. The largest values of the amplitudes are given by A. Example For constructing the diagram below the following values have been assumed: k = 1.3 , y m = π . Fig. A4 depicts the peak values of the harmonics with their determining functions A, B, Y 1 and Y 2 . The function A is only determined by y m , but not by k. The function B is only determined by k. One finds the relation when for instance one puts n = n p for the period length of B. Then the argument of the function becomes nk / 2 = n p k / 2 = 2 π and thus (4) k = 4 π / n p . Writing (4a) k / 2 π = 2 / n p , one gets a clear feeling of the quantity k, namely, the ratio of the contact width k and the sampling period 2 π is equal to the ratio of the fixed section n = 2 and the period length n p of function B. From this it can be concluded that the period length n p is in inverse proportion to the contact width k. By letting k / 2 π become smaller and smaller, the first peak value of B and by that the upper limit A will be reached for higher harmonics. Consequently, the distortion factor of the basic wave increases. The functions Y 1 and Y 2 have undetermined values at n = 0 . These can be defined by the limits for n → 0 according to the rule of Bernoulli–L’Hospital. One gets (5) Y 10 =+ y m k π , Y 20 = ‐ y m k π . A.2.3 The distortions of a modulating oscillation in the frequency range below the sampling frequency Since the unmodulated channel in its frequency spectrum has no oscillations below the sampling frequency, it is natural to speculate that this range is suited for the modulating oscillations. However, after the transmission, misinterpretations are possible, as is shown in Fig. A5 . Here for reasons of simplicity the contact width k is assumed to be small, so that switching pulses only appear as line needles. They follow with period τ v . As the transmitter function (Fig. A5(a)) a sinusoidal alternating voltage has been assumed so that τ m > τ v holds according to the assumption. The switching pulses then transmit voltages, which correspond to the respective momentary values of the transmitter function. One, then, detects that the received function has to show a low frequency beat 21 21 Raabe uses the expression niederfrequente Schwebung aufweist. with period τ s . At the receiving end one would infer a transmitter function of the form depicted in Fig. A5(b). The beat frequency f s is derivable from the following relations. According to Fig. A5(a) one has (6) τ s = n τ m , (7) τ s = ( 2 n + 1 ) τ v . By substituting n from Eq. (7) for n from Eq. (6) and solving for τ s one obtains (8) τ s = τ v 1 ‐ 2 τ v τ m . Introducing the frequencies f that correspond to the periods τ , one gets for the beat frequency (9) f s = f v ‐ 2 f m . A beat frequency develops when two periodic functions of different frequencies are added. The two oscillations fulfilling this condition are depicted in Fig. A5(c). From this one detects that next to the frequency of the transmitter function a corresponding frequency f k appears in the receiving function, which can be derived through the following relations. From Fig. A5(c) one gathers (10) τ s = ( n + 1 ) τ k . Introducing n from Eq. (19) into Eq. (6) and solving for τ s , it follows that (11) τ s = τ k 1 ‐ τ k τ m . Eq. (11) together with Eq. (8) yield (12) τ k = τ v 1 ‐ τ v τ m . After introducing frequencies one finally obtains (13) f k = f v ‐ f m . The result shows that for each frequency in the transmitter function there corresponds a frequency, complementary with respect to the sampling frequency, the amplitude of which—under the restriction of small contact width—is equal to the amplitude of the original transmitted frequency. The relations between these frequencies are illustrated in Fig. A6 . A special peculiarity shows in the particular case f m = f v / 2 , for which f k = f m results. Here interference phenomena appear, which depend on the phase position, where in the limit case the original oscillation will be transmitted either with double amplitude or not, according to whether the sampling pulses are in phase with the peak values or in phase with the zero-passages of the original frequency. Since in Fig. A5, as proof of the relations, an especially instructive example has been chosen, now as a confirmation of the theory, the relations at a very low transmitter frequency will be demonstrated. Fig. A7 (a) displays the transmitter function and the receiver function directed by it. In Fig. A7(b) the transmitter function with half the amplitude is plotted together with the corresponding complementary frequency. Fig. A7(c) finally shows how the sum function, built up by both frequencies, agrees with the receiver function as well. A.2.4 The frequency spectrum of the modulated channel The frequency spectrum of the unmodulated channel has been determined by Fourier analysis. Multiplying the receiver function of the unmodulated channel, as defined by Eq. (3) and displayed in Fig. A8 (a), one obtains the function displayed in Fig. A8(b) (14) f ( t ) = sin ( m ω 1 t + ψ ) , the equation of the modulated channel, as displayed in Fig. A8(c): (15) y e ( t ) = k 2 π y m sin ( m ω 1 t + ψ ) + ∑ 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n 2 n π y m sin nk 2 cos n ω 1 t sin ( m ω 1 t + ψ ) . The receiver function underlying the transmitter function reads (16) y s ( t ) = y m sin ( m ω 1 t + ψ ) . Eq. (15) has now to be transformed so that only elementary frequency terms in form of a sum appear. One finally gets (17) y e ( t ) = k 2 π y m ( sin ψ cos m ω 1 t + cos ψ sin m ω 1 t ) + ∑ 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n 1 n π y m sin nk 2 [ sin ψ ( cos ( n ‐ m ) ω 1 t + cos ( n + m ) ω 1 t ) ‐ cos ψ ( sin ( n ‐ m ) ω 1 t ‐ sin ( n + m ) ω 1 t ) ] . In this equation all frequencies appear twice, represented, respectively, in a cosine term and in a sine term. The amplitude of each single term is determined by the zero-phase angle, as the following general term demonstrates: (18) y ( ω i t ) = A i ( cos ψ sin ω i t ± sin ψ cos ω i t ) . The expression is always derivable in the form (19) y ( ω i t ) = B i sin ( ω i t + ψ ) . Now one can easily prove that A i = B i , and therefore the amplitude of the signal oscillations is independent of the phase-position of the modulating oscillation. For all further investigations for which only the energy-type distribution of the receiver spectrum is of interest, Eq. (17) can be considerably simplified, if for instance one puts ψ = π / 2 . Then there results (20) y e ( t ) = k 2 π y m cos m ω 1 t + ∑ 1 ∞ ( ‐ 1 ) n 1 n π y m sin nk 2 [ cos ( n ‐ m ) ω 1 t + cos ( n + m ) ω 1 t ] . Concerning this equation the following can be said. If one chooses the modulation frequency below the sampling frequency, i.e. 0 < m < 1 , then there will be no direct current term. The modulation frequency is represented by the term (21) bM = k 2 π y m sin m ω 1 t from which the attenuation (22) b = k 2 π is deduced. Comparing Eq. (20) with Eq. (3) for the unmodulated channel one recognises that the modulating frequency has replaced the direct voltage term, for which a = b holds. The harmonic frequencies ω 1 t , 2 ω 1 t , 3 ω 1 t … do not exist in the modulated 22 22 Raabe uses the expression Grenzmodulation, by which he means a suppressed-carrier amplitude modulation scheme (see the footnote on page 216 of his paper). channel. In their places, the pairs of frequencies ω 1 t ± m ω 1 t , 2 ω 1 t ± m ω 1 t , 3 ω 1 t ± m ω 1 t … appear, where at the same time a bisection of the amplitudes has happened. A vivid description of the result is given in a frequency diagram. Example For the construction of the graph the diagram in Section 2 is taken as a basis. Additionally, the following value has been assumed: m = 0.2 . The frequency diagram is plotted in Fig. A9 (compare also Fig. A4). It shows that the modulation of a carrier representable as a Fourier series is equivalent to modulating each single frequency of the whole spectrum on its own. It is in the nature of the approach that the single frequencies themselves will not be transmitted as carriers, since no constant term is related to the modulating frequency term. With regard to the properties of most modulation circuits, if one would describe this general case, then the transmitter function would be characterised as (23) y s ( t ) = y 0 + y m sin m ω 1 t . The receiver function would consequently consist of an unmodulated part according to Eq. (3) and a modulated part according to Eq. (20). For this a modulation degree is also definable (24) k m = y m y 0 . According to this definition, introduced in high-frequency engineering for single undulating carriers, the modulation degree is defined as the ratio of the peak-values of the modulation voltage and the carrier alternate voltage. In the frequency spectrum, the side band frequencies appear next to the carrier frequency, with half the amplitude of the modulating voltage. Determining the modulation degree for a single oscillation of the spectrum in the sense of the definition used in high-frequency engineering, one obtains again the expression in Eq. (24). The modulation degree is thus independent of the ordinal number of the harmonics. The corresponding frequency shown in Section 3 in the range below the sampling frequency hereafter turns out to be the lower side band frequency of the first harmonic. It is characterised by the second term of the series function according to Eq. (20). Its amplitude differs from the transmitted original frequency by the factor sin ( k / 2 ) / ( k / 2 ) . For small channel widths k, this factor will approximately take the value 1, in accordance with the theory deduced in Section 3. A.2.5 The ranges of transmission and the selection of the sampling frequency For the demonstrated conditions of transmission the sampling frequency is determined by the range of signal frequencies. If these are kept below half of the sampling frequency, all of the noise frequencies above this limit can be kept away from the receiver by a low-pass filter. The transmission of a signal may thus be completely distortionless, if the sampling frequency is twice the highest signal frequency. The upper limitation of the signal frequencies is therefore a vital condition of distortionless transmission by time division multiplex transmission. Special conditions apply when the frequency range of a signal is limited to an octave. Then one can lay down the sampling frequency onto the upper frequency limit, and the noise frequencies remain partly above the useful range, and partly, as in the case of complementary frequency, below. Theoretically, frequencies above the sampling frequency can also be transmitted free from distortion, but the relative range of frequencies shrinks more and more. Fig. A10 conveys a general overview. There all frequencies of the receiver function are displayed as functions of the frequency of the modulating oscillation. One recognises that all sections between the points 0 , 1 , 2 … can be covered by the modulation frequency; one only has to keep away from the receiver those noise frequencies lying outside of each section by a band pass filter.

Even the inverse of a Toeplitz can be computed in O(n 2 ) flops, using the Trench method [1]. Many variants of these methods have been introduced [2], including a number of methods that can handle Toeplitz matrices with singular submatrices [3,4]. Eﬃcient algorithms suited for rationally generated matrices have also been given [5,6]. Quadratic inversion formulas for matrices “close” to Toeplitz have been given [7,8]. A more general approach, described in [9], has lead to O(n 2 ) algorithms for a class of matrices with recursive structure. This includes Toeplitz, Hankel and other matrices. Block–Toeplitz matrices with Toeplitz entries are also studied in [10]. The fast solver proposed in [11], based on a modified QR algorithm, is backward stable and can be applied to a class of nonsymmetric Toeplitz-like matrices. It also explores displacement structure (see [12] for a review). There are also O(nlog 2 n) methods. The one in [13] applies to matrices of low displacement rank, the method in [14] is based on Padé approximation, and Ref. [15] uses a generalized Schur algorithm and applies to real positive definite Toeplitz ✩ Some of the results contained in this work were presented at the 109th Annual Meeting of the American Mathematical Society, Baltimore, MD, January 2003, and in the SampTA-03, Strobl, Austria, May 2003. * Corresponding author.

Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 matrices. The method described in [16] uses real trigonometric transformations and solves symmetric Toeplitz equations with complexity O(nlog 2 n). Iterative approaches based on Newton’s method [17,18] have also been reported. Hermitian positive definite Toeplitz equations can be solved using the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method [19,20], implementing the matrix-vector products using the FFT. Adequate preconditioning [21–26] may lead to O(nlogn) performance. This paper introduces a new idea for solving linear equations: the idea of embedding the original matrix in a larger but more structured matrix. The size of the problem increases, but the more regular structure may allow a net performance gain. We test the concept on Toeplitz equations, and show that the embedding of the Toeplitz matrix in a circulant leads to an eﬃcient and extremely simple iterative algorithm, that can under certain conditions compete with PCG. In Section 2 we recall some theoretical facts regarding circulant and Toeplitz matrices, that will be used in the rest of the paper. The proposed method is described in Section 3, and its convergence is analyzed in Section 4. Section 5 is concerned with the very important problem of positive definite Toeplitz systems. For these matrices, we provide several theorems which justify the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, some experimental results are shown. Although the usefulness of the proposed iteration is limited in the case of ill-conditioned matrices, we believe that the results show that the problem size/problem structure trade-off has potential, and deserves further study. 2. Preliminaries Let us recall some results about Toeplitz and circulant matrices. If C is a circulant matrix of order 2n, it is known that its eigenvalues are {λ i (C)} 0lessorequalslanti<2n , where λ i (C) is the ith element of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the first row of C. On one hand, C can be written as C = bracketleftbigg TS ST bracketrightbigg where T, S are Toeplitz matrices. Note that T + S is a circulant, and T − S is skew-circulant. By expressing the DFT of length 2n as two DFTs of length n, it is shown in [27] that the eigenvalues of T + S are {λ 2i (C)} 0lessorequalslanti<n , and those of T − S are {λ 2i+1 (C)} 0lessorequalslanti<n . On the other hand, we can also write C = 1 2 bracketleftbigg II I −I bracketrightbiggbracketleftbigg T + S 0 0 T − S bracketrightbiggbracketleftbigg II I −I bracketrightbigg (1) so C is invertible if and only if T ± S are nonsingular. In that case, C −1 is equal to 1 2 bracketleftbigg II I −I bracketrightbiggbracketleftbigg (T + S) −1 0 0 (T − S) −1 bracketrightbiggbracketleftbigg II I −I bracketrightbigg (2) which is also a circulant matrix. Hence, multiplications by C or C −1 are computed as circular convolutions, which can be eﬃciently implemented using the FFT algorithm. For real symmetric matrices C, note that C is positive definite if and only if the real symmetric Toeplitz matrices T ± S are positive definite. 3. The method Consider the Toeplitz problem Tx= y, where T isarealnonsingularn ×n Toeplitz matrix with elements T ij = t i−j .Itis easy to realize that T can be embedded (as a principal submatrix) in a circulant matrix of size 2n − 1orgreater.Wewill often consider circulants of size 2n, but larger sizes have practical and possibly theoretical advantages (the smallest power of two greater than 2n −1 is often a good size to use in practice, as FFTs of powers of two are especially eﬃcient). To build the circulant, define a Toeplitz matrix S,withelementsS ij = s i−j determined by s i = t i−n ,fori > 0, and s i = t i+n ,fori < 0. The element α = s 0 is arbitrary. Then, C = bracketleftbigg TS ST bracketrightbigg is a circulant of size 2n. In any case, the Toeplitz linear system can now be replaced with a circulant problem: C bracketleftbigg x 0 bracketrightbigg = bracketleftbigg TS ST bracketrightbiggbracketleftbigg x 0 bracketrightbigg = bracketleftbigg y z bracketrightbigg where y = Txand z = Sx. The circulant equations Ca= b,with a = bracketleftbigg x bracketrightbigg , b = bracketleftbigg y bracketrightbigg 0 z P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 1713 are equivalent to Tx= y. Note the difference between this formulation and the usual one: the left-hand side vector of a traditionally written set of linear equations Tx= y contains all the unknown quantities, whereas in our formulation there are unknown elements in both the right-hand and left-hand side vectors. We may say that both a and b are partially known, since x and z are unknown. The proposed algorithm produces two sequences a k and b k which iteratively approximate a and b, respectively. At each step, the known elements of a and b are reinserted in the approximations, and multiplication by C or C −1 leads to the next approximation. More precisely, let a k = bracketleftbigg x k o k bracketrightbigg , b k = bracketleftbigg y k z k bracketrightbigg (3) be the approximations to a and b, and hence to the unknowns x and z, available at the end of step k.Stepk + 1isdefined by the following sequence of operations: (1) Insert the known elements of b into b k ,thatis,replacey k by y and compute the matrix-vector product: C −1 bracketleftbigg y z k bracketrightbigg = bracketleftbigg x k+1 o k+1 bracketrightbigg = a k+1 . (4) (2) Insert the known elements of a into a k+1 ,thatis,replaceo k+1 by the zero vector, and compute the matrix-vector product: C bracketleftbigg x k+1 0 bracketrightbigg = bracketleftbigg y k+1 z k+1 bracketrightbigg = b k+1 . (5) (3) Stop if the result is acceptable. Otherwise repeat. The matrix-vector products are 2n-dimensional circular convolutions that can be performed in O(nlogn) flops using standard FFT or fast convolution algorithms. The FFT of the first column of C needs to be computed only once, and imme- diately determines the FFT of the first column of C −1 . Both steps (1) and (2) of the algorithm require one FFT and one IFFT of (at least) 2n points, and hence O(nlogn) flops. More specific speedups are possible but will not be discussed for brevity (for example, it is well known that the bit-reversal stages can be avoided by properly selecting the FFT and IFFT algorithms, and that the FFT of 2n real data can be computed using one n-point complex FFT). It is interesting to compare our work and [23,22], which explore preconditioning by embedding. These are based on equations similar to bracketleftbigg TS ST bracketrightbiggbracketleftbigg x x bracketrightbigg = bracketleftbigg y y bracketrightbigg of size m = 2n. They are not equivalent to Tx= y but to (T + S)x = b, and lead to the (circulant) preconditioner T + S.This is the same as our T + S when the size of the embedding is m = 2n. Another (skew-circulant) preconditioner obtained by embedding is T − S (note its appearance in (1)). It is important to note that the our approach can in principle be tried even when T is not Toeplitz, provided that it can be embedded as a principal submatrix in a circulant of suﬃciently small size. Note that principal submatrices of Toeplitz or circulant matrices are not necessarily Toeplitz. For example, ⎡ ⎣ abd dac bca ⎤ ⎦ is not Toeplitz, but it can be embedded as a principal submatrix in the circulant ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ abc d dab c cdab bcd a ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ (note the row and column that must be added, in bold). For an example of a problem that leads to such non-Toeplitz matrices see [28,29]. In fact, the circulant matrices considered in [28] have one interesting property: they have k zero eigenvalues, but every principal submatrix obtained by deleting at least k of its rows and columns is nonsingular. Since the proposed method only works if C is invertible, this suggests the following question: is it always possible to embed T in a nonsingular circulant, by the described process? The following result shows that this is possible. We denote by C 0 the circulant embedding matrix obtained by choosing α = 0. 1714 P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 Theorem 1. A Toeplitz matrix T can always be embedded in an infinite set of nonsingular circulant matrices C: the ones obtained by choosing α /∈ braceleftbig −λ 2i (C 0 ), λ 2i+1 (C 0 ), 0lessorequalslanti < n bracerightbig . Proof. Given T, let us build as explained C 0 and S 0 such that α = s 0 = 0. Hence, any other matrix S of that kind is S = S 0 +αI.Hence,T ± S = T ±(S 0 +αI).Now,C is invertible if and only if its eigenvalues are nonzero, but its eigenvalues are those of T + S 0 + αI (say, λ 2i (C 0 ) + α), and those of T − S 0 − αI (say, λ 2i+1 (C 0 ) − α). It suﬃces to impose that these 2n numbers are not zero. a50 4. Analysis of the algorithm This section discusses the convergence of the algorithm, in the general case of invertible matrices T.Thefirsttheorem provides a necessary and suﬃcient condition for convergence. Theorem 2. If C is invertible, (T + S) −1 exists, and the algorithm converges if and only if the eigenvalues λ of A = (T + S) −1 (T − S) lie in the subset of the complex plane described by 4cosθ −2 √ 2 < |λ +1| < 4cosθ +2 √ 2 (6) where θ denotes the polar angle of λ,centeredinλ =−1. The complex domain defined by (6) is named Pascal’s snail, and is depicted in Fig. 1. Proof. It follows from (3), (4) and (5) that a k+1 = C −1 QCPa k + C −1 bracketleftbigg y 0 bracketrightbigg where P = bracketleftbigg I 0 00 bracketrightbigg , Q = I − P. It will be convenient to set C −1 = bracketleftbigg C 1 C 2 C 2 C 1 bracketrightbigg . (7) A brief computation now shows that C −1 QCP= bracketleftbigg C 2 S 0 C 1 S 0 bracketrightbigg , and therefore x k converges if and only if the spectral radius of C 2 S satisfies ρ(C 2 S)<1. To determine C 2 ,itsuﬃcesto compare Eqs. (7) and (2), and a straightforward computation shows that C 2 = 1 2 bracketleftbig (T + S) −1 − (T − S) −1 bracketrightbig . The product C 2 S can now be written as C 2 S = 1 4 bracketleftbig (T + S) −1 − (T − S) −1 bracketrightbigbracketleftbig (T + S) − (T − S) bracketrightbig = 1 4 parenleftbig 2I − A − A −1 parenrightbig , with A = (T + S) −1 (T − S). Any eigenvalue λ of A–they are not zero–corresponds to an eigenvalue f (λ) of the iteration matrix, with f (λ) = 1 4 parenleftbig 2− λ − λ −1 parenrightbig , and so the algorithm converges if and only if | f (λ)| < 1. To finish, we find the set of complex numbers λ such that P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E.

The iteration matrix is C 2 S = (2I − A − A −1 )/4, not A. The theorem assures the possibility of studying the eigen- values of the simpler matrix A, for convergence purposes. 5. Analysis for positive definite matrices In many practical problems T is a positive definite Toeplitz matrix, that is, x ∗ Tx> 0 for all nonzero complex vectors x, a condition that implies that T is Hermitian [30]. In this case, the first question that arises is whether T can embedded in a circulant positive definite matrix C. To this aim, let us recall the circulant matrix C 0 ;wewilldenote L 0 = min 0lessorequalslanti<n λ 2i (C 0 ), L 2n−2 = max 0lessorequalslanti<n λ 2i (C 0 ), L 1 = min 0lessorequalslanti<n λ 2i+1 (C 0 ), L 2n−1 = max 0lessorequalslanti<n λ 2i+1 (C 0 ) (8) which correspond to the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of T + S 0 and T − S 0 , respectively. Note that they are easily computed by means of a 2n-point FFT of the first row of C 0 , and that this FFT has to be computed for the purpose of eﬃciently implementing the circular convolutions required by the algorithm. Therefore, assuming that these four quantities are known implies negligible computational overhead. We first provide the theorem of existence in the positive definite case, analogous to Theorem 1 in the general case: Theorem 3. A real positive definite Toeplitz matrix T can be embedded in a real positive definite circulant matrix C by the described process if and only if L 0 + L 1 > 0. Moreover, C is positive definite if and only if α is chosen in the interval α ∈ (−L 0 , L 1 ). (9) Proof. Recalling the preliminaries and the proof of Theorem 1, we now impose that the eigenvalues of T ± S = T ±(S 0 +αI) be positive. But the eigenvalues of T + S 0 + αI are λ 2i (C 0 ) + α, and those of T − S 0 − αI are λ 2i+1 (C 0 ) − α.Itsuﬃcesto impose that these 2n numbers be positive. As C 0 is real and symmetric, its eigenvalues λ i (C 0 ) are real; so we just choose −λ 2i (C 0 )<α <λ 2k+1 (C 0 ), 0lessorequalslanti,k < n, or, in an equivalent way, − min 0lessorequalslanti<n λ 2i (C 0 ) =−L 0 < α < min 0lessorequalslantk<n λ 2k+1 (C 0 ) = L 1 which concludes the proof. a50 Next, we apply the general convergence theorem to the particular case of positive definite matrices: Theorem 4. If T is a positive definite Toeplitz matrix and α ∈ (−L 0 , L 1 ), then the eigenvalues of A = (T + S) −1 (T − S) are positive. √ √ In this case, the algorithm converges if and only if they belong to the interval (1/c,c),wherec= 3+2 2(hence, 1/c = 3−2 2). 1716 P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 Fig. 1. The curve | f (z)|=1 in the complex plane, and the graph of | f (z)| for real z (as in Theorem 4, c = 3+2 √ 2). Proof. The previous theorem guarantees that C is positive definite; hence, it follows from (1) that both T + S and T − S are also positive definite matrices, and so is (T + S) −1 . We can therefore write (T + S) −1 = XX H , and hence A = XX H (T − S) = XX H (T − S)XX −1 . This shows that A is similar to B = X H (T − S)X (henceforth, they share eigenvalues). Moreover, B is congruent to T − S,butT − S is also positive definite, and so is B;thus,A has positive eigenvalues. Now let us impose the convergence condition (6) to the eigenvalues λ of A. We now know that they are positive, so |λ +1|=λ +1, and their polar angle is θ = 0; the new necessary and suﬃcient condition is c −1 = 3−2 √ 2 <λ<3 +2 √ 2 = c which concludes the proof. a50 The behavior of the function f (x) that maps eigenvalues of A to eigenvalues of the iteration matrix, and the rôle of the interval (1/c,c),aredepictedinFig.1. Next,wewilldeterminethevaluesofα for which the method converges. To this aim, we provide a result concerning the eigenvalues of matrix A as a function of α. Theorem 5. For α ∈ (−L 0 , L 1 ), all the eigenvalues of A are contained in the positive interval parenleftbigg L 1 − α L 2n−2 + α , L 2n−1 − α L 0 + α parenrightbigg . Proof. On one hand, Theorem 4 guarantees that A has positive eigenvalues; consequently, λ min (A) = 1 λ max (A −1 ) . On the other hand, Theorem 3 assures that C is positive definite. By applying standard results to A = (T + S) −1 (T − S),we get λ max (A)lessorequalslant max i λ 2i+1 (C) min i λ 2i (C) = L 2n−1 − α L 0 + α . (10) Similarly, considering A −1 = (T − S) −1 (T + S) rather than A,yields λ min (A)greaterorequalslant min i λ 2i+1 (C) max i λ 2i (C) = L 1 − α L 2n−2 + α > 0. (11) Together, (10) and (11) imply to the result. a50 From Theorems 4 and 5 we deduce a very important suﬃcient condition of convergence: Theorem 6. Let T be a positive definite Toeplitz matrix. If L 2n−1 + L 2n−2 < c, (12) L 0 + L 1 P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 1717 then the algorithm converges for any α in the convergence interval I con = parenleftbigg L 2n−1 − cL 0 c +1 , cL 1 − L 2n−2 c +1 parenrightbigg . Proof. The idea is to impose that the eigenvalues of A be in (1/c,c). As they belong to the interval given in the previous theorem, it suﬃces to embed that interval into (1/c,c): 1 c < L 1 − α L 2n−2 + α , L 2n−1 − α L 0 + α < c. We obtain α from these inequalities: L 2n−1 − cL 0 c +1 < α < cL 1 − L 2n−2 c +1 which provide the suﬃcient interval of convergence I con .Tofinish,I con is nonempty whenever its length is > 0; and this condition is equivalent to (12). a50 This suﬃcient condition is used to check the convergence of the algorithm: it suﬃces to compute the quantity d = L 2n−1 + L 2n−2 L 0 + L 1 , (13) and see whether it is smaller than c or not (Eq. (12)). Note that the computation of d implies negligible overhead, because the L j are eigenvalues of C 0 , and these eigenvalues, as we have noted before, are precisely the DFT elements needed to eﬃciently implement the circular convolutions. If this convergence check is fulfilled, then there are infinitely many ways of choosing the value α. But which one yields the best convergence rate of the algorithm? The answer to this question is in our final result: Theorem 7. If Eq. (12) is satisfied, then the best possible convergence rate is achieved by choosing α best = L 1 L 2n−1 − L 0 L 2n−2 L 0 + L 1 + L 2n−2 + L 2n−1 . Moreover, the best spectral radius of the iteration matrix (obtained when α = α best ) is ρ best lessorequalslant (d −1) 2 4d < 1 where d is defined as in Eq. (13). Proof. The iteration matrix of the algorithm is C 2 S; our aim is to find the value of the parameter α which minimizes its spectral radius. For any α in the convergence interval I con , Theorem 5 states that eigenvalues λ of A are real and belong to the interval parenleftbig c 1 (α),c 2 (α) parenrightbig = parenleftbigg L 1 − α L 2n−2 + α , L 2n−1 − α L 0 + α parenrightbigg ⊂ parenleftbigg 1 c ,c parenrightbigg . Recall that the spectral radius is ρ(C 2 S) = max braceleftbigvextendsingle vextendsingle f (λ) vextendsingle vextendsingle ,λeigenvalue of A bracerightbig and this maximum should be minimized. Notice in Fig. 1 that | f | is convex in (1/c,c), so it reaches its maximum at the edges of each interval. Hence, ρ(C 2 S)lessorequalslantmax braceleftbigvextendsingle vextendsingle f parenleftbig c 1 (α) parenrightbigvextendsingle vextendsingle , vextendsingle vextendsingle f parenleftbig c 2 (α) parenrightbigvextendsingle vextendsingle bracerightbig . Observing the growth of | f |, we get that this maximum is | f (c 1 (α))| if c 1 (α)c 2 (α) lessorequalslant 1, and | f (c 2 (α))| otherwise. This maximum is minimized when c 1 (α)c 2 (α) = 1. Direct manipulations show that the only value of the parameter which verifies this condition is α = α best . Moreover, it turns out that c 2 (α best ) = d ∈[1,c) so finally ρ(C 2 S)lessorequalslant vextendsingle vextendsingle f parenleftbig c 2 (α best ) parenrightbigvextendsingle vextendsingle = vextendsingle vextendsingle f (d) vextendsingle vextendsingle = |d −1| 2 4|d| which is smaller than 1, because d belongs to Pascal’s snail. a50 1718 P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 Remark. By choosing this parameter, the relative error between two consecutive iterations of the algorithm turns out to be bardblx k − xbardbl= vextenddouble vextenddouble (C 2 S)(x k−1 − x) vextenddouble vextenddouble lessorequalslantρ best bardblx k−1 − xbardbl so after k steps we have bardblx k − xbardbllessorequalslant(ρ best ) k bardblx 0 − xbardbl (14) where ρ best lessorequalslant (d −1) 2 4d < 1. (15) This confirms that, regardless the initial guess vector x 0 , the algorithm always converges to the solution x, and gives an expression for the rate of convergence. 5.1. An additional result about the convergence As we have pointed out, the proposed algorithm may not always converge because the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix C 2 S may have modulus greater than 1. For instance, for ill-conditioned matrices T, the suﬃcient condition for convergence (12) is no longer fulfilled, and ρ(C 2 S) greaterorequalslant1; in other words, for some initial guess vectors, the iterative algorithm may not converge. Nevertheless, not everything is lost in that case; here we give an additional general result about the convergence of this method: Theorem 8. For positive definite Toeplitz matrices T of large enough size n, most of the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix C 2 Sare clustered around 0. Proof. By using the expression of C −1 given by Eq. (7), and the fact that C −1 C = I,wegetC 2 S = I −C 1 T,soitseigenvalues λ are λ(C 2 S) = 1− λ(C 1 T). On the other hand, for positive definite Toeplitz matrices T, [24] guarantees that the eigenvalues of C 1 T are clustered around 1, except for some outliers. Moreover, in [26] it is proven that they are even more clustered around 1 than the eigenvalues of matrix (T + S) −1 T, which appears in the approach described in [23]. More precisely, for 0 < epsilon1 < 1 and n large enough, we can assure that vextendsingle vextendsingle λ(C 2 S) vextendsingle vextendsingle = vextendsingle vextendsingle 1− λ(C 1 T) vextendsingle vextendsingle lessorequalslantepsilon1 < 1 for all eigenvalues λ(C 2 S) except for some outliers. a50 Remark. We have proven a general result: most of the eigenvalues of C 2 S have small enough moduli. This means that our algorithm in many cases can get to the solution, even for ill-conditioned large matrices T, whenever the initial guess vector turns out to be properly chosen. The choice of the initial guess vector x 0 is a diﬃcult theoretical problem. To ensure convergence, it suﬃces that the initial error vector x 0 − x belongs to the span of the eigenspaces associated to eigenvalues |λ(C 2 S)| < 1. If the maximum of these moduli is |λ 0 |lessorequalslantepsilon1 < 1 then, after k iterations, the error is (x k − x) = (C 2 S) k (x 0 − x), bardblx k − xbardbllessorequalslant|λ 0 | k bardblx 0 − xbardbllessorequalslantepsilon1 k bardblx 0 − xbardbl which gives an idea of the rate of convergence of the algorithm, even in the ill-conditioned case. 5.2. Numerical results and discussion We have considered a great variety of Toeplitz systems and observed the performance of the new algorithm, in compar- ison to other techniques: Levinson’s method (implemented in a form that requires 2n 2 flops [4]), the PCG method with the circulant preconditioner given in [23], and the PCG method with Chan’s circulant preconditioner [22] (here renamed PCG2). For each problem, the starting vector was the zero vector, y is a random vector, and the iterations were terminated when thenormoftheresidualTx− y fell below a fixed threshold. All the necessary FFTs were computed using the FFTW package [31,32], taking advantage of the real character of the data. The CPU time was measured by averaging over a number of runs. P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 1719 Fig. 2. Problem A: CPU time as a function of the Toeplitz matrix size, for the new algorithm, PCG, PCG2 and Levinson’s method. Fig. 3. Problem B: CPU time as a function of the Toeplitz matrix size, for the new algorithm, PCG, PCG2 and Levinson’s method. Problem A. The matrices were randomly generated, real, symmetric, and positive definite. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Clearly the new method outperforms the existing ones, for all matrix sizes. ProblemB. Fig. 3 shows the results of the second experiment, for the matrix elements t i = (1+|i|) −2 . This problem appeared in [23] as Problem 6. Once again, the new algorithm outperforms the others, regardless the matrix size. Problem C. This problem corresponds to Problem 1 in [23], defined through a parameter a as t i = a i for i = 0,1,2,3, t i = 0 otherwise. Fig. 4 shows the optimum behavior of our algorithm, as in the preceding problems. Problem D. Corresponds to Problem 2 in [23], defined through a parameter a as t i = a i for all i. In this case the results given in Fig. 5 show that the best performance is achieved either by PCG or the new method, depending on the matrix size. Problem E. The last problem is Problem 4 of [23], defined through two parameters a,b as t i = (i +1)a i +b i .Fig.6illustrates that PCG, PCG2 and the new method compete for the best performance, but there is not a clear favorite for all matrix sizes. 1720 P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 Fig. 4. Problem C: CPU time as a function of the Toeplitz matrix size, for the new algorithm, PCG, PCG2 and Levinson’s method. Fig. 5. Problem D: CPU time as a function of the Toeplitz matrix size, for the new algorithm, PCG, PCG2 and Levinson’s method. In summary, we deduce that, for a given matrix size, one can find examples where a particular method (PCG, PCG2 or the proposed one) outperforms the others. But there is not a unique method with optimal behavior independently of the matrix size. Nevertheless, the algorithm here proposed outperforms the other techniques for a great variety of problems and for a wide range of matrix sizes. When comparing the results, one should keep in mind that the proposed technique does not converge for all sym- metric, positive definite Toeplitz matrices. In particular, the usefulness of the new method is limited when the matrix is ill-conditioned. However, the theoretical results given in this paper help in identifying the class of matrices for which the method is useful. Note that the method can be applied in the nonsymmetric case, though. No attempt was made to improve the convergence rate of the method (say, using α best )ortotunethefreeparameters of the circulant in any other way. Nevertheless, for circulants of size m = 2n,usingα best would lead to better performance. P.J.S.G. Ferreira, M.E. Domínguez / Digital Signal Processing 20 (2010) 1711–1722 1721 Fig. 6. Problem E: CPU time as a function of the Toeplitz matrix size, for the new algorithm, PCG, PCG2 and Levinson’s method. 6. Conclusions It is possible to replace a set of linear equations with a larger but more structured set, the solution of which leads to the solution of the original problem. The question is whether there are computational benefits in doing so. We have tested this idea for Toeplitz equations, since the Toeplitz structure immediately suggests trading-off size by circulant structure. The idea of circulant embeddings, in one way or another, is quite well known. In signal processing, the computation of linear convolutions is routinely accomplished using zero padding and the FFT; see also [19]. However, the idea explored in the present paper uses circulant embeddings in a quite different direction: the Toeplitz set of equations Tx= y (T nonsingular, y known) is mapped into an equivalent, larger set Ca= b with circulant structure, so that both a and b contain unknown quantities. The unknown quantities are determined by a simple iteration (multiplication by C and C −1 ), which constraints the vectors a and b to certain known subspaces. This idea leads to a very simple yet eﬃcient algorithm. Since the method does not converge for all nonsingular T,or even all positive definite T, we gave convergence conditions. We have also presented the results of numerical experiments. The same basic idea might also be tried in the case of submatrices of circulants that are not necessarily Toeplitz. In fact, the idea could in principle be explored for other matrix structures which are “close” to an even more structured class (Hankel matrices and submatrices of retrocirculants, for example). In these cases, however, the potential of the method, at least in its basic form, remains to be seen.

Present address: C/ José Gutiérrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain. This paper explores a seemingly counter-intuitive idea: the possibility of accelerating the solution of certain linear equations by adding even more equations to the problem. The basic insight is to trade-off problem size by problem structure. We test this idea on Toeplitz equations, in which case the expense of a larger set of equations easily leads to circulant structure. The idea leads to a very simple iterative algorithm, which works for a certain class of Toeplitz matrices, each iteration requiring only two circular convolutions. In the symmetric definite case, numerical experiments show that the method can compete with the preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG), which achieves O ( n log n ) performance. Because the iteration does not converge for all Toeplitz matrices, we give necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure convergence (for not necessarily symmetric matrices), and suggest an efficient convergence test. In the positive definite case we determine the value of the free parameter of the circulant that leads to the fastest convergence, as well as the corresponding value for the spectral radius of the iteration matrix. Although the usefulness of the proposed iteration is limited in the case of ill-conditioned matrices, we believe that the results show that the problem size/problem structure trade-off deserves further study.

Although only two bits are sufficient to encode the four DNA bases, efficient lossless compression methods are still needed due to the size of DNA sequences and because standard compression algorithms do not perform well on DNA sequences. As a result, several specific coding methods have been proposed. Most of these methods are based on searching procedures for finding exact or approximate repeats. Low order finite-context models have only been used as secondary, fall back mechanisms. In this paper, we show that finite-context models can also be used as main DNA encoding methods. We propose a coding method based on two finite-context models that compete for the encoding of data, on a block by block basis.

        "doc_abstract": "Motivation: DNA sequences can be represented by sequences of four symbols, but it is often useful to convert the symbols into real or complex numbers for further analysis. Several mapping schemes have been used in the past, but they seem unrelated to any intrinsic characteristic of DNA. The objective of this work was to find a mapping scheme directly related to DNA characteristics and that would be useful in discriminating between different species. Mathematical models to explore DNA correlation structures may contribute to a better knowledge of the DNA and to find a concise DNA description. Results: We developed a methodology to process DNA sequences based on inter-nucleotide distances. Our main contribution is a method to obtain genomic signatures for complete genomes, based on the inter-nucleotide distances, that are able to discriminate between different species. Using these signatures and hierarchical clustering, it is possible to build phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees lead to genome differentiation and allow the inference of phylogenetic relations. The phylogenetic trees generated in this work display related species close to each other, suggesting that the inter-nucleotide distances are able to capture essential information about the genomes. To create the genomic signature, we construct a vector which describes the inter-nucleotide distance distribution of a complete genome and compare it with the reference distance distribution, which is the distribution of a sequence where the nucleotides are placed randomly and independently. It is the residual or relative error between the data and the reference distribution that is used to compare the DNA sequences of different organisms. © The Author(s) 2009.

        "doc_abstract": "Background: The problem of finding the shortest absent words in DNA data has been recently addressed, and algorithms for its solution have been described. It has been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the shortest ones. Results: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. Conclusion: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed additional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing studies on the topic. © 2009 Pinho et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

The distribution used to generate the elements of G can be designed to give with high probability a sub-matrix B of G with a sparse inverse leading to an efficient way of computing the syndrome.

Keywords ZigBee Wireless sensor network Viticulture Acquisition device Remote sensing Energy harvesting 1 Introduction Precision agriculture (PA) and precision viticulture (PV) are production systems that promote variable management practices within a field according to site conditions. The concept is based on new tools and information sources provided by modern technologies, such as yield monitoring devices, soil, plant and pest sensors and remote sensing. Despite the benefits, such diversity is currently restraining the rate of adoption of these technological tools, which varies considerably from country to country, and from region to region (Seelan et al., 2003). The Demarcated Region of Douro (DRD) (a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the oldest Wine Demarcated Region of the World), due to its unique characteristics, poses very specific challenges, mainly due to the topographic profile, pronounced climatic variations and complex soil characteristics. Grape harvest and disease predictions as well as the assessment of the grape value are currently left to the grape growers, without the help of decision-support mechanisms, in an environment where no significant irrigation systems exists. In order to improve the quantity and quality of winegrowers’ products, an array of sensors that monitors the environmental, climatic and physiological parameters is needed. The on-going technological developments in the miniaturization of electronic devices and wireless communication technology have led to the emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The power necessary to effectively run the related circuitry is currently being scaled down, with the help of energy harvested from the environment where the devices are deployed. Strictly speaking, WSN are arrays of electronic devices with sensing capabilities that are interconnected using a radio network. Many architectures exist, ranging from micro-devices with embedded smart sensors to complete self-powered acquisition devices that support a large variety of external sensors (Morais et al., 1996; Gomide et al., 2001; Beckwith et al., 2004; Delin et al., 2005; Hart and Martinez, 2006). Regarding network support, many protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee and proprietary forms of radio network interconnections exist (Lee et al., 2002; Beckwith et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006). There are several key issues to address when selecting a suitable technology for wireless data transfer. One of the most important criteria is the network support, usually determined by the application target, which limits the available offer. Other key factors include data transfer rates and power consumption. Many stand-alone radio-frequency transceivers are suited for cable replacement (point-to-point connections), often using proprietary protocols to enhance data transfer reliability. However, in these RF devices, mesh-type networks are usually not supported due to the complexity of the software implementation. The well known IEEE 802.11 family of standards is able to handle very high data rates, which however imply power-demanding devices. The IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) standard, although capable of supporting a Personal Area Network (PAN), is primarily intended for cable replacement solutions. It does have the capability to form small star-type networks known as piconets and scatternets. Within these networks, a master device performs synchronisation between all connected slaves, rendering high data rates and continuous data transfers possible. Although interesting to deal with a limited number of nodes, it has not been widely adopted for the deployment of large arrays of sensing devices in crops, mainly due to power demands and restrictions on the number of nodes and connections. In contrast, the ZigBee environment has been specifically developed to address the demands of sensor networks, including the need to handle a large number of nodes. ZigBee builds upon the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE, 2003), enabling the creation of complex ad hoc networks with up to 65536 devices, suitable for industrial, agricultural, vehicular, residential and medical environments. The intent of IEEE 802.15.4 is to provide ultra low power consumption and very short wake-up times capabilities at very low cost to devices operating in a Low Rate (250kbps) Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). To this effect, the IEEE 802.15.4 assumes that the data transmitted are short and that transmissions occur at a low-duty cycle (active/sleep times ratio), reducing the overall power needs and enabling the application of battery–powered embedded systems. The ZigBee standard defines the network layer specification to allow the formation of three network topologies: star, tree and peer-to-peer. In the latter topology, also known as mesh-type, every network element can communicate with any other within its range. This allows more complex network formations to be implemented, such as ad hoc and self-configuring networks. These should contain a unique coordinator, responsible for managing all the PAN functionalities and, for instance, retrieving all relevant data from the ZigBee network. This mesh-type topology, which relies on the routing mechanisms for multi-hop provided by the network layer, is a key element for wireless networks of smart acquisition devices in the field. ZigBee also defines the type of device based on the set of functions that is enabled to perform. The Full-Function Device (FFD) can act as a router while the Reduced-Function Device (RFD) is usually an end-device that is only allowed to communicate with its router or coordinator. In addition, ZigBee also provides a framework for application programming in the application layer. More details on ZigBee/802.15.14 networks can be found in the survey (Baronti et al., 2007) and in (IEEE, 2003). Currently, ZigBee is a promising solution to enhance the development of ad hoc multi-hop sensor networks, and a lot of research effort is being invested in adopting and finding new solutions for almost every kind of monitoring purpose (Jinsheng et al., 2006). However, agricultural production systems suffer from the usual delay in the application of these highly innovative technologies. Among the several aspects that constrain these developments we mention the issues related to power management and availability, and the ease with which the systems can be deployed in an open field. This paper addresses some of these challenges and describes a ZigBee multi-powered wireless acquisition device, designed to be part of the remote sensing project of introducing PV in the Demarcated Region of Douro. The system represents an evolution over the SPWAS (Morais et al., 1996) acquisition station, contributing to make highly flexible acquisition systems available for application in PV and remote sensing. Its features include the ability to harvest energy from the environment, in multiple ways. It also contains a software-based method that prevents automatically switched-off nodes from being switched-on soon after, as their batteries charge again. Such cycles have a negative impact on the battery life, and are more difficult and expensive to avoid via hardware. The need to deal with network discovery/connectivity failures and avoid repetitive and wasteful connection attempts is also addressed. The paper describes the overall architecture of this monitoring system (Section 2), then the hardware (Section 3) and software (Section 4) of the basic module around which the system is built, and then reports on the performance of the module in the field, emphasising the energy issues, which are crucial to obtain self-sustained operation. This is the main experimental part of the paper (Section 5), and the results obtained confirm that the hardware and software solutions proposed in the paper do indeed lead to good performance. The conclusions and lessons that were learned in the process are discussed in detail in Section 6, which closes the paper. 2 Remote sensing wireless network for precision viticulture The layout of hillside vineyards in the DRD is strongly conditioned by the original slope and relief of the parcels of vines. Also, the soil is mainly based on complex schist which imposes some constrains in the assessment of its hydrological aspects. The unique characteristics of these vineyards, as well as the topographic aspects, erosion control, vertical planting, the intrinsic limited water availability, and wide temperature span across all day and year, demand the most recent technological tools, such as distributed monitoring and information processing. These may help in understanding vineyard variability and therefore how it might be managed, thus improving the quantity and quality of the wines. A good example of using WSN as a key tool to understand productivity variability can be found in Camilli et al. (2007). As an increasing number of electronic devices with various types of sensors are embedded in agricultural processes, efficient system integration has become a critical goal. The huge amount of data retrieved by intensive field data acquisition needs to be centralized and made available on the web, by using for instance geographical information systems (GIS). On a regional, or even at a global scale, large plantation infrastructures are the result of the interconnection of multiple local plantations, which is the DRD dominant scenario regarding vineyards. Such a distributed platform, which incorporates information from remote sensing, from in situ weather conditions, from water source levels, from soil history, and from farmer knowledge about the relative productivity of selected “Management Zones” of the vineyard, can be applied, for instance, to predict yield and diseases, and to disseminate advice throughout the growing season about the optimum usage of water and the chemical treatments needed. To address the relevant issues regarding the deployment of such a monitoring network in the DRD with its specificities, we propose a remote sensing network architecture, depicted in a simplified way in Fig. 1 . The MPWiNodeZ, as a self-sustaining smart acquisition device, aims to enhance in-field data gathering and to give network support to systems such as those described in (Valente et al., 2006). For each vineyard management zone (VMZ), a ZigBee network of MPWiNodeZ devices can be deployed to acquire data on soil moisture content, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation, among other parameters. The cluster head (CH) operates as a local (or VMZ) sink node for this wireless sensor network. This creates an intermediate level of aggregation nodes that manages the sensor networks and performs local data integration and supervision functions, while maintaining connectivity through the whole region. Since each wine making company may have vineyards located in any location of the DRD, the connectivity between each VMZ and the company office headquarters (shippers’ office in Fig. 1) represents an important issue that must be addressed. To this effect, the clusters are wirelessly linked to the shippers’ office through a TCP/IP-based connection such as GPRS and 802.11 links. To accommodate the disparate data sources from vineyards and its surrounding environment, each acquisition device should also have a high degree of flexibility concerning the types of sensors allowed. To accomplish this goal, the common signal conditioning procedures of acquiring voltage-, current-, frequency- and resistance-output sensors have been complemented with a small set of IEEE 1451 standards to include information about each sensor in a Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS). Each acquisition device has the necessary computing power to verify and validate its own data and convert them to international units, thus reducing the amount of processing at the aggregation node that could have hundreds of devices connected. Fig. 2 illustrates the application of a ZigBee network to enhance remote sensing in a PV environment. For simplicity, only one parameter is shown for each network element. In the case of the MPWiNodeZ device, up to nine parameters can be measured. The experimental results reported in this paper show that the power management and networking solutions adopted do work in practice, both in the laboratory and in the field. The MPWiNodeZ devices will be used to deploy a network of wireless sensors on the canopy of vines, which will be used as a tool to develop models to predict the development of grapevine powdery mildew. 3 The MPWiNodeZ acquisition device In order to better understand various issues in deploying a wireless sensor network in remote sensing of environmental parameters, we have developed a prototype system that satisfies the requirements for self-sustaining network nodes in agricultural environments. The MPWiNodeZ (Multi-Powered Wireless Node ZigBee) device is a small custom board aimed to act as a router or as an end-device in ZigBee networks. It is based on the MPWiNodeX, a generic power-management platform that enables self-sustaining devices. A similar device, denoted MPWiNodeS, based on an off-the-shelf RF transceiver (RC1280 from Radiocrafts, Norway), has also been developed and tested to enable simple star-type networks on a proprietary environment with the main purpose of evaluating and characterizing the power-management platform. The MPWiNodeZ can manage up to three simultaneously energy sources to charge a compact pack of three 1/2 AA-size 650mAh NiMH batteries. The MPWiNodeZ is built around two varieties of waterproof encapsulations to support the harsh environment that an open field presents to any electronic device. The power-management hardware and software systems were carefully designed to withstand the operating conditions. To achieve maximum flexibility, the system recharges its batteries using energy harvested from the surrounding environment, from up to three sources (photonic energy, kinetic energy from moving water in irrigation pipes and from wind), avoiding maintenance and human interference. The MPWiNodeZ device combines these energy harvesting methods with a power-conservative software application that avoids the repetitive use of the available radio channels when joining an existent network, thus extending battery autonomy. The embedded software application is ready for the implementation of the IEEE 1451 object model to achieve a higher degree of sensor interoperability. The core of the MPWiNodeZ is a wireless μ-controller (JN5121 from Jennic, UK) that comprises an 802.15.4 RF transceiver and the ZigBee stack. Besides the embedded communications capabilities, this platform has also been chosen to provide reliable signal conditioning to raw sensors and subsequent data processing. To this effect, it is intended to employ a scaled-down version of the IEEE 1451.1 object model for smart sensors, thus promoting a well-defined communication protocol for high-level sensor-to-network interaction. 3.1 Hardware overview The MPWiNodeZ device offers a rich and flexible set of functions that enables a wide range of sensors to be plugged in, regardless of its computation and communication capabilities with minimal power consumption. By employing the IEEE 1451.1 object model, the MPWiNodeZ device can use this standardized procedure to convert raw data from low-cost analog sensors into meaningful information. The same approach has also been followed in Oostdyk et al. (2006) and Ding et al. (2007), where the implementation of the IEEE 1451 has been simplified to a high-level communication between two ZigBee devices (the coordinator and the MPWiNodeZ), each one acting as a Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP). The JN5121 wireless μ-controller has been chosen as a cost-effective solution. This highly integrated device integrates a 32-bit RISC processor, with a fully compliant 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver, 64kb of ROM, 96kb of RAM, and incorporates a wide range of digital and analogue peripherals. With a low sleep current (below 5μA), the JN5121 provides a versatile solution for wireless sensor networking applications. The block diagram of the MPWiNodeZ device is depicted in Fig. 3 . Besides the μ-controller, it comprises an external 12-bit, A/D converter (AD7888 from Analog Devices, MA, USA). The AD7888 is a micro-power (3μW in power-down mode) ADC with serial interface that operates from a single 2.7V power supply. It contains eight single-ended analog inputs and features an on-chip 2.5V precision reference that may be used (software selectable) for the voltage reference for A/D conversion instead of using the supply voltage. The power-management block is responsible for charging the system battery-pack and additionally it provides data on energy harvested from environment. External sensors are powered by a separate DC–DC converter (MAX710 from Maxim, CA, USA) that converts the battery voltage into a regulated 5V or 3.3V output, pin selectable. This converter is turned on only when needed, otherwise it remains in the shutdown mode. A photograph of the MPWiNodeZ device can be seen in Fig. 4 . 3.2 Energy harvesting and power management When considering an array of sensing devices that are deployed across an extensive agricultural area, the energy supply system is a crucial issue. The traditional, yet most used approach is to use batteries, rechargeable or not. However, these energy reservoirs can store a finite amount of energy, and their replacement and maintenance represents a severe bottleneck. An emerging technique that circumvents this limitation is environmental energy harvesting that exploits energy sources that are ubiquitous to the operating space (Raghunathan et al., 2006). In the present application target, and regarding availability, the most feasible harvesting techniques are related to solar and kinetic energy sources. The power requirements of the MPWiNodeZ device are mostly satisfied by a low-voltage 0.5W solar panel (MSX005 from Solarex, MD, USA), which is used to efficiently charge a compact 3.6V 650mAh NiMH battery-pack. With only this energy source and reservoir, the MPWiNodeZ would operate indefinitely, due to its low-duty cycle operation as a ZigBee end-device. However, this turns out to be insufficient to permanently run a device operating as a network router. To this effect, supplementary kinetic energy is harvested from water and wind flow. In the first case, power is provided by a hydrogenerator placed in the irrigation pipes (which we regard as being similar to a power outlet in the field) and, in the second case, by a small wind-powered generator. Fig. 5 shows photographs of the energy harvesters that have been used. In addition to providing power, the associated harvesting techniques double as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed. Fig. 6 shows the simplified power-management block where, besides the main function of recharging the system battery, it also supplies data on the amount of solar radiation, wind speed and irrigation water flow as a density of pulses related with each parameter. Each pulse sequence is applied to a 4:1 precision multiplexer (MAX4618 from Maxim, CA, USA), which selects the signal to be filtered (by R1 and C1 in Fig. 7 ), in order to generate its mean value. Prior to analog-to-digital conversion, this DC value is amplified by a factor of two, using a fixed-gain operational amplifier (MAX4174 from Maxim, CA, USA). Due to its low power consumption, this amplifier is simply powered from a digital output of the μ-controller. In addition, and since each power-management output signals are open-drain, the other part of the 4:1 multiplexer is used to connect the appropriate pull-up resistor. By using this approach, based on the use of the same components for all inputs, the related measurement chain can be disconnected thus saving energy. 4 Software organization The MPWiNodeZ was built around the ZigBee standard, to give wireless networking capabilities to the acquisition devices. Monitoring needs, regarding the hypothetical sensing devices that may be attached as well as the sampling interval required for each of them, have dictated the implementation of a high-level application protocol. For instance, every attached sensor may have different operating rules that must be transferred, stored and applied by each MPWiNodeZ device. In addition, power-management issues should be addressed to avoid any kind of unpredicted behaviour, such as unreliable battery operation. 4.1 Operation mode The software was designed to meet the demands of battery-operated systems. One major concern is the possibility of system oscillations, or more precisely system on and off cycles, caused by partially charged batteries. The cycles are usually triggered by a battery voltage drop, a consequence of nearly drained batteries. The voltage drop leads to the system being turned off. The battery voltage then rises again, because the load is removed, and the system may be switched on again, and so on. The traditional approach to prevent this undesirable oscillating situation is to add some hysteresis to the power-management circuits. In the case of the MPWiNodeZ device, the solution was implemented in software, and completely avoids the oscillation problem. The application code (developed under the Jennic CodeBlocks environment) that was implemented in MPWiNodeZ device follows the generic state machine represented in Fig. 8 . After a power-on, the hardware is properly configured and left in a state of minimum current consumption, State 0. After this very first initialization stage, a sleep time T 1 is used before going to State 1. State 1 represents the idle state where the battery voltage level is monitored. Every T 2 s, the system wakes-up and samples the battery voltage level. If the battery level is higher than a predetermined value, the system goes to State 2 after the sleep time T 3, otherwise remains in State 1. After switching to State 1, which means that the battery has enough energy, the MPWiNodeZ device tries to discover a nearby router or coordinator for binding. If successful, it is assumed that the acquisition device has the sufficient conditions to operate normally and tries, after the short time T 4, to join the existing ZigBee network (State 3) in order to acquire and store the network parameters for later use. If discovery and joining conditions are not met, it returns to the idle state after the sleep time T 10. State 4 reflects the data acquisition and transmission tasks. The first time that the MPWiNodeZ device goes to this state (on the transition 3→4), it waits the fixed sleep time T 5. The sub-states 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 (separated by the time T 6) are responsible for setting the necessary timing tasks in the data acquisition process (sensors power-on time, capture period, etc.). At the end (sub-state 4.4), the 802.15.4 radio system of the μ-controller is powered on (T 7 interval) to send the acquired data using the saved network parameters. If an acknowledgement is received from the network layer (indicating that data has been transferred to the nearby router or coordinator), the MPWiNodeZ enters in sleep mode during the time T 9 that represents the time between data samples, user defined. In case of failure, it returns to State 1. Besides the above-mentioned, states 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 have additional conditions (dashed curves in Fig. 8), concerning battery voltage levels, that must be met. Whenever the battery voltage falls below a predetermined value, the MPWiNodeZ returns directly to the idle mode waiting for the battery to be operative. Table 1 shows these time intervals (used by default) and gives a short description for each one. 4.2 Functional rules and configuration One of the goals of the MPWiNodeZ device is to promote the on-board extraction of meaningful information about the raw sensors that can be connected. To this effect, and as a first step to adopt the IEEE 1451 family of standards concerning smart sensors, the 1451.0 definition of TEDS is used, mainly to convert raw data into metadata. As a result of this implementation, the MPWiNodeZ is able to perform some local processing tasks and return meaningful sensor data over the network such as the sensor value of the measured parameter in engineering units, rather than the unprocessed, raw result of an analog-to-digital conversion. The TEDS is an electronic data sheet in a standardized format stored in the μ-controller flash memory that describes each attached transducer through the Transducer Interface Module (TIM). Since the MPWiNodeZ has a total input capability of 9 channels (8 analog inputs and a digital counter input), each channel in the TIM must be described. For that purpose, a channel TEDS was developed. It contains information of each transducer such as the transducer type, range limits, physical units and timing restrictions. In this first step to adopt IEEE1451, each channel TEDS was stored in the μ-controller flash memory only during the programming process. If some transducer attached to some input channel is changed, a new programming procedure is needed. In the near future, we intend to upload each TEDS through the wireless network. Beside the characterization of each transducer, the behaviour of the entire MPWiNodeZ device should also be defined. In our implementation, it is defined by a set of functional rules. These rules occupies only four bytes (valid for MPWiNodeZ and MPWiNodeS devices), thus being suitable to upload through the ZigBee network. Table 2 shows the bit coding of these 4-byte rules, where a short description is also given. These 4-byte rules settings virtually define the full-operation mode of each networked MPWiNodeZ device. Besides the usual procedure of enabling each data acquisition channel sampling and time window between each sampling procedure, they also allow other important settings such as the definition of the transmit power level that may be used. When in automatic mode, each MPWiNodeZ device uses the Link Quality Indication (LQI) of the wireless μ-controller to adjust the transmitted power, thus optimizing energy usage during each data transfer. The identification of the sender also poses specific problems that must be addressed. When working with a mesh-type network topology, sender identification is not always possible (an example is when the sender is more than two hops from the coordinator). To overcome this issue, we have decided to transmit the sender identification along with sensor data. Fig. 9 shows the ZigBee protocol KVP (Key Value Pair) frame used in data transmission. Essentially, our ZigBee payload comprises the sender identification, the 4-byte device operating rules and data payload flowing between the MPWiNodeZ device and the network coordinator. This data payload field contains the data acquired from the attached sensors as well as the time stamp which will be discussed in the next section. 4.3 Time stamp Time synchronization is a common requirement for wireless sensor networks since it allows collective signal processing, sensor and source localization, data aggregation, and distributed sensing (Milenković et al., 2006). In some applications of wireless personal area networks, synchronized time stamps are critical for proper correlation of data coming from different sensors and for an efficient sharing of the communication channel. Time stamping is also important in the case of intermittent communication within multi-hop networks that can significantly postpone transmission of the sensors’ data. Remote sensing in precision agriculture is one example of a networking sensing application where real-time requirements are not strict. Due to the process inertia, most of the measurements are commonly taken with a time base of several minutes, which relaxes the algorithms that provide a time stamp for each data sample. Such time scales are appropriate for parameters such as air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and sap flow. For the planned sensing network applications of the MPWiNodeZ device, the time stamps do not require precision of seconds; 1min is a typical value. The time stamp is usually tagged to a data sample by the ZigBee coordinator every time that a data frame is received. However, a more flexible mechanism has been added in order to support acquisition devices that have an embedded Real-Time Clock (RTC). The general idea is to add a time stamp as soon as possible, at the origin of the data if at all possible. If the MPWiNodeZ device uses a low-power RTC (in our case DS1302 from Dallas Semiconductor, CA, USA), a valid time stamp data is immediately transmitted to the coordinator. If not, the time stamp is reset to 0, indicating that the next node must insert it. A network router with RTC hardware capabilities may have to insert all the time stamps if none of the nodes have the mechanism for doing so. Otherwise, the insertion of the time stamp is left to the network coordinator. Fig. 10 illustrates the described process where the seconds field in the time stamp is used for illustration purposes only. In this example, device A takes some measurements at Coordinator Time (CT) 15:43:28. Since device A does not have a RTC, it simply clears the time stamp field. Device C, which has a RTC, receives the data payload at CT 15:43:36, inserting that time in the time stamp field. Finally, the data reaches the coordinator at CT 15:43:40, which inserts the samples values in the internal database with the 15:43 time stamp. 5 Experimental results In order to properly evaluate the MPWiNodeZ device, a two-phase experimental methodology was used. It validates the power-management solutions during all active time periods (acquisition, processing, transmission and reception), and tests the operational issues regarding software implementation of the state machine under critical network conditions. The first phase took place in a controlled laboratorial environment, where a small ZigBee network was formed by using a coordinator (connected to a laptop through a RS232 link), two network routers (one hop away from the coordinator) and two MPWiNodeZ devices (as the one shown in Fig. 4) as end-devices, each connected to its router. The second experimental phase was performed under real operating conditions in a nearby vineyard. To this effect, an MPWiNodeZ was used to acquire air and soil temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation data, as depicted in Fig. 11 . To test the discovery and joining procedures of the ZigBee application framework, two routers (actually two MPWiNodeZ devices running the router application software) were used in between the MPWiNodeZ under test and the coordinator (located in the laboratory). The main goal of the first stage experiments was the validation of all software solutions, including the described state machine and the evaluation of the power-management platform in low-duty cycle operation modes and under critical situations, such as the power-up conditions after a battery charging cycle has been initiated. The handling of these situations usually requires a large amount of power that we needed to quantify and measure, especially when running network discovery/joining procedures. Because this first stage of the experimental setup exercises the system under particularly severe conditions, it provides important insight about the deployment of ZigBee-based systems running on batteries charged from energy harvested from the surrounding environment. In order to take proper and representative waveforms of battery voltage and current consumption profiles, this evaluation had to be performed in the laboratory. To best describe real operating conditions, several low-power analog sensors were used: three temperature sensors for measuring two air and one soil temperature (LM60B from National Semiconductor, CA, USA), one relative humidity sensor (HybridCap from Panametrics, USA) and two solar radiation sensors (TSL251 and TSL230 both from Texas Instruments, USA). The sampling rate of acquired data was kept randomly variable between 30s and 30min to create several battery discharging profiles. Fig. 12 shows the first cycle starting from the power-up condition (state 0) until the acknowledge has been received after a successful data transmission (state 5). The power supply current was measured by using a precision 6 1/2 digit multimeter (Keithley model 2000) with data logging capabilities connected to a computer. For this purpose, the maximum number of data points allowed (1000) was used. To fit this power consumption profile into a 1000-point window with sufficient resolution to also describe system operation throughout the entire cycle, the time periods between states were reduced, specifically T 1 = T 3 = T 5 =7s. As can be observed from Fig. 12, the total time between State 2 and the end of State 3 is approximately 2s (T 4), which represents the most power-demanding period. In fact, during this period the MPWiNodeZ device must search an available network and issue a joining request. In order to save a significant amount of battery energy, it is only allowed a one-shot joining process. If it fails, the system will resume T 10 + T 3 later, according to Fig. 8. After this stage, where the network parameters are acquired and saved for later use, the first acquisition task will be triggered T 5 later. For normal operation, the acquisition process will then be repeated every T 9 s. Under the application scope of the MPWiNodeZ device, T 9 may take values of the order of several minutes. With a reasonable value of 10min, probably even greater, a coarse average current consumption would be given by (1) 〈 i 〉 = I ′ T ′ + I 9 T 9 T ′ + T 9 where I′ corresponds to the average current of the active period (State 4.4→State 5). Considering T′≈ T 8 =2s, T 9 =600s, I′∼40mA and the measured sleep current I 9 =0.11mA, the expression (1) leads to the average value of 243μA. Fig. 13 illustrates the case when no network is available at that time. As expected, the MPWiNodeZ fails the discovery/joining process and continues to try every T 10 + T 3, assuming that the battery has enough energy. During this process, and considering a current consumption of 50mA during T 4 and 110μA otherwise (sleep times T 10 and T 3), the average value of current consumption is given by (2) 〈 i 〉 = 50 T 4 + 0.11 T 10 + 0.11 T 3 T 4 + T 10 + T 3 ( mA ) which for the intended application scope with T 10 =120s, T 3 =120s and T 4 =2s, results in an average current consumption of approximately 522μA. During the normal acquisition process, initiated on State 4, the μ-controller checks the battery conditions and loads from memory the operational rules that specify which channels to be sampled. Fig. 14 shows some waveforms that illustrate this procedure. The DC–DC converter that supplies the external sensors is turned-on during approximately 100ms in order to stabilize the voltage output. After this time, external sensors are sampled by the analog-to-digital converter which will enter automatically in a sleep mode after the required conversions. At the same time, if rules apply, the multiplexer is enabled to start averaging the pulse outputs from the power-management block (solar panel in this case). The bottom waveforms of Fig. 14 show this procedure. During this enable period, a pulse train appears at the output of the multiplexer in order to be filtered. After the necessary voltage stabilisation time, the amplifier is powered on, supplying the signal <PULSESP>, which is amplified by a factor of two, to the μ-controller internal ADC. The time that the multiplexer is enabled can also be observed in Fig. 12 after the State 4. As can be seen, at the end of time T 5, the sensors are turned on and data acquired. After that, the μ-controller enables the multiplexer and goes sleep mode again. After a period of 2s, it wakes and turns on the amplifier (current consumption has risen from 110μA to 400μA). After the acquisition, the MPWiNodeZ performs all computations and send the data samples over the ZigBee network. After the first evaluation phase, one MPWiNodeZ device, still operating as an RFD, was tested as an acquisition device operating under real conditions, as seen in Fig. 11, and sending real-time data over a ZigBee network. The objective of this second evaluation phase was the validation of the described state machine but under operation as a ZigBee network router. For this evaluation scenario, the ZigBee network topology has changed to one coordinator, two network routers (both MPWiNodeZ, one being under evaluation) and an end-device (located in the vineyard). The power supply current consumption of the router device has been traced and is shown in Fig. 15 , where it can be seen the router joining process (first 2s). After this first stage, the MPWiNodeZ operates as expected, routing packets from the end-device to the coordinator and vice-versa. As can be seen, a current consumption of almost 50mA at all times places significant demands on the power-management system, which may need an energy supplement harvested from the surrounding environment. Fig. 16 shows the battery voltage profile of the MPWiNodeZ device located in the vineyard. The battery was charged by the low-power solar panel that was also used to measure the solar irradiance. The result of this measurement is illustrated as the <PULSESP> value, which is only showed for battery correlation purposes. In this 6-day window, the battery was kept in the charging mode until its voltage reaches almost 4.2V. When it happens, the software procedure keeps the battery in a float condition providing a trickle charge mechanism. Data were received by the ZigBee coordinator at intervals of 60s, which we consider the most demanding condition in practice, considering the scope of this MPWiNodeZ application. The battery voltage profile depicted in Fig. 16 has been determined in low–medium solar irradiance values (less than 100W/m2), the batteries being charged with this energy source only. As can be seen, even with a data transmission every 60s, the battery voltage was always above 3.9V. 6 Final remarks and conclusions We have shown the feasibility of a ZigBee-based remote sensing network, intended for precision viticulture in the Demarcated Region of Douro. The network nodes are powered by batteries that are recharged with energy harvested from the environment. The power-management aspects have been found to be particularly critical, the main issues being the on–off cycles caused by partially charged batteries, and connectivity/network failures that lead to repeatedly unsuccessful connection attempts. We have designed the nodes to deal correctly with these issues, and tested the correctness of the solutions adopted by testing the nodes under particularly severe conditions. The testing and deployment of the devices was a two stage process. In the first stage, the devices were tested in the laboratory to validate the solutions that had been implemented, with particular emphasis on the power-management aspects. The power consumption profiles measured during the tests validated the software-based solution, based on a finite state machine. The second and final stage was the deployment of a network of devices in the field (see Fig. 11), a vineyard, with the cooperation of a winegrower. All results obtained so far confirm that the system works as envisaged, and operates reliably. We have concluded that the system nodes are able to sustain themselves based on solar energy alone; in other words, a ZigBee-based sensor network powered by batteries recharged by solar energy alone is feasible, if the networking and power-management issues are handled as proposed. No new hardware or software issues appeared when operating the system in the field. The system is in principle also able to harvest kinetic energy from wind and water in pipes. However, testing of these harvesting techniques has not been performed, for two reasons: first, these energy sources are more relevant to routers, which need a permanent energy supply, than to network nodes, which are less critical and can shut themselves off if necessary. Second, the performance of the nodes was our main concern and the main purpose of our study. The system was endowed with the possibility of harvesting from both solar and kinetic energy sources in anticipation of future applications, including for example applications in greenhouses. A router placed inside a greenhouse would clearly benefit from harvesting kinetic energy from water in pipes inside the greenhouse itself. The router current consumption of 50mA would drain fully charged 650mAh batteries in less than 13h. The fact that the amount of solar energy is likely to be reduced by the filtering effect of the greenhouse itself provides additional motivation to consider alternate energy sources. The testing of the router and nodes under such circumstances is planned and will be reported in a future work.

        "doc_abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to summarise the authors' experience in furthering the educative use of Information Technology and the internet in the primary schools of northeast Portugal. The main goal of the Programme \"Internet in Schools\" is the development of Information Technology in Portuguese schools. It focuses on the use of the technology, rather than on its immediate pedagogical use. The characteristics of the target regions help in understanding this aim: teachers and students, as well as the population in general, were largely unaware of the potential of IT in general. Design/methodology/approach - The project, the first and still the largest of its kind in Portugal, ultimately involved 1,137 schools, more than 1,700 teachers, and roughly 13,000 pupils. It was decided to centre the training process in the schools and communities themselves. The methodology implemented is distributed rather than centralised, and involves a series of school visits interspersed with training sessions. Findings - The transfer of the training process from the university campus to the schools and communities themselves allowed for a very high degree of teacher participation. The first school visit was vital, allowing for the creation of a strong feeling of empathy between the trainer and the teachers and pupils. This was undoubtedly one of the main factors that lead to an easier and more enthusiastic participation from the teachers. The efforts to put theory into practice in the classrooms were rewarded by a quicker rate of acceptance of IT in the classroom. The use of the internet, namely of web services and e-mail, was stimulated through the various training and awareness raising sessions (supported by Netmobiles) directed at the community in general. Such sessions enabled many individuals in the region to have their first contact with and experience of IT. This constitutes a sound and valuable contribution in terms of awareness raising, training and development towards IT in the region. The following factors played a very important role in the achievement of the goals: the training team was always present or could be easily contacted; both teachers and pupils contributed with material and resources; there was a continuous exchange of experiences; a vast number of individuals and entities participated in the project. Originality/value - This was the first and still the largest approach of its kind in Portugal, and this is the only paper purposing and describing the used methodology in detail and the main conclusions reached. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

The deployment of large mesh-type wireless networks is a challenge due to the multitude of arising issues. Perpetual operation of a network node is undoubtedly one of the major goals of any energy-aware protocol or power-efficient hardware platform. Energy harvesting has emerged as the natural way to keep small stationary hardware platforms running, even when operating continuously as network routing devices. This paper analyses solar radiation, wind and water flow as feasible energy sources that can be explored to meet the energy needs of a wireless sensor network router within the context of precision agriculture, and presents a multi-powered platform solution for wireless devices. Experimental results prove that our prototype, the MPWiNodeX, can manage simultaneously the three energy sources for charging a NiMH battery pack, resulting in an almost perpetual operation of the evaluated ZigBee network router. In addition to this, the energy scavenging techniques double up as sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed, a capability that avoids the use of specific sensors. Keywords Energy harvesting Power management Energy sources Acquisition station Precision agriculture 1 Introduction The energy necessary for the deployment of stand-alone wireless sensor networks in large, open fields still dominates the overall system budget (Rabaey et al., 2000). The harvesting of energy from the surrounding space to power these systems is a solution being explored by several authors, including Wang et al. (2006); Thomas et al. (2006); Cantatore and Ouwerkerk (2006) and Priya et al. (2005). These works cover areas such as irrigation control systems, weather and environmental monitoring, greenhouse control, animal identification and health monitoring. But to effectively attain perpetual operation further enhancements in energy scavenging and more efficient power conditioning methods are required. In the case of precision agriculture (PA), massive amounts of data (Moreenthaler et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2006) are gathered to estimate, for instance, a growth profile, which suggests that sensors or even complete acquisition systems should be installed close to the plant itself. This implies dense ad-hoc networks of wireless devices, sufficiently flexible to support the disparate sources of data that can be extracted from the plant and its surrounding environment (Stafford, 2000). Besides, the wireless network should be able to cover a large area, which means that each acquisition device should be capable of operating as a network router. Fig. 1 shows an illustration of our motivation scenario where a ZigBee network is deployed on a vineyard management zone to collect environmental data. The harvested energy sources are usually ubiquitous in the nodes’ surrounding space but random in nature (Paradiso and Starner, 2005; Hande et al., 2007), a characteristic that dictates the use of energy reservoirs, typically rechargeable batteries or, more recently, ultracapacitors (Park and Chou, 2006). In the case of wireless nodes operating as network routers the energy demands are considerable, and several sources of energy, possibly of different nature, may be required. This raises questions about the power density associated with such sources, how to harvest and manage them to achieve self-sustained, perpetual operation (Corke et al., 2007). Design considerations regarding sensor networks, hardware design, network and medium access control protocols, battery management and harvesting techniques are discussed for instance in Raghunathan et al. (2005); Chou and Park (2005); Mainwaring et al. (2002) and Jiang et al. (2005). Dubois-Ferrière et al. (2006) describe TinyNode, a generic platform for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, which operates with a small solar panel used to replenish two separate energy buffers (primary and secondary). Although not intended for perpetual operation, the authors present an interesting and useful comparison between supercapacitors and batteries for variable operation duty-cycle. They also present a comparison between current consumption of similar platforms, the Mica2, the Telos Sky, the EyesIFX and the TinyNode. The solution to power indoor routers proposed by Hande et al. (2007) depends on a photonic energy harvesting device that consists of a set of solar cells connected in series-parallel to scavenge energy from 34 W fluorescent lights. However, the approach has drawbacks: on one hand, each router requires two nodes operating at 50% duty-cycle to minimise power consumption, a solution that duplicates the number of devices. On the other hand, it uses many solar cells that have to be located close to the lamps. Chou and Park (2005) mention the need for multiple power sources, but they regard this power fragmentation problem as a consequence of the fact that such energy sources may not be available at all times. Park and Chou (2006) review the Helicomote, the Prometheus, the Everlast and the PUMA as energy harvesting systems and present the AmbiMax, an energy harvesting circuit that uses a solar panel and a wind generator to charge a supercapacitor-based energy storage system. In this case, the authors have focused their research in the harvesting efficiency rather than in controlling the charging process to avoid, for instance, the battery aging issue. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how to take advantage of the existence of multiple energy sources in agricultural and livestock environments (open-field crops, greenhouses, hydroponic and aquaculture systems, and stables) by harvesting energy from the sun, wind and moving water, as discussed in Section 2. The energy harvesters used in our experiments comprise a small solar-panel, a small hydro-generator placed in a nearby irrigation or hydroponic water pipe and a wind generator prototype that was designed to be part of the supporting structure of each acquisition platform. Section 3 describes the power-management behind a wireless data acquisition platform (WDAP) that uses the energy harvested from the three sources to simultaneously replenish a common 650mAh NiMH battery pack, enabling almost perpetual operation of a network router with general-purpose data acquisition capabilities. Another feature of our approach, which complements the idea of harvesting from multiple sources, is to use the energy harvesting circuits as sensors of solar radiation and wind speed, which are relevant parameters in precision agriculture and other applications. This fusion or integration of the functions of generators and sensors makes conventional, separate sensors unnecessary. Regarding wireless network support, we have chosen (Morais et al., 2008) the ZigBee standard as a tool to create sensor an router nodes. Section 4 describes our main experimental results: laboratory as well as outdoor experiments confirm the feasibility of self-sustained near-perpetual operation of our WDAP. For this purpose we have built two similar data acquisition systems, targeted for different applications, their main difference being the wireless support. Our results also show that the built-in sensors provide measures that are in good agreement with those of conventional, reference sensors. Our conclusions and final remarks are presented in Section 5, which closes the paper. 2 Harvesting energy from the environment There is a variety of energy sources in the environment around a sensor network (Thomas et al., 2006; Paradiso and Starner, 2005) that are of potential interest for energy harvesting. They include photonic (includes solar energy as well as artificial lightning); vibrations (harvested using piezoelectric, electro-magnetic and capacitive converters); kinetic (available in moving water in rivers, pipes and wind flow); magnetic (magnetic fields surrounding AC power lines); pressure; and heat differentials (harvested using thermoelectric elements), where a comprehensive overview of these can be found in (Roundy et al., 2004). However, many of these sources may have to be neglected due to practical constraints or challenges raised by the low energy density, target power requirements and, in some cases, feasibility of the energy harvesting method. Solar energy is the most efficient natural energy source available for sensor networks in outdoor applications (Thomas et al., 2006). An understanding of the relative importance and potential of solar and wind energy requires data on solar irradiation and wind velocity. The PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System) on-line solar irradiation data utility, part of the SOLAREC action at the JRC Renewable Energies Unit of the European Commission (available at collects such data. The results for a few locations in Europe are summarised in Table 1 . It also includes wind data (the values for Vila Real were obtained by us, those for the other locations are available at The average horizontal irradiation for the city of Vila Real, northeast Portugal, is about 420.6 mWh/(cm2 day). A network router device with a 40mA continuous average current draw at 3.3V would require an energy of about 3168mWh/day, which can be harvested by a 10% efficient, 75.3cm2 solar panel. The active area of the solar panel has to increase to 215.1cm2 if we take the worst case value of 147.3mWh/(cm2 day) for the same location. If the solar panel inclination is optimal then the active area may be reduced to 130cm2. Table 1 also shows the average wind speed and the probability that the wind velocity exceeds the Beaufort value 4, which corresponds to an average wind velocity of 5.5–7.9m/s, or a median velocity of 6.7m/s, over a 10-min interval (see also Fig. 2 ). In the context of precision agriculture, and specially in hydroponic practices or close to irrigation systems, it makes sense to explore the kinetic energy from moving water. This can be harvested through a suitable hydro-generator and, as we will see, it may considerably supplement the WDAP energy reservoir. Our multi-source energy supply harvesting strategy, including the appropriate enclosure box, is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The WDAP is used in a vineyard management zone to collect data from soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation as a part of an on-going project. The energy is in this case supplied by sun, wind and moving water. In the latter case, the energy is harvested by a hydrogenerator located in a nearby irrigation pipe. 2.1 Solar-energy harvesting Solar-energy harvesting is based on the well-known principle of photo-voltaic conversion, and provides the highest power density (15 mWcm−2on a bright sunny day), making it the best-suited choice to power wireless acquisition systems in outdoor applications. Since the power output of small solar panels is limited, two main design principles for the solar-harvesting modules are considered. First, the system should extract the maximum power at each time instant and, second, the efficiency of the power management sub-systems should be maximised. In practice, strict adherence to these principles is difficult, and trade-offs have to be considered, due to the interaction of factors such as the characteristics of the solar cells and their active area, power conditioning features, application requirements of the wireless system and, the chemistry and capacity of the batteries used to store the harvested energy. But to maximise solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency the power conditioning subsystem should operate at the solar panels’ maximum power point (MPP), the point in the V–I characteristic that corresponds to the maximum power transfer. Our prototype, the MPWiNodeX platform, uses a commercial solar panel (MSX-005 from Solarex, USA) chosen because of its small size, availability and low cost. This 8-cell solar-panel has an active area of 57.0 mm × 95.8 mm (54.6cm2), a rated V oc of 4.6V and I sc of 160mA. The MPP occurs at a voltage of approximately 3.1V, which means that the power conditioning circuit should ensure operation at (or near) this point. Regarding the harvesting circuit, one approach is to clamp the output terminals of the solar panel to a rechargeable battery (Raghunathan et al., 2006). This forces the solar panel to operate at a point on its V–I curve determined by the battery’s terminal voltage. This has the advantage of minimising the energy losses in the transfer mechanism, but depends on a careful choice of battery and solar panel in order to ensure that the operating point of the system remains close to the MPP. In the cited example, two NiMH batteries are charged, via a blocking diode, by a solar panel with a MPP occurring at 3.0V. Battery voltage varies between 2.2 and 2.8V, and due to the voltage drop in the blocking diode, the voltage across the solar panel remains close to optimal. It only harvests energy when the solar panel output voltage is 0.7V higher then that of the battery which means that a significant amount of energy cannot be harvested. Moreover, there is no tracking of the MPP, which is essential to achieve high harvesting efficiency (Park and Chou, 2006). Also, the energy flow is unmanageable, resulting in uncontrolled daily recharge cycles and placing a significant stress on the battery. Our solution represents an integrated approach to the management and conditioning of the solar-panel, wind generator and hydrogenerator blocks (described in the following two sections). It includes a smart-battery charge control that balances battery lifetime and energy harvesting efficiency, as described in detail in Section 3.1. 2.2 Wind flow kinetic energy harvesting Wind flow kinetic energy can be harvested by a wind turbine which extracts energy from moving air by slowing it down and using the obtained energy to drive a generator. The power P w associated with a quantity of air of mass m, flowing at speed v in the x direction, is the time derivative of the kinetic energy: (1) P w = 1 2 ρ A d x d t v 2 = 1 2 ρ A v 3 , where ρ is the air density in kgm−3, A is the cross-sectional area in m2 and v is the upstream or undisturbed wind speed in m/s. An ideal turbine can extract a fraction of the power in (1) given by the Betz coefficient 16/27 or 59.26% (Betz, 1926). The power extracted by a practical turbine is (2) P m = C p 1 2 ρ A v 3 = C p P w . where C p is the performance coefficient of the turbine. Assuming that the turbine is coupled to a transmission with efficiency η m which drives a generator of efficiency η g , the electrical power P e available can be written as (3) P e = C p η m η g P w = C p η m η g 1 2 ρ A v 3 . Wind turbines can be classified into two general types based on the axis of rotation. Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) have the rotor shaft parallel to ground and must be pointed into the direction of wind flow by some means. They are usually used for large-scale windmills for electrical energy production. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have a vertically rotating main rotor shaft. Although less efficient, VAWTs offer some important advantages in small-scale wind generator design, the Darrieus and Savonious designs being the most common. They are omni-directional, simpler, can be fixed in both ends and can respond quicker to changes in wind direction and velocity. The Darrieus type is based on lift forces which cause the rotor to move faster than the wind. They are efficient but usually not self-starting. The Savonious type is less efficient because they are drag-type devices (S-shaped cross section) but they are self-starting and virtually maintenance-free. To design the wind generator suited for our application it is necessary to bear in mind a number of practical and functional issues. Firstly, the energy harvested from the wind is intended to supplement the energy available for battery charging. Secondly, the wind generator should double up as a sensor, and be capable of supplying data on wind speed. Finally, the wind generator should be part of the structure of the acquisition station and especially of the rod which stands vertically on the ground (right side of Fig. 3). This means that the turbine swept area, namely its diameter, should be minimised. To fulfil these requirements, a Savonious design was chosen, despite its inherent low efficiency. The power extraction coefficient could be increased by adding a convergent nozzle to increase the rotor speed (Shikha et al., 2003). However, this requires wind coming from a fixed direction, which is not the case in our application target. A free moving vane would force the convergent nozzle into the direction of the wind, and could be used to obtain information about wind direction. The efficiency can be improved in a more simpler way by adopting a multi-blade rotor design. Fig. 4 illustrates the two VAWT that were constructed to evaluate the wind energy harvesting techniques. The right one is based on a six-blade Savonious design with 60 mm diameter and 200mm height (0.012m2 swept area), while the left one is based on three-stage based design as proposed by Hayashi et al. (2005). Assuming air standard conditions(pressure of 101.3kPa and temperature of 273K) and a power coefficient C p of 0.1, these turbines should extract a mechanical power of 97mW at a wind speed of 5m/s. 2.3 Water-flow kinetic energy harvesting The energy of moving liquids in pipes, such as water or liquid nutrients, can be harvested with a small-size hydrogenerator. To our best knowledge, this approach has not been explored to supply energy to small electronic devices in precision agriculture. We regard the pipes of irrigation control systems as power outlets within the crops. This idea may be even more relevant in aquaculture or hydroponics practices, where water is always recirculating in pipes. This suggests the possibility of supplying power to a sensor network based on the energy harvested from these pipes. To explore and validate this concept, a commercial hydrogenerator was used as a energy harvester for our WDAP. This device, illustrated in Fig. 5 , was developed and patented by Vulcano to replace batteries in smart gas-based water heating appliances for residential applications. With a principle of operation similar to large hydroelectric generation systems, a small quantity of water, derived from the main duct, is used to spin a turbine coupled to a DC generator. Fig. 6 shows the results of our experiments, conducted with the hydrogenerator for different values of inlet water flow. As can be seen, the hydrogenerator output voltage is almost constant and independent of the water flow value. Due to this characteristic, the water volume cannot be accurately measured, but its logical state can (flowing/not flowing, useful for detecting liquid movements). 3 System architecture To evaluate the energy harvesting techniques as well as the data correlation between reference sensors and data gathered from the energy harvesters, two different WDAP were designed, differing mainly in wireless support. The first and simplest prototype, the MPWiNodeS variant, uses a low-cost 8-bit RISC μ -controller (PIC18LF2620 from Microchip, AZ, USA) and a low-power RF transceiver (RC1280 from Radiocrafts, Norway). This device is currently being used as a development platform for the inclusion of the IEEE 1451 standard for sensor/network interoperability (Wei et al., 2005; Sweetser et al., 2006), with the objective of defining the energy harvesters transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS). The second prototype, the MPWiNodeZ, uses a wireless μ -controller (JN5139 from Jennic, UK) with a ZigBee-compliant stack, and provides the necessary standardised software tools to rapidly deploy sensor and router nodes in the field. These devices follow the block diagram depicted in Fig. 7 . A detailed explanation of the diagram is given in the following subsections. 3.1 Power management The power conditioning subsystem (Fig. 8 ) is responsible for charging the NiMH battery pack with energy harvested from the three considered energy sources. Each source has its own conditioning block, based on a highly efficient boost converter with 3.3/5.0 V output voltage, pin selectable. This converter allows a wide range of input voltages below the battery nominal output, which enables harvesting from low-voltage sources. The shutdown pin is used to implement a pulse charging mechanism, which simultaneously performs MPP tracking to enhance harvesting efficiency. This signal is generated by a comparator with hysteresis powered by the battery due to its ultra-low quiescent current. When the voltage at the charge reservoir capacitor (see Fig. 8) rises above a particular value, the comparator turns the boost converter on, transferring the charge stored at that capacitor to the battery, causing the input voltage to drop. Dropping below the lower-trip point of the comparator will result in the turn-off of the converter. This pulsed operation results in a more efficient charging method (Zhang et al., 2004), where the density of the generated shutdown pulses is related with the capability of the energy source to replenish the input charge reservoir. This relation is, in this work, explored to provide a coarse estimation of the magnitude of the parameter that supplies the energy to the system. To this effect, a second comparator with open drain output is used to generate similar yet independent pulses. The other feature is the output voltage selection pin, used to select the 3.3 or 5.0 V predefined value, which are, in this case, below and above the operating limits of a 3-cell NiMH battery. This is used to define the start and stop conditions, battery charging and floating, respectively. The systems’ power supply is derived from a wide input range DC–DC converter (MAX710 from Maxim, USA). Among other features, it has a low-battery indicator (LBI signal in Fig. 8) that is used to signal the μ -controller when the battery voltage falls below a predefined value, suitable for predicting the power-off. The μ -controller is responsible for sampling the battery voltage value and to control the operation of the conditioning subsystem. When the battery achieves a pre-programmed value, which could be the battery fully charged (BFC) voltage value, a normally closed power switch is used to break the charging path. This switch may also be used for discharging completely the battery as a way to minimise the aging issue by periodically promoting, if necessary, a full discharge/charge cycle. 3.1.1 Solar-panel power-conditioning block When conditioning solar energy, the boost converter described above is a more suited choice since it enables harvesting even in that cases that the solar panel output voltage is lower than the in-charging battery voltage level. As the internal resistance of the photovoltaic cells depends on the light levels, which causes a loss of efficiency when connecting it to the boost converters’ inductor, the input charge reservoir capacitor introduces two important improvements. By monitoring the voltage on this capacitor, the comparator turns on the boost converter when the solar panel voltage output is at its MPP. The comparator will turn-off the converter without allowing the converter’s input voltage to drop below its operating voltage limit. The turn-off condition will remain until the solar panel output voltage rises again to the optimum voltage. The input capacitor also provides a low-impedance path for the inductor current, which allows the efficient bang-bang control of charge transfer (Maxim, 2000). Fig. 9 illustrates the principle of operation of this bang-bang control, where it is also shown how the density of the charge transfer burst pulses are correlated with the received solar radiation intensity. It can be followed that the pulse density ( V PULSE,SP in Fig. 9) increases as the solar irradiance rises, which we regard as a solar radiation sensor output. 3.1.2 Wind generator and hydrogenerator power-conditioning blocks The wind generator is based on a four permanent magnet generator, which creates an alternating sinusoidal voltage with an amplitude and frequency proportional to the extracted wind mechanical power. Depending on the possible electrical connections that we can make with four windings, a rectifier is used before connecting this voltage source to the input of the power-conditioning block. A two-diode full-wave rectifier topology provides the higher electrical power extraction but causes more electromagnetic breaking, because current flows during the entire period. This leads to an equivalent higher starting torque when the DC value reaches the equivalent MPP. In other words, when the DC output from the generator reaches the ON switching condition of the boost converter, a higher current flows in all windings which causes breaking. To reduce this starting torque (enabling operation at lower speeds with the penalty of a lower efficiency) we have followed the half-wave rectifier approach to allow harvesting energy from low-speed winds. However, a power routing scheme can be implemented to switch from the half-wave to the full-wave rectifier mode whenever the wind speed is above a determined value. Power conditioning of these two generators is accomplished by the same principle of operation of the solar-panel power-conditioning block. The differences are the values (resistors in this case) that define the MPP for each energy harvester. The wind generator and hydrogenerator high trip-values were set to approximately 2.0 and 1.6 V, respectively. 3.1.3 Battery charge control The battery charging start and stop conditions are asserted by the μ -controller by means of the selection pin ( 3 / 5 ¯ ) of each boost converter (see Fig. 8). To this effect, the battery voltage is sampled periodically to monitor when it becomes fully charged. When it happens, the μ -controller sets the 3 / 5 ¯ line which causes the boost converter to be turned off because the output voltage is greater than the selected predefined output voltage. If the battery is actually discharging, and its voltage drops below some predefined value, the μ -controller may clear the 3 / 5 ¯ pin, which starts, or resumes, a charging cycle. At first sight, the selection of the switching points is straightforward. The voltage across a 3-cell NiMH battery should not exceed 3 × 1.45V = 4.35V, where 1.45V corresponds to a fully charged NiMH cell. To minimise battery aging, the discharge cycle should last until the voltage falls down to 3 × 0.9V = 2.7V, where 0.9V is the voltage across a completely discharged cell (Ying et al., 2006; Fetcenko et al., 2007). To avoid a fully discharged cell, even knowing that a residual energy may exist, we decided to limit the lower bound to a 3V value. Due to power fragmentation it becomes necessary to balance battery lifetime and energy harvesting efficiency. To better understand the need for the trade-off, consider that the battery is discharging, and that its voltage is, for instance, 3.7V; assume now that, at this stage, an external unpredictable energy source becomes available. Should this fact be ignored and the battery be allowed to continue discharging until its voltage reaches 3.3V? Or should the battery be recharged while the unpredictable energy source is present? It is clear that the strict maximisation of the battery lifetime implies the sub-optimal use of the harvested energy, and increases the probability of running out of power. On the other hand, any attempt to use as much harvested energy as possible might severely limit the duration of the batteries as a result of uncontrolled charging cycles. To overcome this issue, a software-based solution has been implemented. With access to the actual battery voltage value, a software procedure sets the trip voltage values so that complete discharge cycles can be periodically performed, thus yielding a long battery lifetime, and, simultaneously, good harvesting efficiency. 3.2 Data acquisition platform Targeted to PA applications, our WDAP comprises an analog interface based on a low-power analog-to-digital converter (AD7888BRZ from Analog Devices, USA), featuring eight analog inputs with 12-bit resolution (Fig. 7). External general-purpose sensors supply is accomplished by a separate DC–DC converter that is turned on only during the acquisition process. Data from the power-conditioning subsystem, such as the signals from the energy harvesters and the battery voltage sample value, are handled in a different way. The pulses generated by each power conditioning block comparators’ to control the corresponding boost converter are filtered before the analog-to-digital conversion takes place. This is done with an RC filter at the output of a low-power 4:1 multiplexer. The sampled battery voltage is taken by a separate analog channel, through a voltage divider enabled by an analog switch to save energy. 4 Experimental results The energy harvesting methods were evaluated in two different devices (the -S and -Z variants, shown in Fig. 10 ). A MPWiNodeS device was installed outside our laboratory with the purpose of sending periodically solar irradiance, relative humidity, outside temperature and battery voltage data to a base station. This device is being used in a long-term evaluation of the proposed WDAP. Other similar device was used in the laboratory to an in-depth analysis of the power-conditioning subsystem waveforms. On the other hand, a MPWiNodeZ device was deployed in a vineyard as a ZigBee network node to evaluate, in-field, the energy harvesters performance (Fig. 11 ). The performance of the wind turbine was evaluated using a wind tunnel (4 m length, 0.4 m × 0.4 m cross-sectional area). Fig. 12 shows the relevant waveforms obtained with the correspondent power-conditioning block. The pulsed output was filtered to extract its DC value, yielding V ¯ PULSE,WIND . This evaluation was performed at various air speed values which has lead to the transfer function of Fig. 12. As can be seen, V ¯ PULSE,WIND is proportional to wind speed, the linearised transfer function being approximately given by (4) wind velocity = 1 118.3 V ¯ PULSE,WIND + 2.15 ( m/s ) , where V ¯ PULSE,WIND is in mV. For speeds below approximately 2.1 m/s the voltage output from the turbine is not enough ( V WIND < 2 V) for turning on the boost converter, which indicates that this speed value is the minimum value that enables battery charging (as well as data from wind speed). As expected, the extracted electrical power (measured directly on the generator with a resistive load), follows a cubic-law, accordingly to (1). Fig. 13 shows the behaviour of the hydrogenerator power-conditioning block. To illustrate the start charging procedure, the F / C ¯ signal is asserted low to select the charging mode. Until that, the hydrogenerator was operating without any electrical load. As can be seen, the battery starts charging and the power-conditioning block maintains the hydrogenerator working at its MPP (approximately at 1.5 V), by means of the SHDN ¯ HYDRO signal. For the field evaluation of the MPWiNodeS device, eight sensors were used for measuring air temperature (LM50B from National Semiconductor, USA), solar radiation (TSL230 and TSL251 from Texas Instruments, USA) and air relative humidity (HIH-3610 from Honeywell, USA) for creating a discharging profile and measure current consumption. In addition, data from solar radiation (obtained from the solar panel), wind speed (obtained from the wind turbine) and from battery were also transmitted to the base station for posterior analysis. The operation mode was deliberately set to be a relatively high duty-cycle, 10 s in a 60s time-frame (16.7%). To get quicker results, a battery with a lower capacity (220mAh) was used. The result of this evaluation period, regarding the battery behaviour, is shown in Fig. 14 where solar irradiance is also shown. The evaluation was performed over a period of variable weather (cloudy, foggy and bright, winter days). It can be seen that the battery stop charging control has keeping the battery voltage below 4.2 V, although it would be possible to go beyond that value. The MPWiNodeZ device, as a ZigBee network router, was also evaluated. Table 2 summarises the obtained results. By gathering data from V ¯ PULSE,SP and from the TSL230 solar radiation sensor, the transfer function illustrated in Fig. 15 was obtained. 5 Conclusions and final remarks In principle, the energy required to permanently operate the wireless data acquisition nodes and routers in a large sensor network can be obtained by harvesting energy sources present in the environment. Our multi-powered platform was designed for applications in precision agriculture, and focuses on solar and kinetic energy sources (wind and water in pipes). The system that we built proves that the three harvesting methods suffice to supply a generic WDAP energy store. Even with low values of solar radiation, the combination of the three energy sources has supplied an energy of about 58 mAh, more than the 39mAh required by network routers. We have observed that the wind turbine is able to generate an important fraction of the harvested energy, in certain cases close to the needs of router nodes. Improving these generators may pay off in the future, particularly in applications where irrigation pipes are absent. At the opposite extreme one finds applications in greenhouses, hydroponic or aquaculture systems, in which case the wind is unlikely to play a major role but moving water in pipes is abundant, reversing the relative importance of wind turbines and hydro-generators. Another novelty of our approach is the double functionality of the power management block, which in addition to its usual role also doubles as a sensing device for the parameters that are usually monitored in agricultural environments. Our results and in particular Figs. 15 and 16 confirm that a coarse value of wind speed and solar irradiance can be measured by the corresponding energy harvester without the need for specific sensors. This is yet another advantage of the idea of harvesting from multiple energy sources: when the energy sources are related to parameters that the sensor network needs to measure, the amount of harvested energy may itself yield an estimate of the parameter, making conventional sensors unnecessary. Several improvements to the basic ideas underlying this paper are possible, some of which are presently under study. The system could for example keep a record of each harvested energy source, and use it to predict its future availability. The use of Lithium batteries and ultracapacitors is also being evaluated as a way to slow down battery aging by absorbing the transient power and to minimise the issue described in Section 3.1.3.

Our method is based on the technique of oversampled signal reconstruction. This allows us to explicitly demonstrate that the observed fragility of superoscillating wavefunctions is indeed mathematically closely connected to what in the communication theory community is known as the instability of oversampled signal reconstruction, confirming a previous conjecture.

        "doc_abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the use of the sparse point representation (SPR) methodology for adaptive finite-difference simulations in computational eletromagnetics. The principle of the SPR method is to represent the solution only through those point values indicated by the significant wavelet coefficients, which are used as local regularity indicators. Recently, two kinds of SPR schemes have been considered for solving Maxwell's equations: 1) staggered grids in the time-space domain are used for the discretization of the magnetic and electrical fields, as in the finite-differences time-domain (FDTD) scheme and 2) nonstaggered grids are used in combination with Runge-Kutta ODE solvers. In both cases, 1-D simulations of the SPR method leads to sparse grids that adapt in space to the local smoothness of the fields, and, at the same time, track the evolution of the fields over time with substantial gain in memory and computational speed. However, in the latter case, we found spurious oscillations in the simulations. Therefore, before extending the implementation of the SPR method to higher dimensions, we wanted to evaluate which of these two SPR strategies is more convenient. After a careful theoretical analysis of stability and numerical dispersion comparing the schemes in staggered and nonstaggered grids, we conclude that schemes for staggered grids seem to be preferable from the dispersion viewpoint, especially for low-order schemes and coarse grids. However, by adapting the grid density and increasing the order, SPR schemes for nonstaggered grids also show good performance. In our experiments, no spurious oscillations were detected. We observed that, for a given accuracy, the adaptive scheme on a nonstaggered grid requires less computational effort. Since the use of nonstaggered grids increases the stability range and facilitates the implementation of adaptive strategies, we believe that the SPR method in nonstaggered grids has a very good potential for computational electromagnetics. © 2007 IEEE.",

Since these codes are cyclic, they can be used to correct erasures (errors at known positions) and detect errors, using the locator polynomial via the syndrome, with efficient algorithms. The stability of such codes are, however, very poor for burst error patterns. In such conditions, the stability of the system of equations to be solved is very poor. This amplifies the rounding errors inherent to the real number field. In order to improve the stability of real-number error-correcting codes, other types of coding matrices were considered, namely random orthogonal matrices. These type of codes have proven to be very stable, when compared to DFT codes. However, the problem of detecting errors (when the positions of these errors are not known) with random codes was not addressed. Such codes do not possess any specific structure which could be exploited to create an efficient algorithm. In this paper, we present an efficient method to locate errors with codes based on random orthogonal matrices. © 2006 IEEE.",

In fact, however, for any fixed bandwidth, there exist finite energy signals that oscillate arbitrarily fast over arbitrarily long time intervals. These localized fast transients, called superoscillations, can only occur in signals that possess amplitudes of widely different scales. This paper investigates the required dynamical range and energy (squared L2 norm) as a function of the superoscillation's frequency, number, and maximum derivative. It briefly discusses some of the implications of superoscillating signals, in reference to information theory and time-frequency analysis, for example. It also shows, among other things, that the required energy grows exponentially with the number of superoscillations, and polynomially with the reciprocal of the bandwidth or the reciprocal of the superoscillations' period. © 2006 IEEE.",

Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 227 Practical implementations are possible up to a certain truncation error, which generally tends to be more of a concern when the kernel has infinite support and slow decay (such as the sinc function). B-splines have compact support, and as a result the value of a certain signal sample cannot influence the reconstruction outside a certain finite interval. The kernel function will often lead to a Riesz sequence or a Riesz basis. Riesz bases are a generalization of orthonormal bases, and can be regarded as the result of applying a bounded invertible operator to the elements of an orthonormal basis. A Riesz sequence, on the other hand is an “incomplete basis,” as it is merely a Riesz basis for the closed linear span of the set of functions under consideration. The numerical stability of the representations is very important in practice, as it dictates the magnitude of the effect of dealing with imperfect data. The stability of Riesz bases and Riesz sequences can be measured by looking at the size of their Riesz bounds. Orthonormal bases are perfect from the viewpoint of numerical stability, and their Riesz bounds are both equal to unity. As the ratio of the upper to the lower bound increases, the numerical stability of the representation decreases. It is well known [3], that the tighter (closer to each other) these bounds are the less any small perturbations in the input data will be felt at the output. This paper points out that the Riesz bounds associated with bases built using certain linear combinations of B-splines are better from the stability point of view than bases directly based on B-splines. The notation used is standard: L 2 is the space of all quadratically Lebesgue integrable f , with norm bardblf bardbl 2 := ( integraltext |f | 2 ) 1/2 and inner product 〈f,g〉:= integraltext fg ∗ . The space lscript 2 is its discrete counterpart (quadratically summable sequences), with the usual norm and inner product. The Fourier transform ˆ f of f is ˆ f(w)= ∞ integraldisplay −∞ f(t)e −jwt dt, implying an inverse given by f(t)= 1 2π ∞ integraldisplay −∞ ˆ f(w)e jwt dw. Section 2 provides the necessary background and describes the kernels used, and Section 3 deals with the stability issues. The spaces V ϕ generated by the kernels are discussed in Section 4, and the analysis filters are computed in Section 5. 2. The general sampling scheme It is well known that substitution of the sinc kernel by other functions more adjusted to the specific problem considered may lead to better approximations [4–6]. B-splines are a possibility, and their advantages are well known [2]. Consider the signal space [7] V ϕ := braceleftbigg f(t)= summationdisplay c k ϕ(t − k): c k ∈ l 2 bracerightbigg , k∈Z 228 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 Fig. 1. Typical sampling scheme. Usually, the analysis and synthesis filters are low-pass, i.e., h(t) = ϕ(t) = sinc(t),forT = 1. In the general case they must satisfy the bi-orthogonality condition 〈ϕ(t −k),ϕ ◦ (t −l)〉=δ k−l . where we have chosen the sampling step T = 1. When the function ϕ generates a Riesz basis, the coefficients c k completely characterize the signal. When ϕ is the sinc function, the coefficients c k are essentially the signal samples, but in the more general case they are given by the inner product between f and ϕ ◦ k , i.e., c k =〈f,ϕ ◦ k 〉. See Fig. 1. The family {ϕ ◦ k } is dual to {ϕ k } and its Fourier transform is given by [8] ˆ ϕ ◦ (w) = ˆϕ(w) summationtext k∈Z |ˆϕ(w + 2πk)| 2 . (1) In the least squares sense this means that P V ϕ f = summationdisplay k∈Z angbracketleftbig f,ϕ ◦ k angbracketrightbig ϕ k , where P V ϕ f denotes the projection of f in V ϕ . Butzer et al. [9] studied interpolation and approximation problems in which the sinc kernel is replaced by certain interpolation functions ϕ i with compact support, among which the following will be relevant for us: ϕ 1 (t) = M 2 (t), ϕ 2 (t) = 4M 3 (t) − 3M 4 (t), ϕ 6 (t) = M 4 (t) + 1 3 M 2 (t) − 1 6 parenleftbig M 2 (t + 1) + M 2 (t − 1) parenrightbig , ϕ 7 (t) = 4M 4 (t) + 1 2 parenleftbig M 4 (t + 1) + M 4 (t − 1) parenrightbig − 2 parenleftbig M 5 (t + 1/2) + M 5 (t − 1/2) parenrightbig . These interpolating kernels are linear combinations of the B-splines defined by M n (t) = braceleftbigg summationtext ceilingleftn/2−|t|ceilingright j=0 (−1) j n(n/2−|t|−j) n−1 j!(n−j)! , |t|lessorequalslantn/2, 0, |t| >n/2, where ceilingleftxceilingright denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x. They can also be represented in terms of their Fourier transforms ˆ M n (w) = bracketleftbigg sinw/2 w/2 bracketrightbigg n ,w∈ R. Plots are shown in Fig. 2. M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 229 Fig. 2. Interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 ,andϕ 7 . Although Butzer et al. have discussed a wider class of functions, here we use only those with the interpolation property (see Ref. [9] for details). 3. Stability and Riesz bounds The set of integer translations of a B-spline generates a Riesz basis. In fact, the following result holds [10]. Theorem 1. For any function φ ∈ L 2 (R) and constants 0 <αlessorequalslantβ<∞ the following two statements are equivalent: (i) {φ(·−k): k ∈ Z} satisfies the Riesz condition with Riesz bounds α and β; that is, for any {c k }∈l 2 , α summationdisplay k∈Z |c k | 2 lessorequalslant vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble summationdisplay k∈Z c k φ(·−k) vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble vextenddouble 2 2 lessorequalslantβ summationdisplay k∈Z |c k | 2 . (ii) The Fourier transform ˆ φ of φ satisfies α lessorequalslant summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ φ(w + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 lessorequalslantβ, almost everywhere. The Riesz bounds corresponding to the B-splines and the linear combinations of B- splines used by Butzer et al. can now be found. Setting w = 2x and φ(w)= M n (w) we see 230 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 that summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M n (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle sin[(2x + 2πk)/2] (2x + 2πk)/2 vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle vextendsingle 2n = summationdisplay k∈Z sin 2n (x + πk) (x + πk) 2n = sin 2n x summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + πk) 2n , wherewehaveusedsin 2n (x + πk)= sin 2n x. It is known [11] that summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + πk) 2n =− 1 (2n − 1)! d 2n−1 dx 2n−1 cotx, which immediately yields summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M n (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 2n x (2n − 1)! d 2n−1 dx 2n−1 cotx. (2) Now, with the help of (2), we find for M 1 ˜ f 1 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 1 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 2 x (2 − 1)! d 2−1 dx 2−1 cotx = 1, (3) that is, α = β = 1. For M 2 we have ˜ f 2 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 2 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 4 x 3! d 3 dx 3 cotx = 1 3 parenleftbig 1 + 2 cos 2 x parenrightbig . (4) This equation has its minimum 1/3atx = π/2(orw = π), and its maximum 1 at x = w = 0, i.e., α = 1/3 and β = 1. Inthesameway, ˜ f 3 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 3 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 6 x 5! d 5 dx 5 cotx = 1 15 parenleftbig 2 + 11 cos 2 x + 2 cos 4 x parenrightbig . (5) The minimum is α = 2/15 and the maximum is β = 1. As for M 4 , we see that ˜ f 4 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 4 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 8 x 7! d 7 dx 7 cotx = 1 315 parenleftbig 17 + 180 cos 2 x + 114 cos 4 x + 4 cos 6 x parenrightbig , (6) yielding α = 17/315 and β = 1. M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 231 Finally, for M 5 we have ˜ f 5 (x) = summationdisplay k∈Z vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ M 5 (2x + 2πk) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = −sin 10 x 9! d 10 dx 10 cotx = 1 2835 braceleftbig 62 + 1072 cos 2 x + 1452 cos 4 x + 247 cos 6 x + 7 cos 8 x bracerightbig , (7) showing that α = 62/2835 and β = 1.

Plot of the periodic functions ˜ φ 1 , ˜ φ 2 , ˜ φ 6 ,and ˜ φ 7 , associated to the Riesz bases generated by the ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 ,andϕ 7 . To investigate the bounds associated with ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 we observe that, for odd integers p and q, summationdisplay k∈Z sin p (x + πk) (x + πk) p = sin p x braceleftbigg summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + 2kπ) p − summationdisplay k∈Z 1 [x + (2k + 1)π] p bracerightbigg , (8) and summationdisplay k∈Z cos q (x + πk)sin p (x + πk) (x + πk) p = cos q x sin p x braceleftbigg summationdisplay k∈Z 1 (x + 2kπ) p + summationdisplay k∈Z 1 [x + (2k + 1)π] p bracerightbigg .

With the help of (8) and (9) we get ˜ φ 2 (x) = 41 70 + 191 210 cos 2 x − 121 210 cos 4 x + 17 210 cos 6 x, (11) ˜ φ 6 (x) = 359 945 + 48 35 cos 2 x − 278 315 cos 4 x + 124 945 cos 6 x, (12) ˜ φ 7 (x) = 17 35 + 4016 2835 cos 2 x − 566 405 cos 4 x + 116 189 cos 6 x 368 8 32 10 − 2835 cos x + 2835 cos x. (13) M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 233 Figure 4 shows the plots of ˜ φ 1 , ˜ φ 2 , ˜ φ 6 , and ˜ φ 7 defined by (10), (11), (12), and (13), respectively. Note that the largest variation, 1 − α 1 ≈ 0.667, occurs for ˜ φ 1 and the smallest 1 − α 2 ≈ 0.414 for ˜ φ 2 . Table 1 summarizes the bounds, and shows that the linear combinations of B-splines ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 , lead to more stable representations than the B-splines M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , M 4 , and M 5 for equivalent polynomial spaces. Compare, for example, the bounds associated with M 5 and ϕ 7 , both of the 4th degree. 4. The spaces V ϕ Suppose that the spaces V a and V b are generated by ϕ a and ϕ b , respectively. It is known [3] that when the Riesz bounds of V a are tighter than those of V b , the representations pro- duced in V a are numerically more stable. This statement is clear when ϕ a and ϕ b generate the same space, i.e., V a = V b . In the more general case V a negationslash= V b the comparison is less straightforward. This will now be discussed. We note that already in [7] the authors considered the spaces generated by integer trans- lations of a generating function ϕ a , and linear combinations of the translations of the same generating function (what the authors call equivalent basis functions). Generally, when the sampling set T approaches zero, the approximation error bardblf − P V T f bardbl decreases. The Strang–Fix conditions [12] relate the approximation power of the representation to the spectral characteristics of the generating function: bardblf − P V T f bardbllessorequalslantC L T L bardblf (L) bardbl, ∀f ∈ W L 2 , where C L is a known constant and bardblf (L) bardbl= parenleftBigg 1 2π ∞ integraldisplay −∞ w 2L vextendsingle vextendsingle ˆ f(w) vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 parenrightBigg 1/2 . Here, W L 2 denotes the space of functions that are L times differentiable in the L 2 or finite- energy sense, and P V T f , as before, the orthogonal projection of f into V T . The error will decay like O(T L ), where the order of approximation is L = n + 1, and n the polyno- mial degree. Spline interpolation gives an identical error of approximation but a larger C L constant [13,14]. In our case, the spaces V ϕ ⊂ L 2 formed from the M i are all disjoint (the constant func- tion is not in L 2 ). Hence, they do not intersect and are not a subset of each other (for example, we cannot say that V M 1 ⊂ V M 2 or vice-versa). For ϕ 1 we have that ϕ 1 (t) = M 1 (t), that is, the spaces generated from the translations set of ϕ 1 and M 1 are equivalent, i.e., V ϕ 1 ≡ V M 1 . Now, suppose that ψ(t)= αM 3 (t) + βM 4 (t), for some fixed reals α and β. Suppose that for these values of α and β the Riesz bounds are better for V ψ than for V M 3 and V M 4 . Consider the projection of a signal f ∈ L 2 in V M 3 , V M 4 , and V ψ . Controlling T leads to approximations as good as necessary, but the representation in V ψ will remain the most stable. This is also the case when α = 4 and β =−3, that is, the approximation of a signal f ∈ L 2 will be numerically better in V ϕ 2 than in V M 3 or V M 4 . 234 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 A similar argument can be applied to the representations produced by the projections into V ϕ 6 , which are found to be more stable than the ones in V M 2 and V M 4 .Thesameis true for V ϕ 7 , in this case with respect to V M 4 and V M 5 . 5. The dual bases To complete this study, and in reference to Fig. 1, it remains to describe the dual func- tions of the interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 . For the B-splines, and according to (1), we find ˆ M ◦ 1 (w) = 2sin w 2 w , ˆ M ◦ 2 (w) = 12(1 − cos 2 w 2 ) w 2 (1 + 2 cos 2 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 3 (w) = 120 sin w 2 (1 − cos 2 w 2 ) w 3 (2 + 11 cos 2 w 2 + 2 cos 4 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 4 (w) = 5040(1 − 2 cos 2 w 2 + cos 4 w 2 ) w 4 (17 + 180 cos 2 w 2 + 114 cos 4 w 2 + 4 cos 6 w 2 ) , ˆ M ◦ 5 (w) = 90720 sin w 2 (1 − 2 cos 2 w 2 + cos 4 w 2 ) w 5 (62 + 1072 cos 2 w 2 + 1452 cos 4 w 2 + 247 cos 6 w 2 + 7 cos 8 w 2 ) . (14) See Fig. 5 for plots. As for the interpolation kernels ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ϕ 6 , and ϕ 7 we find Fig. 5.

(15) See Fig. 6. The expressions (14) and (15) define the frequency response of each analysis filter, or pre-filter, completing the framework of Fig. 1. 6. Conclusions For all practical purposes, signal representation procedures must be stable under small perturbations in the input data, and sometimes it is also desirable that the support of the interpolating kernel be as small as possible. This limits the truncation error, since only a 236 M.J.C.S. Reis et al. / Digital Signal Processing 15 (2005) 226–236 few coefficients contribute to the representation at any given point. The kernels that have been discussed meet both conditions. In the context of the sampling scheme described in [7], certain linear combinations of B-splines, already studied in a different context [9], lead to representations with tighter Riesz bounds than those generated by B-splines alone. Numerically, they therefore lead to more stable representations. References [1] C. de Boor, A Practical Guide to Splines, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978. [2] M.

Afreixo et al. / Digital Signal Processing 14 (2004) 523–530 the results can also be applied to other finite alphabets. The wide availability of such data, their volume and the interest of the applications have lead to a great deal of interest in methods for detecting and revealing structure such as short and long range correlations, periodicities, and so on. Fourier or linear transform analysis are among the natural tools for this task, but the symbolic nature of the data poses new challenges. It is true that Fourier analysis is possible and quite useful in finite fields and even in groups, Abelian or noncommutative. But even in these cases, the group structure provides an underlying algebraic framework that can be totally absent in the case of symbolic data. The computation of Fourier and other linear transforms of symbolic data, without as- suming any underlying algebraic structure, is a problem that has already been faced in the context of DNA data, and several apparently distinct and unrelated approaches exist. The simplest solution is to map each symbol to a number. The difficulty with this ap- proach is the dependence on the particular labeling adopted. Consider, for example, the following symbolic periodic sequence: s = (AT AGACAT AGAC ...). The mapping A mapsto→ 1, T mapsto→ 0, G mapsto→ 0, C mapsto→ 0, leads to a numeric sequence of period two, whereas the mapping A mapsto→ 1, T mapsto→ 2, G mapsto→ 3, C mapsto→ 4, yields period six. This clearly shows that some of the relevant harmonic structure can be hidden (or exposed) by the symbolic-to-numeric labelling. To achieve the required label invariance, each symbol s k can be assigned a vector v k pointing in one of four different directions [7]. Each vector can be expressed using an orthonormal basis in three-dimensional space. For each frequency, the sum of the squared modulus of the three corresponding Fourier coefficients provides a measure of spectral content with the required invariance properties [7]. It turns out that this can also be regarded as the Fourier transform of the inner-product autocorrelation of the vectors v k . Another approach is based on the symbolic autocorrelation concept. It can be defined in a very natural way and leads to a numerical sequence, the Fourier transform of which is the spectrum of the symbolic data. No hypothesis are necessary regarding the symbols. No algebraic structure or ordering needs to be imposed. Given two symbols, all that is necessary to know is whether they are equal or distinct. A symbolic sequence can also be represented using indicator sequences, that is, binary (zero/one) sequences that indicate the positions of the symbols in the symbolic sequence. The Fourier spectrum of each indicator sequence can be numerically computed, and the to- tal Fourier spectrum of the symbolic sequence is defined as the sum of the squared modulus of the individual indicator sequence spectra [9]. The concept of spectral envelope [8] provides yet another approach to the Fourier analy- sis of symbolic data. It is a symbolic to numeric mapping, optimized to emphasize any periodic feature present in the data. A modification of this concept to nonstationary data can be found in [10]. V. Afreixo et al. / Digital Signal Processing 14 (2004) 523–530 525 The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of methods for the Fourier analysis of symbolic data, such as DNA sequences, emphasizing their mutual connections. We show, for example, that the spectrum obtained using the symbolic autocorrelation is the sum of the squared Fourier transforms of the binary indicator sequences, which is computationally easier to obtain. We also show that precisely the same spectrum is obtained by adjusting a symbolic-to-numeric mapping, in such a way that the spectral energy at each frequency is maximized. This gives a unifying perspective on these Fourier analysis tools. 2. Methodologies We begin by introducing the notation and terminology used. Let s = (s k ) 0lessorequalslantk<n be a symbolic sequence over the alphabet {A,C,G,T }. Extension modulo n is implied when- ever necessary (hence, s k+n ≡ s k ). All sequences of length n, symbolic or numeric, are identified with column vectors of dimension n. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) X = (X i ) 0lessorequalslanti<n of the numeric sequence x = (x k ) 0lessorequalslantk<n is denoted by X = Fx, where F is the n × n Fourier matrix with elements F ab = e −j 2π n ab ,a,b= 0,1,...,n− 1. One has 〈x,x〉 =bardblxbardbl 2 = 1 n bardblXbardbl 2 , (1) where 〈x,y〉 = n−1 summationdisplay k=0 ¯x k y k = x prime y. Here, ¯x k is the conjugate of x k and x prime the conjugate transpose of x. With any symbolic sequence (s k ) 0lessorequalslantk<n over the alphabet {A,C,G,T } we associate four numeric (binary) indicator sequences u a k , u c k , u g k ,andu t k ,where0lessorequalslant k<n. These sequences identify the positions of each symbol, that is u a k = braceleftbigg 1,s k = A, 0,s k negationslash= A and similarly in the remaining three cases. We now turn to specific methods that have been used to perform Fourier analysis of symbolic data. 2.1. Indicator sequences The total spectrum of a symbolic sequence is often defined as the squared modulus of the DFTs of the indicator sequences, that is vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 vextendsingle g vextendsingle 2 vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 R i = vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle + vextendsingle U c i vextendsingle + vextendsingle U i vextendsingle + vextendsingle U t i vextendsingle (2) 526 V. Afreixo et al. / Digital Signal Processing 14 (2004) 523–530 with i ∈Z N . In the literature, the spectrum is sometimes identified, with little or no expla- nation, with this sum. Intuitively, the solution seems reasonable. No algebraic operations need to be defined on the symbols, and no symbolic-to-numeric mapping is needed. How- ever, the theoretical interpretation and meaning of this solution seems, at first glance, obscure. We now turn to the symbolic autocorrelation method, which allows a more satisfac- tory view of the indicator sequence approach. As we will see, under that formulation the spectrum (2) emerges as the Fourier transform of the symbolic autocorrelation. 2.2. Symbolic autocorrelation The simplest way of performing Fourier or any other transform analysis on a symbolic sequence is to map the symbols to numbers, and then process the sequence obtained. For example, one could start by finding the autocorrelation of the numeric sequence, and its Fourier transform [3,5]. This has disadvantages, as mentioned above. The mapping may either expose or hide some of the frequency information. Furthermore, there might be no biochemical meaning for the ordering and arithmetic structure that result from the symbolic to numeric mapping. A better approach is to derive the autocorrelation function directly from the symbols. By autocorrelation of the symbolic sequence (s k ) 0lessorequalslantk<n we mean the numeric sequence r k = n−1 summationdisplay i=0 d(s i ,s i+k ), where for any two symbols x and y d(x,y)= braceleftbigg 1,x= y, 0,xnegationslash= y. (3) This is related to the equal-symbol correlation measure introduced in [9]. The autocorrela- tion r k is a numeric sequence that can be rewritten in terms of the four indicator sequences, since u a k = d(s k ,A), u c k = d(s k ,C), and so on. Hence, r k =〈u a ,S k u a 〉+〈u c ,S k u c 〉+〈u g ,S k u g 〉+〈u t ,S k u t 〉, where the operator S k denotes a cyclic shift by k,thatis,S k u a = (u a m+k ) 0lessorequalslantm<n ,andsimi- larly in the remaining three cases. By (1), we have 〈u a ,S k u a 〉= 1 n n−1 summationdisplay i=0 vextendsingle vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 e −j 2π n ki and so r k = 1 n n−1 summationdisplay i=0 parenleftbigvextendsingle vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U c i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U g i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 parenrightbig e −j 2π n ki . We conclude that the DFT of the symbolic autocorrelation is the sum of the squared modu- lus of the DFTs of the indicator sequences. In other words, we obtain (2), the total spectrum using the indicator sequences. V. Afreixo et al. / Digital Signal Processing 14 (2004) 523–530 527 2.3. Spectral envelope The concept of spectral envelope was introduced in [8], and a variant for nonstationary data was discussed in [10]. For simplicity the presentation that follows is closer to [10], but considers the stationary case. The relations between the two approaches (and the sta- tionary/nonstationary case) will be discussed later. Consider the n × 4matrix u =[u a u c u g u t ] and the vector of real weights w =[acgt] T . The sequence z = uw then corresponds to the mapping A mapsto→ a, C mapsto→ c, and so on. The DFT of z is Z = Fz= Fuw= Uw, where U is the 4×n matrix obtained by concatenating the DFTs of the indicator sequences, U = Fu=[Fu a Fu c Fu g Fu t ]=[U a U c U g U t ]. Denoting by U i the ith line of U, we may write Z i = U i w,andso |Z i | 2 = w prime U prime i U i w = vextendsingle vextendsingle aU a i + cU c i + gU g i + tU t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 . (4) The idea underlying [8] and [10] is to adjust the symbolic-to-numeric mapping in such a way that the Z i become in some sense extremal. For each frequency i, select the vector w of unit norm that maximizes |Z i | 2 . That is, consider the problem max bardblwbardbl=1 |Z i | 2 = max bardblwbardbl=1 w prime U prime i U i w. The maximum of this Rayleigh quotient is λ max (U prime i U i ), the maximum eigenvalue of the Hermitian matrix U prime i U i . Furthermore, the weights w for which the maximum is achieved are given by w = U prime i bardblU i bardbl . As a result, max bardblwbardbl=1 |U i w| 2 = max bardblwbardbl=1 w prime U prime i U i w = vextendsingle vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U c i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U g i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = R i andsoweobtain λ max parenleftbig U prime i U i parenrightbig = vextendsingle vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U c i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U g i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 = R i . This reveals yet another way of looking at the total spectrum (2). We have seen that the sum of the squares of the DFTs of the four indicator sequences, at frequency i, is equal to the DFT of the symbolic autocorrelation, at frequency i.Nowweseethatitisalso related to the value of the DFT of a certain numerical sequence, again at frequency i.The 528 V. Afreixo et al. / Digital Signal Processing 14 (2004) 523–530 particular numerical sequence that leads to this spectrum corresponds to a symbolic-to- numeric mapping optimized to achieve the maximum squared magnitude for frequency i. One should note that in the nonstationary case, considered in [10], the matrix U prime i U i is averaged over several data segments, and the solution to the eigenproblem cannot be found as easily. On the other hand, if the averaging is not performed or if the data are stationary, the approach should lead to results close to (2), which might be easier to compute. We considered the Rayleigh quotient and the corresponding eigenvalue problem mainly for ease of comparison with the general approaches in [8,10]. Such an approach is not strictly necessary in the case discussed. To see this, apply the Cauchy inequality to (4), |Z i | 2 = vextendsingle vextendsingle aU a i + cU c i + gU g i + tU t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 lessorequalslant parenleftbig |a| 2 +|c| 2 +|g| 2 +|t| 2 parenrightbigparenleftbigvextendsingle vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U c i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U g i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 parenrightbig and then note that the condition for equality readily leads to the results. The spectral envelope was introduced by Stoffer [8] but depends on the concept of gen- eralized eigenvalue. To continue the discussion we need the following notation: λ(A,B) denotes a generalized eigenvalue for the problem Ax = λBx. We continue to use λ(A) in reference to the eigenproblem Ax = λx. Of course λ(A,I) = λ(A). The idea in [8] is to find the weights w that maximize the power or variance for each frequency, relative to the total variance V(w). This leads to a generalized eigenproblem, since the maximum is of the form max w prime A prime U prime i U i Aw w prime A prime VAw , where, for alphabets of size 4, A is 4 × 3 and can be taken as A = parenleftbigg I 3 0 parenrightbigg and I 3 is the 3 × 3 identity matrix. We thus seek λ max (A prime U prime i U i A,A prime VA).Foragiven frequency i, the spectral envelope represents the largest proportion of the total power that can be attributed to that frequency, among all possible symbolic-to-numeric mappings. It is helpful to compare λ max (A prime U prime i U i A,A prime VA), which appears in [8], with λ max (U prime i U i ), which is related to the total spectrum (2). To do that observe that, if D is a positive definite symmetric matrix, then D = SS prime with S non-singular, and λ k (C,D) = λ k (S −1 CS −T ,I)= λ k (S −1 CS −T ). It readily follows from Ostrowski’s theorem [4] that λ max (C)λ min (D −T )lessorequalslantλ max (C,D)lessorequalslantλ max (C)λ max (D −T ). Setting C = A prime U prime i U i A and D = A prime VA, and noting that λ max (A prime U prime i U i A) = λ max (U prime i U i ) − |U t i | 2 , we obtain upper and lower bounds for the required generalized eigenvalue, in terms of λ max (U prime i U i ) and consequently the total spectrum. 2.4. Reduction of the dimensionality The four indicator sequences are of course redundant, since u a + u c + u g + u t = 1 V. Afreixo et al. / Digital Signal Processing 14 (2004) 523–530 529 and so U a i + U c i + U g i + U t i = braceleftbigg N, i = 0, 0,inegationslash= 0. The total spectrum can therefore be obtained with three DFTs, rather than four. In fact, it is possible to work with three (x,y,z) nonredundant sequences, rather than with four redundant ones [1,6,7]. The assignments used in [1] are Amapsto→ parenleftbig 001 parenrightbig , C mapsto→ parenleftbigg − √ 2 3 √ 6 3 − 1 3 parenrightbigg ,Gmapsto→ parenleftbigg − √ 2 3 − √ 6 3 − 1 3 parenrightbigg , T mapsto→ parenleftbigg 2 √ 2 3 0 − 1 3 parenrightbigg . The connection with the indicator sequences is x = √ 2 3 (2u t − u c − u g ), y = √ 6 3 (u c − u g ), z = 1 3 (3u a − u t − u c − u g ). The equivalence between the method that relies on the indicator sequences, and those of re- duced dimensionality was shown in [2], for an arbitrary number of symbols. In the present case, we have 3 parenleftbigvextendsingle vextendsingle U a i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U c i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U g i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 + vextendsingle vextendsingle U t i vextendsingle vextendsingle 2 parenrightbig = braceleftbigg 4 parenleftbig |X i | 2 +|Y i | 2 +|Z i | 2 parenrightbig ,inegationslash= 0, 4 parenleftbig |X i | 2 +|Y i | 2 +|Z i | 2 parenrightbig − 1,i= 0. 3. Conclusion We have discussed several methods for the Fourier analysis of symbolic data, empha- sizing the case of DNA sequences (four-symbol alphabets). We considered the indicator sequence approach, the vector and the symbolic autocorrelation methods, and methods similar to the spectral envelope, that for each frequency optimize the symbolic-no-numeric mapping to emphasize any periodic data features. We discussed the equivalence or connections between these methods. We have shown that it is possible to define the autocorrelation function of symbolic data, under weak as- sumptions: basically we need to be able to tell if two symbols are equal or distinct. The autocorrelation is a numeric sequence, and its Fourier transform leads to the spectrum of the symbolic data. But we have shown that this spectrum can also be obtained by summing the squares of the Fourier transform of indicator sequences (zero/one sequences indicating the position of the symbols). We also examined the spectral envelope concept, which provides yet another interpretation of the spectrum. Among all symbolic-to-numeric mappings there is one that maximizes the spectral energy at each frequency, and leads to the spectrum. References [1] D.

More precisely, for any fixed bandwidth, it is possible to find finite energy signals f which at arbitrarily chosen times tii=1N possess arbitrarily prescribed amplitudes ai, i.e. which obey f(ti) = ai for i = 1,2,..., N where N is arbitrarily large. This paper investigates to which extent such superoscillating signals could be used for the fast transmission of information through low bandwidth channels. The main result is that for fixed noise level, arbitrary amounts of information can be compressed into arbitrarily short segments of signals of arbitrarily low bandwidth, without having to increase the level of the amplitudes which encode the information. The price to be paid is that, for fixed message size, the energy expense grows polynomially with the compression and that, for fixed compression, the energy expense grows exponentially with the message size.",

        "doc_abstract": "There are two natural orderings in signals: temporal order and rank order. There is no compelling reason to explore only one of these orderings, either in the discrete-time or in the continuous-time case. Nevertheless, the concept of rank order for continuous-time signals remains virtually unstudied, which is in striking contrast to the discrete-time case: ranked order discrete-time filters, of which the running median is the most common example, have been intensively studied for three decades. The dependence of these nonlinear systems on the order statistics of the input samples stands in contrast with the tapped delay line filter, which depends on temporal order only. However, continuous-time signals can also be meaningfully sorted: a fact that is explored in this paper to define and study the analog median filter and other ranked-order filters. The paper introduces the basic tools needed to analyze and understand these continuous-time nonlinear filters (the distribution function and the sorting) and presents some of their properties in a tutorial way. The analog median filter is defined in terms of the (unique) nonincreasing left-continuous sorting. More general filters can also be defined, including filters similar to α-trimmed mean filters and L fillers. These include filters that depend on one parameter and contain the running average and running median as special cases. The rate of convergence of the digital median filter to the analog median filter is discussed and related to the signal sampling period, the duration of the filter window, and the smoothness of the input signal. The paper introduces the concept of noise width and studies the effect of additive and multiplicative noise at the output of the analog median filter in terms of the noise width and the smoothness of the input signal.",

In this letter, we recall that the concepts of impulse and frequency response can be useless even for certain linear, time-invariant systems. We briefly discuss the role of time-invariance, commuting linear systems, and conditions under which they have common eigenfunctions. Then we exhibit a class of nonlinear, nonhomogeneous, time-varying systems that still have exponential eigenfunctions. This class contains homogeneous time-invariant systems, finite impulse response (FIR) filters and generalized feedforward filters as special cases, and it shows that the exponential eigenfunction property does not imply linearity, homogeneity, or time-invariance.",

It is shown that the Fourier transform of a band-limited function can he extended (as a weighted sum of translates) as a Stepanoff almost periodic function, to the whole frequency axis. This result leads to a generalized nonuniform sampling theorem which, unlike previous results, does not require the continuity of the Fourier transform of the sampled function, and is valid for finite-energy band-limited functions.",

The method is based on a set of linear equations Ax=b, where A is m/spl times/n, and b is a subset (of cardinal n) of the Fourier transform of the object (which has a total of N samples). We give exact and best possible approximate expressions for the determinant of A, when m=n. As a corollary, it is shown that the smallest eigenvalue of A in absolute value satisfies |/spl lambda//sub min/|/spl les/k(n)N/sup -(n-1)/2/ where k(n) (which is independent of N) is explicitly given. The magnitude of the smallest eigenvalue of A becomes increasingly small as N grows, even when the number of unknowns n remains constant. When m>n the singular values of A are studied, and related to the eigenvalues of the matrix of two other direct methods. As a result, the connection between the method and the other direct methods is clarified. © 1998 IEEE.",

The demand for faster processing has led to steadily increasing sampling rates, and as a result the behavior of the discrete filters as the sampling period tends to zero has become an important theoretical and practical issue. One way of solving the numerical problems that arise in the usual filter structures when the sampling period becomes small compared with the dynamics of the underlying physical processes is to resort to /spl delta/ operators instead of delay operators. Although the interrelations between the continuous and discrete lattice structures have been rarely studied, it is known that the /spl delta/ lattice naturally leads to a continuous form as the sampling rate increases. This paper addresses this point and establishes the rate of convergence of the discrete lattice filter to the continuous filter as a function of the sampling period or of the filter order. © 1998 IEEE.",

We show that the positions can be evaluated in O(n2) or even O(n log n) flops by solving a set of n linear equations and computing a FFT. The determination of n is part of the algorithm, whose stability is also briefly discussed. The values of the n incorrect pixels can then be estimated using any of the interpolation methods known.",

The problems are (i) a nonlinear band-limited finite-dimensional interpolation problem (ii) the problem of estimating a signal that is the superposition of a finite number of harmonics (iii) an error-control coding problem in the real field, and (iv) certain techniques that occur in algorithm-based fault tolerant computing.

New connections between this problem and sampling theory are exposed, but the method used departs radically from those commonly used to obtain sampling results since (i) it applies to signals that are not band-limited, and possibly even discontinuous (ii) the sampling knots (the centers of the radial-basis functions) need not be equidistant (iii) the basic approximation building block is the Gaussian, not the usual sinc kernel. The results given offer an answer to the following problem: how complex should a neural network be in order to be able to approximate a given signal to better than a certain prescribed accuracy?

We are motivated by the discrete, finite dimensional character of digital signals and images, which naturally leads to the study of the discrete counterpart of multiresolution analysis and wavelet series expansions in infinite dimensional spaces such as L2 and l2. In finite dimensional spaces, all computations can be performed using finite matrix operations. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the natural tool for the harmonic analysis in such spaces, in which the circular convolution operation plays a vital role. Recently, there has been interest in this problem which has lead to interesting and important works such as [1, 2]. However, our approach is distinct: in a sense, it is simpler and more independent of the well-known theory in L2.",

Ferreira1 Dep. de Electrica e Telecomunicaes/WESC, Universidade de Aveiro, 3810 Aveiro, Portugal Received 18 April 1996 Abstract It is shown that the set of fixed points of a non-expansive operator is either empty or closed and convex. Under rather general conditions this shows that the minimum nonn solution of an operator equation of the fonn x = Tx exists and is unique, provided that T is non-expansive. This holds in any strictly convex Banach space, a class of spaces that includes Hilbert spaces as particular case, and has consequences in signal and image reconstruction, as well as in other engineering applications. Keywords: Minimum norm solutions; Convexity; Linear equations; Non-expansive operators; Nonlinear equations; Fixed points 1. Introduction Briefly speaking, a fixed point of a linear or non- linear operator T is a solution of the equation x = Tx. The basic fixed point theorems are Banach's theorem [2,11] for contractive mappings, Brouwer's theo- rem [4,10,6,8] for continuous mappings in a finite- dimensional space, and Schauder's generalization [10] of Brouwer's theorem to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Many other results are discussed in [16,3]. These fixed point theorems are tools of great im- portance in signal and image reconstruction, tomogra- phy, telecommunications, interpolation, extrapolation, signal enhancement, filter design, among many oth- ers [14,5,12,13,17,18,15,9]. A quick glance through [ 14], for example, should convince any reader of the practical interest of the subject: many interesting prob- lems can be recast as fixed point problems. For example, let x be a signal of interest, and let y be a distorted version of x. Assume further that y and x are related by an operator equation y = Dx ( y might be the signal measured at the receiving end of a transmission system D, and x the transmitted signal). The problem is how to estimate x given y and the model D of the distortion that x underwent. If x satisfies a constraint equation x = Cx, then x ' Partially supported by JNICT. E-mail: pjf@inesca.pt. = Cx + /n(y - DCx), an identity of the form x = Tx. Under rather general conditions, the solution to this equation will be the unknown signal x. This is the key to many iterative constrained restoration algorithms -t:,+i = Cx, + /Ji(y - DCx,) = TXt, as described in [14]. Their analysis is easy if T is a contraction (Banach's theorem applies and guarantees 0165-1684/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Published by Eisevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PI! SO 165-1684(96)00160-0 138 P.J.S.G. Ferreira/Signal Processing 55 (1996) 137-139 the existence and uniqueness of the solution). If T is merely non-expansive2 , as it often is, the analysis of the problem is more complex. A non- expansive operator may have any number of fixed points, a fact that suggests the study of the minimum norm solutions of x = Tx. Brouwer's theorem and Schauder's theorem are among the results that ensure the existence of fixed points of non-expansive operators. In this paper we show that the set of fixed points of a non-expansive operator is either empty or closed and convex. This turns out to be true in all strictly convex Banach spaces, such as Lp (l < p < 00), and in particular in all Hilbert spaces, such as LT,. This easily shows the existence and uniqueness of the minimum norm solution of an operator equation of the form x = Tx, if T is non-expansive. 2. Convexity of the set of fixed points The set of fixed points of a given non-expansive mapping may contain any number of elements. For example, the translation T : f f + g has no fixed points at all. If g = 0 this changes drastically: T re- duces to the identity mapping, which is clearly non- expansive and for which every point in the domain is also a fixed point. In spite of this wide range of possibilities, there is a useful property that the set of fixed points of a non- expansive operator retains. Theorem 1. Let X be a strictly convex normed space with norm \\\\ ||. The set of fixed points of a non- expansive mapping T : X X is either empty or closed and convex. Proof. The example T : f -^ f + g shows that the set of fixed points can be empty. If there is only one fixed point there is nothing to show. Consequently, let x and y be two fixed points, and let z = ax + (1 a)y. We wish to show that z is also a fixed point. Consider the inequalities \\\\Tz - x\\\\ = ||7z - Tx\\\\ ^ ||z - x\\\\ = ( 1 - a) \\\\x - y\\\\, \\\\Tz-y\\\\=\\\\Tz-Ty\\\\^\\\\z-y\\\\=a\\\\x-y\\\\. Adding them together leads to \\\\Tz-x\\\\+\\\\Tz-y\\\\^\\\\x-y\\\\. But \\\\Tz-x\\\\+\\\\T!.-y\\\\^\\\\x-y\\\\, by the triangle inequality, which shows that \\\\Tz-x\\+\\\\Tz-y\\\\=\\\\x-y\\\\. Let a = x - 7z and b = Tz - y. Then this is ||a + b\\\\ = \\\\a\\\\ + \\\\b\\\\, and since the norm is strictly convex, a = Ab for some positive constant A (see [11, p. 336]). This means that Tz is a linear combination of x and y, that is, Tz = +( 1 - y for some real The previous results show that \\\\Tz - x\\\\ = ||z - x\\\\ = (1 - a)\\\\x - y||, (1) \\\\n-y\\\\=\\\\z-y\\\\=a\\\\x-y\\\\, and consequently = a, and 7z = z. D A geometrical interpretation of this result is given in Fig. 1. The sets A and B are defined by A={x:\\\\Tz-x\\\\^(a)\\\\x-y\\\\}, B={x:\\\\n-y\\\\^a\\\\x-y\\\\}. B 2 A linear or nonlinear operator T defined in a normed space X with norm || || is non-expansive if \\\\Tx - 7v|| ^ ||;r - y|| for all x.v e x. Fig. 1. Geometrical interpretation of Theorem 1. P.J.S.G. Ferreira/Signal Processing 55 (1996) 137-139 139 The image of z. by r must lie in the intersection of A and B, which reduces to the point z. Thus, Tz must coincide with z. Note that the theorem ceases to be true if the balls A and B are not strictly convex. Thus, the theorem does not hold in Banach spaces such as L), that are not strictly convex. It does hold in Lp, for 1 < p < oo, including Z-z, as well as any other Hilbert space. If the normed space X is a Hilbert space, its norm satisfies the parallelogram identity [11] ii^+ii^ii^M^ii&ir-, and the proof of the theorem becomes simpler. Taking a = 7z - x and b = z - x leads to ||Tz -zip-r-llrz -x+z -x\\\\1 ^IITz-xll^Hz-xll2, and using both ( 1 ) and the fact that T is non-expansive \\\\n-zf^4\\\\z-x\\\\2-\\\\n-Tx+z-x\\\\2 <i4\\\\z-xf-(]\\Tz-Tx\\\\+\\\\z-x\\\\)2 ^llz-.^-dlz-xll+llz-^)2, which means that ||7z - z|| =0 and consequently z = Fz. Theorem 2. Any non-empty closed convex subset S of a strictly convex Banach space contains a unique element of smallest norm. This is a well-known result and we omit the proof. In a Hilbert space, the proof again depends on the par- allelogram identity. In a strictly convex Banach space, it is a corollary a the uniqueness of best approxima- tions. See, for example, [ 11,7,1 ]. The presentation in [ 1 ] is based on the (equivalent) concept of a strictly normalized space. Corollary 3. Let S be a compact and convex subset of a strictly convex Banach space, and let T be a non- expansive mapping which carries S into itself. Then, the minimum-norm solution of x = Tx exists and is unique. Proof. By Theorem l, T has a non-empty and con- vex set of fixed points (Schauder's theorem shows that the set of fixed points is not empty). By Theo- rem 2, this set contains a unique element with mini- mum norm. D References f 1 ] N.I. Achieser, Theory of Approximation, Frederick Ungar, New York, 1956.

We discuss the applicability of techniques used in error correcting codes to this problem, and the possibility of determining the location of the erroneous samples in oversampled band limited signals. The method borrows ideas from error-correcting codes such as BCH codes, but works in the complex field rather than in a Galois field. This work complements works in reconstruction theory which usually assume that the positions of lost samples or pixels are known, and improves on previously reported nonlinear iterative algorithms.",

During the last years there has been a growing concern about the effect of landfills in public health, because leaching water can contaminate nearby aquifers. Hydrogeological studies are very important to investigate and remedy these contamination problems but an integrated use of both geophysical and hydrological methods can be even more effective. In this paper, the groundwater contamination by a landfill, located on very porous and permeable formations, is assessed by both geophysical and hydrogeological techniques. Bearing in mind the geological and hydrogeological characteristics of the area, electrical methods were chosen to carry out the geophysical survey. At first, electromagnetic methods were used and a ground conductivity survey was carried out to determine the contamination plume. Then several resistivity soundings were proposed and two resistivity pseudo-sections obtained so that a more detailed study of the contamination was accomplished. From the geophysical data interpretation, strategically located boreholes were drilled, water samples obtained and chemical analysis carried out. Finally, the overall results are integrated and discussed as well as the merits and disadvantages of the techniques that have been employed. © 1994.",

No assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the missing samples, in contrast with the often studied extrapolation problem, in which the known samples are grouped together. Indeed, it is possible to regard the observed signal as a sampled version of the original one, and to interpret the reconstruction result studied herein as a sampling result. We show that the iterative algorithm converges if the density of the sampling set exceeds a certain minimum value which naturally increases with the bandwidth of the data. We give upper and lower bounds for the error as a function of the number of iterations, together with the signals for which the bounds are attained. Also, we analyze the effect of a relaxation constant present in the algorithm on the spectral radius of the iteration matrix. From this analysis we infer the optimum value of the relaxation constant. We also point out, among all sampling sets with the same density, those for which the convergence rate of the recovery algorithm is maximum or minimum. For low-pass signals it turns out that the best convergence rates result when the distances among the missing samples are a multiple of a certain integer. The worst convergence rates generally occur when the missing samples are contiguous. © 1994 IEEE.",

The algorithms are similar to the discrete Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm and can be used to recover missing samples in finite-length records of band-limited data. They seem to perform satisfactorily well when used to interpolate ECG data, which normally has a relatively low bandwidth. We believe that they are useful tools for the reconstruction of partially known ECG segments, that is, segments in which a number of randomly distributed samples are unknown.",
