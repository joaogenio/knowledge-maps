An electronic search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. After the studies’ selection, 27 studies were included. The results show the interest in using context-aware features to develop smart cities’ applications targeting public health, tourism experience, urban mobility, active citizenship, shopping experience, management of urban infrastructures, public alerts, recommenders, and smart environments. Moreover, the applications reported by the included studies do not allow the execution of actions without the explicit consent of the users, and they integrate personal sensors, sensors deployed in the city and crowdsourcing mechanisms to acquire primary context attributes (i.e., location, activity, and environment) and secondary context attributes (i.e., speed, physical activity, points of interest, stress, and tourists’ emotions). In addition, the included studies present scarce details about context reasoning, data privacy, integrity, and confidentiality, data aggregation and accuracy, and data interoperability. Finally, the results also indicate low maturity level of the developed applications, which is evidenced by the lack of user-centred evaluations, as well as by the difficulty in integrating important technologies being developed for smart cities.",

Seventy-six articles were included in this mapping review. Most of the included articles (i.e., 65 articles) reported the implementation and validation of computerized versions of paper-based neuropsychological tests. In turn, 11 studies are related to the application of emerging technologies to detect cognitive decline, including serious games, virtual reality, and data analytics (e.g., algorithms to analyse data from ubiquitous daily activity and interaction sensing) approaches. From these 11 studies, four include experimental setups to determine if the developed digital solutions can discriminate cognitive impairments. Based on the mapping review findings is possible to conclude that further research is required to develop cognitive screening approaches alternative to computerized versions of paper-based neuropsychological tests.",

Materials and methods: Electronic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PEdro, Scielo, Scopus and Academic Search Complete (EBSCO host) for articles on measurement properties of self-report, proxy or observational instruments. Results: A total of 14 instruments were identified. Of these, 8 were self-report instruments, 4 were observational instruments and 2 could be used both as self-report or proxy-report. The quality of the manuscripts was inadequate or doubtful in 45.5%, adequate in 15.9% and very good in 38.6% of the cases. No instrument was assessed for all the properties recommended by COSMIN. The quality of the evidence for the measurement properties of the pain assessment instruments ranged from very low to moderate. Conclusions: There is scarce and low-quality evidence on the measurement properties of instruments used to assess pain in individuals with cerebral palsy. Further research is needed designed in line with the COSMIN recommendations.Implications for rehabilitation There is scarce and low-quality evidence on the measurement properties of instruments used to assess pain in individuals with cerebral palsy; Clinicians need to carefully choose instruments to assess pain in individuals with cerebral palsy as there is insufficient evidence on the quality of instruments; Self-report pain intensity scales may be a useful instrument for a subgroup of individuals with cerebral palsy.",

However, the percentage of older adults who comply with the recommendations for physical activity levels is low when compared to the same percentages on younger groups. The SmartWalk system aims to encourage older adults to perform physical activity (i.e., walking in the city), which is monitored and adjusted by healthcare providers for best results. The study reported in this article focused on the implementation of SmartWalk security services to keep personal data safe during communications and while at rest, which were validated considering a comprehensive use case. The security framework offers various mechanisms, including an authentication system that was designed to complement the pairs of usernames and passwords with trusted execution environments and token-based features, authorization with different access levels, symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, critical transactions review, and logging supported by blockchain technology. The resulting implementation contributes for a common understanding of the security features of trustful smart cities’ applications, which conforms with existing legislation and regulations.",

Although most of the included studies aimed the implementation of specific applications, these were still in an early stage of development, without the assessment of potential end-users. This is an important research gap since it makes difficult the creation of market-oriented solutions. Another research gap is the integration of knowledge generated by other research topics related to smart cities and smart mobility. Consequently, important issues (e.g., user privacy, data standardization and integration, Internet of Things implementation, and sensors’ characteristics) were poorly addressed by the included studies.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This article focuses on an eHealth application, CogniViTra, to support cognitive and physical training (i.e., dual-task training), which can be done at home with supervision of a health care provider. CogniViTra was designed and implemented to take advantage of an existing Platform of Services supporting a Cognitive Health Ecosystem and comprises several components, including the CogniViTra Box (i.e., the patient terminal equipment), the Virtual Coach to provide assistance, the Game Presentation for the rehabilitation exercises, and the Pose and Gesture Recognition to quantify responses during dual-task training. In terms of validation, a functional prototype was exposed in a highly specialized event related to healthy and active ageing, and key stakeholders were invited to test it and share their insights. Fifty-seven specialists in information-technologybased applications to support healthy and active ageing were involved and the results and indicated that the functional prototype presents good performance in recognizing poses and gestures such as moving the trunk to the left or to the right, and that most of the participants would use or suggest the utilization of CogniViTra. In general, participants considered that CogniViTra is a useful tool and may represent an added value for remote dual-task training.",

Introduction Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Huntingtonâ€™s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or frontotemporal dementia) represent a major threat to human health with impact both in terms of the individualâ€™s memory and cognition, as well as dysfunctions such as reduced speech rate, higher daily caloric intake, increased rigidity, reduced dexterity, essential tremors and even difficulties in breathing [1,2]. Being ageing the primary factor for most neurodegenerative diseases [3], their prevalence is increasing. Considering all major groups of diseases, those of the nervous system represent the greatest contribution to the global impact on the health of populations worldwide (i.e., 6.3%) and are responsible for the highest disability rates and global burden of disease [4]. Mild cognitive impairment, an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia, often goes undetected and its early identification is critical to delay its progress, to better manage further decline, and to guide therapeutic interventions and functional rehabilitation [5]. The clinical standard for cognitive assessment relies on an extensive evaluation of multiple cognitive domains by trained practitioners, using clinical instruments that screen for cognitive impairment, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). However, the application of these instruments is time and resource consuming and therefore not a practical solution for cognitive screening in the general population. To implement more effective solutions for screening the cognitive functioning of the individuals in the community, more accessible methods that can be implemented more frequently are needed to detect early signs of impairment. Computerized solutions to support neuropsychological tests have existed for several decades and might use different types of interaction devices, be it computers, handheld devices, or virtual reality [6]. Some software offers computerized versions of traditional cognitive tests (e.g., Trail Making Test) to evaluate specific cognitive domains (e.g., attention, executive functions, or memory) [7], while others, such as the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) or the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB), support the application of test batteries to assess multiple cognitive domains [8]. However, these digital solutions have been designed to mirror the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment batteries, applied by trained practitioners in a clinical setting and not for screening cognitive impairment in large populations. Considering the importance of the early detection of mild cognitive impairment, it is envisaged the development of new instruments able to monitor the individuals in their residential environments [6]. In this respect, multiple technologies have the potential to support new methods to screen for mild cognitive impairment and ultimately improve access to care [6,9]. By reproducing three-dimensional environments, virtual reality allows interactions comparable to experience a real-life setting and may help empower individuals to monitor their own cognitive performance [7]. Smart devices (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches, or smart-home devices) may collect data on individualsâ€™ habits and patterns, which can be analysed (e.g., using machine learning technologies [5]) to detect subtle changes that may indicate decline in cognitive performance [6]. Moreover, serious games allow alternative approaches to cognitive tests and may also reduce feelings of test anxiety [10]. The scoping review presented in this article aims to provide systematic evidence of state-of-the-art solutions for cognitive monitoring of older adults in their residential environments, which is useful to older adults, practitioners, and researchers. 2. Materials and Methods The objective of this scoping review was to identify innovative digital solutions to detect cognitive impairments and that might be used as a screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of community-dwelling older adults and was informed by the following research questions: ï‚· What are the approaches being used to develop digital solutions that might be used as a screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of older adults in their residential environments?

The scoping review presented in this article aims to provide systematic evidence of state-of-the-art solutions for cognitive monitoring of older adults in their residential environments, which is useful to older adults, practitioners, and researchers. 2. Materials and Methods The objective of this scoping review was to identify innovative digital solutions to detect cognitive impairments and that might be used as a screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of community-dwelling older adults and was informed by the following research questions: ï‚· What are the approaches being used to develop digital solutions that might be used as a screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of older adults in their residential environments? 958 Rute Bastardo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 956â€“963 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 ï‚· What types of methods are being used to assess the adequacy of the reported digital solutions? To perform the scoping literature review, the authors defined a review protocol with explicit descriptions of the steps to be taken, which are briefly described below. The resources chosen for the review were three electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline). Queries were prepared to include all the articles that have their titles, abstract or keywords conform with the following Boolean expression: (â€˜cognitive screeningâ€™ OR â€˜cognitive testâ€™ OR â€˜memory screeningâ€™ OR â€˜memory testâ€™ OR â€˜attention screeningâ€™ OR â€˜attention testâ€™) AND (â€˜computerâ€™ OR â€˜gameâ€™ OR â€˜gamingâ€™ OR â€˜virtualâ€™ OR â€˜onlineâ€™ OR â€˜internetâ€™ OR â€˜mobileâ€™ OR â€˜appâ€™ OR â€˜digitalâ€™). The expressivity of the search procedure depends on the database. As an example, the query expression to retrieve articles from the Scopus database was the following: TITLE-ABS-KEY((â€œcognitive screeningâ€� OR â€œcognitive testâ€� OR â€œmemory screeningâ€� OR â€œmemory testâ€� OR â€œattention screeningâ€� OR â€œattention testâ€�) AND (computer OR game OR virtual OR online OR internet OR mobile OR app OR digital)). The electronic literature search was performed in January 2021 and included all references published before December 31, 2020. In terms of inclusion criteria, the references were included if: ï‚· Full-text manuscripts. ï‚· Report on any independent digital solution that might be used as a generic self-administrated screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of community-dwelling older adults. ï‚· Describe the proposed digital solution. ï‚· Report an evaluation involving end-users. ï‚· Are written in English. In turn, considering the exclusion criteria, references were excluded if they report on any digital solution that: ï‚· Is intended to be used as a cognitive monitoring tool over time for patients that have been diagnosed with any neurological condition. ï‚· Was designed and evaluated considering a specific health condition. The analysis and selection of the articles were performed in three steps: ï‚· First step - the authors removed the duplicates, the references without abstract and that were not written in English. ï‚· Second step - the authors assessed all titles and abstracts for relevance and those clearly not meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were removed. ï‚· Third step - the authors then assessed the full text of the remaining articles against the outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria and the final list of the articles to be considered for the review was created. Throughout this entire process, each article was analysed by three authors and any disagreement between the authors was discussed and resolved by consensus. Concerning data extraction, the following information was registered in a data sheet prepared by the authors for each of the articles included in the review: i) the demographics of the published work (i.e., authors, year, or source of publication); ii) the scope of the article; iii) the purpose of the digital solutions being reported; iv) characterization of the participants; and v) details of the assessment of the reported digital solution. 3. Results A total of 7570 articles was retrieved from the initial search of the selected databases. The first step yielded 3991 articles, since 3579 articles were removed because they i) were duplicated (i.e., 3283 articles), ii) their abstracts were missing (i.e., 160 articles), or iii) were not written in English (i.e., 136 articles). 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 During the second step, one article was excluded because it was retracted, and 3887 were removed because they did not meet the outlined inclusion criteria. Finally, also considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, during the full text analysis (i.e., the third step) 84 articles were removed due to the following reasons: i) reported on solutions that are intended to be applied by clinicians and not to be self-administered (e.g. [11]); ii) were designed or evaluated for specific health conditions (e.g., [12]); or iii) it was not possible to infer the technological solution used as details are not reported (e.g., [13,14]). Therefore, 19 articles were included for this scoping review [15-33]. Two of the articles [21,25] report different studies but the same digital solution (i.e., the Brain on Track). Two of the included articles were published in conference proceedings [16,28] and the remainder were published in scientific journals. In terms of publication year, the included articles were published between 2011 (i.e., one article [15]) and 2020 (i.e., five articles [29,30,31,32,33]). However, almost 85% of the articles (i.e., [18-33]) were published in the last five years and more than half of the articles (i.e., [24-33]) were published in the past two years. 3.1. Development Approaches The included studies report on the use of various types of digital solutions (i.e., web-based portal assessed by personal computers [17,19,21,25], mobile devices, namely tablets [18,23,29,31,32], smartphones [22, 24,28], tablets and smartphones [16,30], or smartwatches [27,33], and virtual reality set-ups [15,20,26]) to provide: ï‚· Computerized versions of cognitive tests to evaluate specific cognitive domains [22,27,29,33], namely attention (i.e., Trail Making Test), executive functions (i.e., Simple and Complex Reaction Time), and memory (e.g., N- Back Memory tests) (Table 1). ï‚· Computerized solutions of new (i.e., Memoro [17], NutriNet-SantÃ© Cognitive Test Battery - NutriCog [19], and Computer-Based Dementia Assessment Contents - Co-Wis [31]) or existing (i.e., Mini-Cog [16], MMSE [24,28], Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination - SAGE [30], and Identification and Intervention for Dementia in Elderly Africans - IDEA [32]) test batteries to assess multiple cognitive domains (Table 2). ï‚· New approaches to assess cognitive functions including virtual reality [15,20,26] and serious games [18,21,23,25] (Table 3). In terms of technological features, one article [16] refers to the implementation of handwriting recognition to support the interpretation of Clock Drawing Test of the Mini-Cog test battery using a touch screen and speech recognition to support cognitive tasks that require the identification of words. Another article [29] also reports on the existence of speech recognition to allow voice interaction in the application of cognitive tests. In turn, machine learning algorithms were used in one study [31] to classify the cognitive performance of the participants for the identification of cognitive impairments. Finally, in terms of the use of sensors, one article [33] refers to the possibility of using data collected by sensors but a concrete solution is not presented, while in another study [30], data collected by built-in sensors of smartphones were used to measure hand tremor and energy expenditure, which together with speech analysis features were used to complement the cognitive impairment evaluation using the SAGE test battery. 3.2. Validation Considering the objectives of the user-centred assessments being reported, four different classes were identified (Table 4): i) studies aiming to assess the usability of the proposed digital solutions; ii) studies aiming to evaluate the feasibility of the concepts being proposed; iii) studies aiming to validate digital solutions to support tests to assess specific cognitive domains or to support test batteries to assess multiple cognitive domains; and iv) studies aiming to evaluate whether the proposed digital solutions are able to identify individuals with cognitive impairment.

In some studies, the aiming is to develop digital versions of tests being used to assess specific cognitive functions while in other studies the focus is to provide digital solutions to support the application of test batteries to assess multiple cognitive functions.

Finally, in what concerns memory assessment, it was possible to identify digital versions of the Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (one study [29]), the Verbal Memory test (one study [22]), the Stroop test (two studies [22,33], with two different technological approaches, since in the study reported by [22] the user interaction is based on smartphones, while in the study reported by [33] it is based on smartwatches), and the N-Back Memory Tests (three studies [22,27,33], also with different types of user interaction: smartphones [22] and smartwatches [27,33]). In turn, considering studies aiming to provide digital solutions to support the application of test batteries to assess multiple cognitive functions, seven batteries were identified: Mini-Cog [16], MMSE [24,28], SAGE [30], IDEA [32], Rute Bastardo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 956â€“963 961 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 Table 1.

Discussion and Conclusion Concerning the first research question (i.e., what are the approaches being used to develop digital solutions that might be used as a screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of older adults in their residential environments?), the results show that the great majority of the included articles aimed to propose digital solutions to support the application of existing paper-based instruments that are being used in clinical settings. In some studies, the aiming is to develop digital versions of tests being used to assess specific cognitive functions while in other studies the focus is to provide digital solutions to support the application of test batteries to assess multiple cognitive functions.

Looking for specific cognitive functions, article [22] proposes a digital version of the traditional paper-based Trail Making Test, a cognitive test to assess attention. In terms of executive functions, two studies [22,33] presented digital versions of the Sample and Complex Reaction Time Test (with differences in terms of user interaction: smartphones [22] and smartwatches [33]). Finally, in what concerns memory assessment, it was possible to identify digital versions of the Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (one study [29]), the Verbal Memory test (one study [22]), the Stroop test (two studies [22,33], with two different technological approaches, since in the study reported by [22] the user interaction is based on smartphones, while in the study reported by [33] it is based on smartwatches), and the N-Back Memory Tests (three studies [22,27,33], also with different types of user interaction: smartphones [22] and smartwatches [27,33]). In turn, considering studies aiming to provide digital solutions to support the application of test batteries to assess multiple cognitive functions, seven batteries were identified: Mini-Cog [16], MMSE [24,28], SAGE [30], IDEA [32], 962 Rute Bastardo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 956â€“963 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 Memoro [17], Nutri-Cog [19], and Co-Wis [31]. The first five correspond to digital versions of existing paper-based batteries, while the last three were specifically developed to be used in digital format. It is worthwhile to mention that the adaptation to digital format of the MMSE battery was the objective of two studies using smartphones for the user interaction [24,28]. Finally, the studies reported by seven articles [15,18,20,21,23,25,26] aimed to develop new approaches to assess cognitive functions supported in virtual reality [15,20,26] and serious games [18,21,23,25]. In terms of virtual reality, [15] mimicked tests to assess specific cognitive domains, [20] assessed reactions to visual stimulus and [26] assessed the performance of executing activities that are replications of daily living activities. Looking for serious games, one study [18] presented a gamification version of an executive function test (i.e., Go/No-Go Discrimination Task), other study [23] proposed new exercises to test executive functions, and two studies [21,18] proposed exercises to test multiple cognitive functions. The reported digital solutions already endowed with a certain degree of development, as evidenced by the reported evaluations. In terms of methods are being used to evaluate the adequacy of the reported digital solutions (i.e., the second research question), the included articles aim to achieve different goals: i) usability evaluation [16,24,28,33]; ii) feasibility evaluation [20,22,30]; iii) validation of digital solutions to assess specific cognitive domains or to assess multiple cognitive domains [15,17-19,27,31]; and iv) evaluation if the proposed digital solutions are able to identify individuals with cognitive impairment [21,23,25,26,29,32]. The seven studies aiming to validate independent digital solution that might be used as a generic self-administrated screening tool for age related cognitive impairment presented different solutions, including digital versions of tests to assess specific cognitive domains [29], a test battery to assess multiple cognitive domains [32], virtual reality [26] and serious games [21,23,25]. All these seven studies included observational trials involving samples, between 60 [26] and 466 [32] of adults (aged over 18 years [21,25], over 50 years [23,29] or over 65 years [26,32]) with or without cognitive impairment. In turn, when compared to clinical standards (i.e., MoCA and MMSE [21,25,26], MoCA [23], Alzheimer biomarkers [29], and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) together with GDS [32]) the proposed solutions showed good discrimination capacity. From this scoping review it is possible to conclude that the number of included studies is not very representative within the total of studies. Particularly, during the selection of the articles to be included in the review a significant number of articles were excluded because evaluations involving end-users were not reported (i.e., one of the inclusion criteria), which denotes lack of maturity. Moreover, it is also possible to confirm an interest to use information technologies such as virtual reality or serious games to support the cognitive screening of older adults in their residential environments. In this respect, it should be referred that among the six studies aiming to assess if the proposed digital solutions are able to identify individuals with cognitive impairment, four (i.e., two thirds) report the use of virtual reality and serious games. Despite some limitations about both the chosen search keywords and the databases that were used for the identification of the articles, in this scoping review the authors followed rigorous procedures for retrieving, selecting, and analysing the articles, to guarantee the reliability of the results.

Since early identification of mild cognitive impairment is critical to better manage further decline, and to guide therapeutic and rehabilitation interventions, there is the need for efficient clinical instruments able to monitor the individuals, particularly older adults, in their residential environments. This paper presents a scoping review to identify of innovative digital solutions to detect cognitive impairments and that might be used as a screening tool for age related cognitive impairment of community-dwelling older adults. Nineteen articles were included in this scoping review. As a main conclusion, most of the included articles report digital solutions to support the application of existing paper-based clinical instruments to assess specific or multiple cognitive functions. However, six studies explore new approaches to assess cognitive functions including virtual reality and serious games.

Introduction Waiting times in hospital emergency services are sometimes considerably high, contributing to poor patient outcomes, and poor patient and family experiences [1,2]. Possible contributions for high waiting times in the emergency services include an overall increase in patient volume and rise complexity and acuity of the clinical situations, and the lack of infrastructures [3,4], including short age of nursing and administrative staff, limited physical space, and restrictions in terms of beds for patientsâ€™ admission. Moreover, organizational issues also contribute for the waiting times in the emergency services, including ineffective communication [5], delays in receiving results from medical imaging, laboratory and ancillary services, and complexity of medical record documentation [4]. The crowding of emergency services effects the care of patients with acute cerebrovascular accident (stroke). The first hours after the onset of symptoms are essential for the treatment, which means that there is a time window that allows the clinical procedures to be effective [6]. This means that the action of the healthcare professionals must be optimized and a sequence of diagnostic tests, imaging studies, and interventions must be accomplished in an efficient and timely manner [7,8], which has motivated several studies to evaluate the acute stroke care management [8-10]. Medical imaging workflows are supported by several information systems, including Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, Radiological Information Systems (RIS), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), and, in some cases, Teleradiology systems [11-13]. Much of the pertinent information related to the stroke patients is distributed by these various information systems, so their database are very relevant data resources for the optimization of the care processes over time [14,15]. The research study reported by this paper aimed to identify possible features to include in the emergency services information systems to improve the contribution of the medical imaging within acute stroke diagnosis and treatment. For that, the authors characterized the medical imaging procedures being performed in the context of acute stroke diagnosis and treatment of an emergency service of a Portuguese medium-size hospital and analyzed medical imaging studies data to identify points of improvement. The analysis highlighted the need to create alert mechanisms that might be based on data already available in the existing information systems. Finally, semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather the opinions of a group of healthcare professionals experienced in pre- and in-hospital emergency services about the feasibility of adding new alert mechanisms to the existing information systems, aiming to improve the care of patients with suspicious of acute stroke. Five sections compose this paper: the section two is based on a literature review and analysis current research related to the optimization of emergency services to guarantee the time window required for acute stroke diagnosis and treatment.

Background According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is a focal or global neurological impairment, of vascular origin, which can lead to death, caused by an interruption of blood supply to the brain [16]. In the world, it is estimated that 15 million people suffer a stroke each year, and of those, six million do not survive [17], which justifies the worldwide concern of improvement of the care of acute stroke patients. Stroke remains among the leading causes of long-term disability due to the countless physical, mental, and social sequelae [10,18]. Reperfusion therapies have revolutionized the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and they present significant improvement in mortality and functional outcomes [10,19,20]. However, the benefits of reperfusion therapies are clearly time-dependent: the possibility of achieving a favorable outcome among patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis compared to placebo, decreases with the increase of delays in the treatment [21]. Thus, reducing the onset-to-treatment time it is of paramount importance [21]. In this respect, the guidelines for early management of acute ischemic stroke of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommend the administration of reperfusion therapies within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and within one hour of arrival at a hospital [22].

Introduction Waiting times in hospital emergency services are sometimes considerably high, contributing to poor patient outcomes, and poor patient and family experiences [1,2]. Possible contributions for high waiting times in the emergency services include an overall increase in patient volume and rise complexity and acuity of the clinical situations, and the lack of infrastructures [3,4], including short age of nursing and administrative staff, limited physical space, and restrictions in terms of beds for patientsâ€™ admission. Moreover, organizational issues also contribute for the waiting times in the emergency services, including ineffective communication [5], delays in receiving results from medical imaging, laboratory and ancillary services, and complexity of medical record documentation [4]. The crowding of emergency services effects the care of patients with acute cerebrovascular accident (stroke). The first hours after the onset of symptoms are essential for the treatment, which means that there is a time window that allows the clinical procedures to be effective [6]. This means that the action of the healthcare professionals must be optimized and a sequence of diagnostic tests, imaging studies, and interventions must be accomplished in an efficient and timely manner [7,8], which has motivated several studies to evaluate the acute stroke care management [8-10]. Medical imaging workflows are supported by several information systems, including Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, Radiological Information Systems (RIS), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), and, in some cases, Teleradiology systems [11-13]. Much of the pertinent information related to the stroke patients is distributed by these various information systems, so their database are very relevant data resources for the optimization of the care processes over time [14,15]. The research study reported by this paper aimed to identify possible features to include in the emergency services information systems to improve the contribution of the medical imaging within acute stroke diagnosis and treatment. For that, the authors characterized the medical imaging procedures being performed in the context of acute stroke diagnosis and treatment of an emergency service of a Portuguese medium-size hospital and analyzed medical imaging studies data to identify points of improvement. The analysis highlighted the need to create alert mechanisms that might be based on data already available in the existing information systems. Finally, semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather the opinions of a group of healthcare professionals experienced in pre- and in-hospital emergency services about the feasibility of adding new alert mechanisms to the existing information systems, aiming to improve the care of patients with suspicious of acute stroke. Five sections compose this paper: the section two is based on a literature review and analysis current research related to the optimization of emergency services to guarantee the time window required for acute stroke diagnosis and treatment. Sections three and four respectively present the methods and the results of the study reported by this paper. Finally, section five is devoted to the discussion of the results and to draw a conclusion. 2. Background According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is a focal or global neurological impairment, of vascular origin, which can lead to death, caused by an interruption of blood supply to the brain [16]. In the world, it is estimated that 15 million people suffer a stroke each year, and of those, six million do not survive [17], which justifies the worldwide concern of improvement of the care of acute stroke patients. Stroke remains among the leading causes of long-term disability due to the countless physical, mental, and social sequelae [10,18]. Reperfusion therapies have revolutionized the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and they present significant improvement in mortality and functional outcomes [10,19,20]. However, the benefits of reperfusion therapies are clearly time-dependent: the possibility of achieving a favorable outcome among patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis compared to placebo, decreases with the increase of delays in the treatment [21]. Thus, reducing the onset-to-treatment time it is of paramount importance [21]. In this respect, the guidelines for early management of acute ischemic stroke of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommend the administration of reperfusion therapies within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and within one hour of arrival at a hospital [22]. 608 LÃ­gia Fernandes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 606â€“614 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 As a result, given the prevalence of stroke, one of the most important quality indicators of health care is the percentage of patients with stroke who receive timely treatment. The optimization of this indicator is dependent on the management of an important set of barriers. The first barrier to stroke treatment is the accurate and timely recognition of the onset of stroke symptoms. Since most patients experience symptoms in the community and not in a medical setting, this may represent the greatest delay in some cases [8]. Implementing strategies to address this barrier falls within the responsibilities of public health (e.g., to increase lay peopleâ€™s awareness of stroke) and, therefore, it is important to educate general population on common stroke presentations and how to effectively activate emergency medical services [8]. Once the patient arrives at the hospital, efforts are necessary to streamline in-hospital sequence of diagnostic tests, imaging studies, and interventions pathways [21]. However, this sequence requires the cooperation of multiple specialties into interdisciplinary teams, and adequate infrastructures, including the ones of the medical imaging services, which means that effective stroke treatment must be systematically planned to optimize workflows and maximize expeditious treatment with an emphasis on communication and teamwork [8,21]. Different strategies and protocols that affect emergency services response and coordination of patient presentation to the hospital have been shown to reduce delay times. A key to factor is the ability to fulfill multiple tasks while the patient may be otherwise occupied or in transit. These include prenotification, rapid triage protocols, rapid realization of laboratory and medical imaging evaluations, prompt feedback, and a dedicated interdisciplinary â€œstroke codeâ€� team with members from emergency medicine, neurology, and medical imaging to expedite diagnoses and treatments [8,23]. The comprehensive nature of these strategies requires an institution-wide culture of active quality improvement, and emergency services should seek out opportunities for continuous improvement, namely by gaining knowledge about best practices [8]. The research related to the optimization of the medical imaging services in the acute stroke treatment is extensive but focused on process-specific (e.g., using process mining [24] to enhance the clinical pathway [24]) and patient- specific factors. However, recent studies focused on how operational environments of care, including the crowding of emergency services, may affect the management of acute stroke patients [9]. Long waiting times related to a large flow of patients in need of care are also a common problem in medical imaging services [25]. The lack of response capacity of medical imaging services in carrying out the request of the emergency services can have a significant impact on patientsâ€™ waiting times [6]. Since inefficient management of workflows generates inefficient responsiveness in the provision of healthcare [26], the use of software tools to manage workflows might allow the balancing of workloads and can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the available medical imaging services [27]. In Portugal, given the relevance of a rapid provision of care to victims of stroke in the acute phase, it was implemented in 2005 a stroke code mechanism at the national level, the Stroke Green Way (SGW) [28]. It intends to be a coordinated strategy to improve the referral and treatment of emerging patients with a suspicious stroke clinical condition, in the pre-hospital, intra-hospital and inter-hospital phases [29]. Until the year 2020, more than 38 thousand patients were able to benefit from the SGW for a better and faster treatment [26]. In the presence of any of the stroke warning signs, the patient, or whoever watches the occurrence, should immediately contact the European Emergency Number 112. According to the regulations and guidelines, after contact with 112, the Urgent Patients Orientation Center (Centro de OrientaÃ§Ã£o de Doentes Urgentes â€“ CODU) must confirm the suspicion of stroke, activate the stroke code and the emergency transport [30]. Referral from the CODU must be directed to the emergency service of the nearest hospital with a specialized SGW team. In a hospital emergency, the SGW team must provide immediate attendance, perform the ABC assessment (i.e., A - Airway maintenance with cervical spine control, B â€“ Breathing, and C - Circulation with haemorrhage control), and confirm the acute stroke diagnosis, including review of the time and circumstances of symptom onset, previous medical history, general and neurological objective examination, as well as the quantification of the neurological impact, using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [30]. Regarding the use of complementary means of diagnosis, those normally used refer to i) medical imaging, ii) electrocardiogram (ECG), and iii) laboratory evaluation, namely blood count with platelets, coagulation study and blood glucose. In turn, the medical imaging evaluation may include Head Computed Tomography (Head CT) and Angio Computed Tomography (Angio CT) [31]. In general, the EHR systems are connected to the RIS, so that the later systems present an update list of the medical imaging studies being requested. Moreover, the results of the imaging studies carried out are stored in the PACS. 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 When an acute stroke is suspected, computed tomography studies must be analyzed by a neuroradiologist. As hospitals often lack neuroradiologists, Teleradiology systems have been adopted to allow neuroradiologists to remotely access imaging studies (stored in PACS) to be able to carry out their reports. Whatever the option, in person or remote, the reports produced by neuroradiologists are stored in the RIS. 3. Methods Considered the objective of the study reported by this paper (i.e., identifying features to include in the emergency services information systems to improve the medical imaging services within acute stroke diagnosis and treatment), a mixed method research was performed: â€¢ Processes mapping techniques [32] were applied to understand the operation of medical imaging services to support acute stroke care in a medium-size Portuguese hospital. Mapping techniques allow both the analysis of workflows already implemented and their restructuring, as well as the identification of new workflows in order to determine all stages and decisions of a process so that it can be continuously improved [3,25,33]. â€¢ The existence of multidisciplinary protocols when performing medical imaging studies in the context of acute stroke seems to contribute to the reduction of response time, providing an improvement in clinical results [34]. Therefore, data related to medical imaging studies were used to characterize the procedures being performed, as well as to identify points of improvement. â€¢ Semi-structured interviews were conducted involving a group of health care professionals with experience in pre- and intra-hospital emergency services. The interviews aimed at identifying the needs that can be satisfied with innovative solutions based on information technologies and to assess the viability to introduce additional features in the information systems supporting the emergency services. The research study reported by this paper was authorized by the board of directors of the selected medium-size hospital after being approved by the respective ethics committee. The anonymity of the healthcare professionals and patients involved in the study was fully guaranteed. 4. Results 4.1. Processes Mapping In the scope of healthcare services, processes mapping (i.e., an exercise to identify all stages and decisions of a process so that it can be continuously improved [33]) is important as good processes tend to be translated into an overall improvement in the provision of healthcare [35]. On the other hand, processes mapping allows to understand the reality of the services through the description of their functionality and workflows management [36]. Moreover, the use of modelling and simulation tools for workflows allows both the analysis of workflows already implemented and their restructuring, as well as virtual simulation of new workflows [3,25]. Since the stroke imaging evaluation may include Head CT and Angio CT, the authors performed the mapping of the processes and information systems used to support the carry out of Head CT studies and Angio CT studies. Therefore, two processes were considered (Fig. 1): â€¢ P1 - Head CT process characterized by the time interval elapsed from the moment the study is requested and the moment it is validated in the RIS, that is, when the medical report is available (Figure 1). â€¢ P2 - Angio CT Process characterized by the time interval between the moment when the Head CT study is performed and the end of the Angio CT study (including images post-processing). The Head CT process (P1) was divided into: LÃ­gia Fernandes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 606â€“614 609 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 As a result, given the prevalence of stroke, one of the most important quality indicators of health care is the percentage of patients with stroke who receive timely treatment.

The Head CT process (P1) was divided into: 610 LÃ­gia Fernandes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 606â€“614 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 â€¢ P1.1 - Patient transport to the imaging department: time interval elapsed from the moment the Head CT is requested, and the moment the study starts on the CT equipment, which might be obtained by the field [Routine Study Requisition Time] of the RIS and the field [Routine Study Requisition Time] of the PACS. â€¢ P1.2 - Perform Head CT: time interval between the beginning of the acquisition of images on the equipment and the closure of the study at RIS, which might be obtained by the field [Routine Study Execution Time] of the RIS and the field [Routine Study Acquisition Time] of the PACS. â€¢ P1.3 - Head CT reporting execution: time interval elapsed between the moment of study archive completion at the Teleradiology system and the study validation moment at the RIS, which might be obtained by the field [Routine Study Validation Time] of the RIS and the field [Teleradiology Storage Time] of the Teleradiology system. â€¢ P1.4 - Head CT Report Validation: time interval elapsed between the moment of the study execution and its validation at the RIS (i.e., the moment when the report is obtained), which might be obtained by the field [Routine Study Validation Time] and the field [Routine Study Execution Time] of the RIS. In turn, the Angio CT process (P2) was further divided into: â€¢ P2.1 - Angio CT decision time: time interval that elapses between the execution of Head CT and the request of an Angio CT, which might be obtained by the field [Angio CT Study Requisition Time] and the field [Routine Study Execution Time] of the RIS. â€¢ P2.2 - Angio CT procedure: time interval that elapses between the start of image acquisition from Angio CT and the completion the post-processing of the images, which might be obtained by the field [Angio CT Post Processing Time] and the field [Angio CT Study Acquisition Time] of the PACS. 4.2. Characterization of the Processes One of the aspects to be highlighted is the fact that within of the acute stroke diagnosis and treatment several information systems are used (i.e., HIS, EHR, RIS and PACS and the Teleradiology system). This distributed nature of information systems makes it difficult to identify situations of delay in the different SGW processes. In turn, data fields belonging to RIS, PACS and Teleradiology systems can be used to characterize the process and sub-processes associated to medical imaging workflow, namely in the context of suspected stroke in the acute phase. Head CT studies carried out over a year on patients with suspected stroke, integrated into the hospital SGW, were analyzed in the period from August 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018, aiming to identify the duration of the different processes and sub-processes. Head CT studies conducted on 464 patients were analyzed: 245 (52.8%) males and 219 females (47.2%). Of these patients, 198 (42.7%) also performed Angio CT. In terms of process characterization, the request for the Head CT study carried out at RIS was considered the starting point. When the patient arrives at the CT room, requisition data is sent to the imaging equipment and the study is performed. At the end of the image acquisition, the study is considered completed being registered in the RIS as â€œexecutedâ€�. After the transmission of the images to the PACS database, the study is sent to the Teleradiology system. Depending on the results of the Head CT, the patient may be a candidate for Angio CT and endovascular treatment. Therefore, when an Angio CT is also required, it is performed after the realization of the Head CT. Concerning the process analysis, Table 1shows the statistical results of the time spent in Head CT studies (P1) and Angio CT procedures (P2). Surprisingly, minimum values of zero minutes were identified However, these situations occur when the process is considered complete in one information system (e.g., RIS), but has not yet completed in another information system (e.g., PACS). 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 Fig. 1.

Although the maximum time values are high, 25% of the patients that underwent a Head CT study obtained the respective report in less than 30 minutes. In the case of patients whose clinical decision determined the need for an Angio CT, this process was completed in less than ten minutes for 25% of the patients. Moreover, 25% of the patients that performed Head CT waited for the report for more than 52 minutes, and of those who performed Angio TC, 75% completed this process in less than 19 minutes (Table 1). According to Table 1, 25% of the patients wait less than seven minutes before the respective studies were performed, the images were acquired in less than four minutes and the reports were delivered in less than eight minutes. In some cases, significant standard deviations were identified, namely regarding the waiting time to enter to the CT room and the waiting time for the report, which has repercussions on the mean and median values. Regarding the decision times for performing Angio CT, for 75% of the patients, this time was less than five minutes (Table 1). However, also in Table 1 it is possible to identify significant maximum time values. For example, a patient waited five hours and 24 minutes to enter to the CT room and another patient waited three hours and 38 minutes for the report. These abnormal situations could be identified by the aggregation of data stored in the different information systems.

In turn, the Angio CT process (P2) was further divided into: â€¢ P2.1 - Angio CT decision time: time interval that elapses between the execution of Head CT and the request of an Angio CT, which might be obtained by the field [Angio CT Study Requisition Time] and the field [Routine Study Execution Time] of the RIS. â€¢ P2.2 - Angio CT procedure: time interval that elapses between the start of image acquisition from Angio CT and the completion the post-processing of the images, which might be obtained by the field [Angio CT Post Processing Time] and the field [Angio CT Study Acquisition Time] of the PACS. 4.2. Characterization of the Processes One of the aspects to be highlighted is the fact that within of the acute stroke diagnosis and treatment several information systems are used (i.e., HIS, EHR, RIS and PACS and the Teleradiology system). This distributed nature of information systems makes it difficult to identify situations of delay in the different SGW processes. In turn, data fields belonging to RIS, PACS and Teleradiology systems can be used to characterize the process and sub-processes associated to medical imaging workflow, namely in the context of suspected stroke in the acute phase. Head CT studies carried out over a year on patients with suspected stroke, integrated into the hospital SGW, were analyzed in the period from August 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018, aiming to identify the duration of the different processes and sub-processes. Head CT studies conducted on 464 patients were analyzed: 245 (52.8%) males and 219 females (47.2%). Of these patients, 198 (42.7%) also performed Angio CT. In terms of process characterization, the request for the Head CT study carried out at RIS was considered the starting point. When the patient arrives at the CT room, requisition data is sent to the imaging equipment and the study is performed. At the end of the image acquisition, the study is considered completed being registered in the RIS as â€œexecutedâ€�. After the transmission of the images to the PACS database, the study is sent to the Teleradiology system. Depending on the results of the Head CT, the patient may be a candidate for Angio CT and endovascular treatment. Therefore, when an Angio CT is also required, it is performed after the realization of the Head CT. Concerning the process analysis, Table 1shows the statistical results of the time spent in Head CT studies (P1) and Angio CT procedures (P2). Surprisingly, minimum values of zero minutes were identified However, these situations occur when the process is considered complete in one information system (e.g., RIS), but has not yet completed in another information system (e.g., PACS). 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 Fig. 1.

Although the maximum time values are high, 25% of the patients that underwent a Head CT study obtained the respective report in less than 30 minutes. In the case of patients whose clinical decision determined the need for an Angio CT, this process was completed in less than ten minutes for 25% of the patients. Moreover, 25% of the patients that performed Head CT waited for the report for more than 52 minutes, and of those who performed Angio TC, 75% completed this process in less than 19 minutes (Table 1). According to Table 1, 25% of the patients wait less than seven minutes before the respective studies were performed, the images were acquired in less than four minutes and the reports were delivered in less than eight minutes. In some cases, significant standard deviations were identified, namely regarding the waiting time to enter to the CT room and the waiting time for the report, which has repercussions on the mean and median values. Regarding the decision times for performing Angio CT, for 75% of the patients, this time was less than five minutes (Table 1). However, also in Table 1 it is possible to identify significant maximum time values. For example, a patient waited five hours and 24 minutes to enter to the CT room and another patient waited three hours and 38 minutes for the report. These abnormal situations could be identified by the aggregation of data stored in the different information systems. 612 LÃ­gia Fernandes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 606â€“614 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 4.3. Semi-Structured Interviews The interviewees are multidisciplinary health professionals, physicians and nurses of emergency services pre- hospital emergency technicians from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (Instituto Nacional de EmergÃªncia MÃ©dica â€“ INEM), diagnostic and therapeutic technicians, and developers of healthcare information systems. The interviewees were chosen due to their experience within the SGW, namely, in terms of the CODU, the first entity to activate SGW, and in the triage, diagnostic and treatment, including intensive medicine, neurology and medical imaging. The interview guide included an introduction to the presentation of the interviewer and the interviewee, an explanation of the study and the respective ethical and regulatory framework, as well as the reading, presentation, and clarification of informed consent that each participant had to read and sign before the interview. Regarding the questions, they sought to determine: i) the opinions of the interviewees regarding the organization of the SGW and the role of information systems in its different processes; ii) the key aspects to be improved in terms of organization, management and resources, namely in terms of information systems, as well as the barriers that may condition these changes; iii) how the different interviewees are using solutions based on information technologies to optimize their performance, as well as the difficulties they face; iv) how aspects related to information management, interoperability, internal and external communication, quality, certification, or ethical and transparency are being addressed; and v) suggestions regarding additional features that could be implemented to improve the information systems that support the SGW. The interviews were organized to have an estimated duration of approximately 60 minutes and to be carried out in a place with conditions to allow the audio recording, which was authorized by each of the interviewees, with signing the informed consent. Considering the statements and opinions of the interviewees, in general the procedures have already been improved in recent years and â€œthere has been an effort made by the institutions, both INEM and hospitals to improve the SGW processesâ€�. Moreover, the interviewees revealed that they themselves optimize the procedures to the extent that they could do. Regardless of their areas of expertise, all the interviewees agreed that information systems are an essential asset for operation and coordination of the SGW. One of the interviewees mentioned that â€œthere are flaws that could be easily solved with technological solutions and a better information managementâ€�, while another said that â€œthe institutions realized that it is necessary to improve the information management and systematically articulate the procedures between professionals from different specialties in line with the main objective of SGW (i.e., help, identify and treat the patient with an acute stroke)â€�. Particularly, in the pre-hospital emergency, the articulation with the referred hospital could be optimized, since â€œthe activation of stroke code continues to be done by telephone, which means that a computerized and automatic activation system could be implementedâ€�. Also, in the hospital emergency, new technological solutions could be introduced â€œin the emergency, a sticker is affixed to the patients waiting for Head CT to distinguish them as the highest priority patients, because in the list of Head CT orders, the radiographer does not know if within the higher priority patients, there are patients with the stroke code activated, and the sticker is used to identify, manually, these patientsâ€�. In the opinion of one interviewee â€œautomating this process could put the SGW patients in the top of the radiographer prioritiesâ€�. On the other hand, \"the monitoring of the patient who suffered a stroke does not end with the hospital discharge, and after that, it is important to introduce applications to support both the stroke patients and their informal caregivers\". To consolidate what was achieved in the acute phase treatment during the patient recovery, the extension of the features of the hospital information systems, namely in terms of interoperability, were considered key aspects. During the interviews, it was noticeable that some interviewees revealed a self-taught way of circumventing and optimizing the points they identified as â€œovercomeâ€�, that is, they identified points that could make a difference in their performance. For example, \"there are small, simple things that could be done, however, I am not waiting for an institutionalized solution, and I simply adopt self-agility and optimization measures that I can implement\". It should be noted that some interviewees have already looking for specific information-based applications: â€œat the level of information systems, I use them for the benefit of my professional performance and to optimize the management and 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 treatment of the patient. I have identified several mobile applications that I use to measure the duration of the different processes, namely from the street to the Head CT medical imaging studyâ€�. 5. Discussion and Conclusion Within the scope of the research study reported by this paper, the processes mapping of the requisition and the realization of medical imaging studies of acute stroke victims enabled a better understanding of the paths taken by the patients in the hospital, particularly in the medical imaging department and regarding the SGW initiative. In the case of the Head CT characterization, it was possible to identify procedures that can promote delays, which might negatively impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected acute stroke. From the moment of the request of a Head CT study until the patient enters the CT room, there is significant variability in the time spent (SD - 28 min), and 25% of the patients wait more than 20 minutes before the beginning of the study. In particular, the identification of a patient that wait five hours and 24 minutes entering the room may deserve special attention. The same reasoning can be used for the analysis of the other sub-processes. Regarding the studiesâ€™ execution time, the values obtained show that, in general, the processes are efficient, both in the Head CT study (average of five minutes) and in the Angio CT studies (average of ten minutes). However, for some patients, it was identified delays much longer than the average. The time associated with some sub-processes carried out within the scope of the SGW initiative, namely before the patient's arrival at the medical imaging department (e.g., patient transportation and laboratory data acquisition) contributes significantly to higher waiting time to diagnosis. The fact that the processes are all dependent on each other, a punctual poor performance in a specific sub-process can compromise the whole process, since it is the sum of the time spent in all processes that give the relevant data to determine how long it takes to conclude a diagnosis. The data collected allowed the identification of situations that may negatively impact the timely treatment of patients with acute stroke. In this respect it was anticipated the relevance of automatic and real-time alert systems to facilitate the adoption of best practices, as well to identify of situations that may promote the deterioration of the health conditions of the patients as well as compromising their prognosis in multiple clinical contexts, namely beyond stroke. The study allowed to conclude that the data available in the different systems supporting the medical imaging services might be used by alert systems. Moreover, the interviews that were conducted involving a group of health care professionals with experience in pre- and intra-hospital emergency services show that the professionals that work daily in the diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke are very receptive to the improvements of the existing hospital information systems.

In turn, the crowding of emergency services contributes for considerable high delay times. The research study reported by this paper aimed to identify features to include in the emergency services information systems to improve the contribution of the medical imaging within acute stroke diagnosis and treatment. Medical imaging processes related to Head Computed Tomography and Angio Computed Tomography in a medium-size Portuguese were analyzed to identify possible improvements. Moreover, semi-structured interviews were conducted involving a group of health care professionals with experience in pre- and intra-hospital emergency services to identify the needs that can be satisfied with innovative technological solutions and to assess the viability to introduce additional features in the information systems supporting the emergency services. The results show that additional features might be considered to improve acute stroke diagnosis and treatment and the health care professionals are receptive to these improvements.

Introduction In today's societies, the primary goals of healthcare provision are not possible to achieve without the use of information technologies to accurately collect, store, and process relevant healthcare information [1], whose quality can be guaranteed using diverse methods and tools [2]. In the field of medical imaging, both the clinical processes and technology used in daily practice have significantly changed during the last years, not only due to the improvement of the professional practice [3], but also due to the incorporation of new processes, namely by using huge amounts of data to recognize patterns that can be applied to medical images [4] or using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of disease, diagnoses, prognoses and appropriate treatments [5][6]. The European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) consider that secondary use of information resulting from medical imaging procedures can represent an excellent opportunity for professionals to improve their practices, which may be translated into improved healthcare to the patients [7]. In a hospital context, the information produced in the radiology service is stored in Radiological Information Systems (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). These systems are designed to support administrative and clinical processes, allowing the management of medical imaging studies and all the information associated with them (e.g., involved actors, procedures, or exposure to ionizing radiation). Medical imaging studies and related metadata are stored in PACS using the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format [8]. Within the scope of medical imaging, there are numerous aspects that should be considered when seeking to ensure that procedures are carried out according to best practices, namely in terms of radiation protection. One way to do this is using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The use of KPI in medical imaging is not new, since they are being used to define and assess the organization's success, either in clinical or financial terms. KPI differ according to the nature and strategy of the organization and may relate to i) core functions of operations management, ii) financial management, iii) patient safety and quality of care, iv) management of external stakeholders, and v) management of internal stakeholders [9]. The ESR and the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS) have published a joint paper on Patient Safety in Medical Imaging [10], which mentions some critical categories related to the radiological protection of patients and medical imaging professionals, namely within the scope of the definition and use of KPI for radiation protection management, for the evaluation of study requests, procedures, and reports that may characterize the exposure to ionizing radiation to which patients and healthcare professionals may be subject during medical imaging studies [10]. The research study presented by this paper aimed to evaluate the contribution of the DICOM metadata, publicly available and belonging to medical imaging studies stored in a healthcare institution PACS, to support some KPI suggested by the ESR and EFRS in the scope of radiological protection. The paper is organized as follows. In section two are addressed some issues related with the importance of the KPI in medical imaging context and the DICOM metadata for the development these KPI. In section three is presented the methods used for DICOM metadata analysis. The section four presents the results of the study and the respective discussion. Finally, the last section is reserved to draw a conclusion and future work initiatives. 2. Background Strategies to ensure safety and quality of medical imaging practice can be focused on the patient, system, and processes. Independently of the methods to support these strategies (i.e., proactive, or reactive methods), the aims are the cost control and the improvement of the healthcare provision with impact in the satisfaction of patients and healthcare professionals. However, the quality improvement requires the contribution of several factors [11].

Introduction In today's societies, the primary goals of healthcare provision are not possible to achieve without the use of information technologies to accurately collect, store, and process relevant healthcare information [1], whose quality can be guaranteed using diverse methods and tools [2]. In the field of medical imaging, both the clinical processes and technology used in daily practice have significantly changed during the last years, not only due to the improvement of the professional practice [3], but also due to the incorporation of new processes, namely by using huge amounts of data to recognize patterns that can be applied to medical images [4] or using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of disease, diagnoses, prognoses and appropriate treatments [5][6]. The European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) consider that secondary use of information resulting from medical imaging procedures can represent an excellent opportunity for professionals to improve their practices, which may be translated into improved healthcare to the patients [7]. In a hospital context, the information produced in the radiology service is stored in Radiological Information Systems (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). These systems are designed to support administrative and clinical processes, allowing the management of medical imaging studies and all the information associated with them (e.g., involved actors, procedures, or exposure to ionizing radiation). Medical imaging studies and related metadata are stored in PACS using the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format [8]. Within the scope of medical imaging, there are numerous aspects that should be considered when seeking to ensure that procedures are carried out according to best practices, namely in terms of radiation protection. One way to do this is using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The use of KPI in medical imaging is not new, since they are being used to define and assess the organization's success, either in clinical or financial terms. KPI differ according to the nature and strategy of the organization and may relate to i) core functions of operations management, ii) financial management, iii) patient safety and quality of care, iv) management of external stakeholders, and v) management of internal stakeholders [9]. The ESR and the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS) have published a joint paper on Patient Safety in Medical Imaging [10], which mentions some critical categories related to the radiological protection of patients and medical imaging professionals, namely within the scope of the definition and use of KPI for radiation protection management, for the evaluation of study requests, procedures, and reports that may characterize the exposure to ionizing radiation to which patients and healthcare professionals may be subject during medical imaging studies [10]. The research study presented by this paper aimed to evaluate the contribution of the DICOM metadata, publicly available and belonging to medical imaging studies stored in a healthcare institution PACS, to support some KPI suggested by the ESR and EFRS in the scope of radiological protection. The paper is organized as follows. In section two are addressed some issues related with the importance of the KPI in medical imaging context and the DICOM metadata for the development these KPI. In section three is presented the methods used for DICOM metadata analysis. The section four presents the results of the study and the respective discussion. Finally, the last section is reserved to draw a conclusion and future work initiatives. 2. Background Strategies to ensure safety and quality of medical imaging practice can be focused on the patient, system, and processes. Independently of the methods to support these strategies (i.e., proactive, or reactive methods), the aims are the cost control and the improvement of the healthcare provision with impact in the satisfaction of patients and healthcare professionals. However, the quality improvement requires the contribution of several factors [11]. 592 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 590â€“597 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 The success of any program focused in the quality of medical imaging depends on: i) the quality of the data produced; ii) the installed capacity to access these data; iii) the data analyses to assess relevant clinical processes; and iv) the ability to build KPI and respective metrics according to the policies of the medical imaging departments, which allows the preparation of adequate performance reports [12]. In this respect, the use of KPI is fundamental, since it is not possible to manage and improve what it is not possible to measure [13]. The need for quality auditing processes are recognized by National Radiological Societies in Europe; however, it is also unanimously recognized that an essential factor to take into account is the existence of technological and administrative infrastructures to support quality auditing processes [14]. The provision of medical imaging care has gradually become more patient-centered, which can be translated into significant advantages, namely in the quality and safety of procedures, reducing costs, improved outcomes and increased patient satisfaction [15]. On the other hand, the technological evolution in medical imaging has a significant impact on the level of quality of healthcare provided. For instance, within the scope of risk management, the use of data produced and stored within the scope of imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation (e.g., Computed Tomography, or Digital Radiology) can be essential for continuous improvement, namely for the optimization of the doses of ionizing radiation, which promotes the protection of patients and healthcare professionals as well as their trust in the healthcare provision [16]. As part of radiological safety and quality improvement programs, a study by Dick et al. [17] reported that a significant number of quality improvement initiatives in medical imaging departments focused on the studies appropriateness (92%) and on the recording of clinical information (92%), as well as on the use of KPI (83%). The accreditation of equipment and dose monitoring represented 75% of the initiatives. The use of DICOM metadata may contribute to medical imaging quality programs. The DICOM standard defines an information model that intends to represent real-world objects logically grouped in different modules such as, for example, a medical image. Each image has its own Information Object Definition (IOD) composed by a set of attributes. In turn, each DICOM attribute is characterized by a designation and a unique identifier (tag), being the tag composed by two numbers (i.e., Group and Element) [18]. The DICOM standard also defines a set of Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) data objects for recording and storing dose details of a medical imaging study [19]. These templates are prepared to incorporate dose metrics such as Computed Tomography (CT) Dose Index (CTDI), Dose Length Product (DLP), or Dose Area Product (DAP), along with other information types, including geometric and technical factors that can be used to estimate the radiation dose received by a patient and the adequacy of the imaging protocol being used. Some CT systems stored an image containing a screen capture of a dose report listing the CTDI and DLP values for each CT series, although the DICOM metadata of these images do not include CTDI and DLP values. In turn, some CT systems provide DLP value as a private attribute within such images or/and in the Modality Performed Procedure Step (MPPS) messages. Regarding the DICOM metadata, the headers of DICOM images may contain specific attribute tags with a subset of the dose information contained in an RDSR such as, for example, the CTDIvol (0018,9345) attribute. In some healthcare facilities, the analysis of stored DICOM metadata is complex due to different implementations of medical imaging devices. Manufacturers often use their own interpretation of international standards for the data exchange and storage. However, the usage of DICOM private tags makes it practically impossible to extract pertinent metadata [19]. On the other hand, the data stored in the different information systems that support medical imaging activities (e.g., RIS and PACS) does not always reliably represent the procedures performed [20], which may be seen as an obstacle to the production and use of indicators, mainly in terms of consistency, precision, accuracy, and integrity. Although the quality of the data stored in the PACS is essential for patient exposure characterization during medical imaging studies there may be significant variability in the number of DICOM attributes made available by the different imaging modalities [21]. For example, in the context of mammographic studies, although it is possible to store values related to radiation exposure, it can sometimes be important to analyze the quality of the data stored [22]. In the medical imaging safety and protection context, one of the KPI identified as relevant for the patient exposure assessment/characterization is the analysis of the studies carried out to identify inappropriate studies request, which can be determine from the data stored in the RIS [23], or from the data stored in the PACS. Considering the PACS, the analysis can be performed based on evaluating the values of DICOM attributes, namely the KVp, mAs, and Exposure Time values, related to each patient (i.e., using the DICOM attribute PatientID) [4]. The access and use of 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 the metadata stored in the PACS can be done with different approaches, for example, they can be patient-oriented or study-oriented approaches [24]. The DICOM metadata that characterizes PACS stored studies can also help characterize the population with studies performed in different modalities [25][26] [27]. 3. Materials and Methods The DICOM attributes that are part of the imaging studies produced by the equipment (i.e., 30 different devices from various manufacturers) of a healthcare unit and stored in the respective PACS were analyzed. The confidentiality of patients and actors involved in the provision of healthcare was guaranteed. A search was performed over PACS archive to identify the studies stored for six months. DICOM attributes related to the studies and made publicly available were identified according to the IOD of the imaging modalities CT, Computed Radiography (CR), Digital Radiography (DX), X-Ray angiography (XA), Radio Fluoroscopy (RF), Mammography (MG), and that could contribute to the definition of KPI related to radiation protection under the following workflows/topics: i) Exam Request (i.e., Inappropriate Orders, Inappropriate Orders Done); ii) Procedure (i.e., Study Oversampling, Study Over Phasing, Positioning, Study Clinical Indication, Dose Reference Levels - CDRL, Study Repeated Examinations, Studies Performed without Contrast Medium when Contrast was Required, Paediatric, Pregnant Women, Data Deleted before Image Review, Unintended Conceptus Exposure, Patient Skin Doses Managed - Interventional Radiology, Patient Threshold for Deterministic Effects - Interventional Radiology); Staff â€“ Interventional Radiology; iii) Reporting (i.e., Dose Reporting); and iv) General (i.e., Over Exposure and Quality Control) The IOD of images produced by different equipment were analyzed for each topic and modality, and the contribution of the DICOM attributes for KPI implementation was evaluated. 4. Results and Discussion The IOD of the images of six modalities were identified and analyzed (Figure 1): i) CT modality with seven devices from three manufacturers; ii) CR modality with eleven devices from three manufacturers; iii) XA modality with five devices from two manufacturers; iv) RF modality with two devices from one manufacturer; v) DX modality with three devices from three manufacturers; and vi) MG modality with two devices from two manufacturers. Table 1 presents some topics that, according to [10], are relevant to the definition of KPI in the scope of radiological protection, their definition as well as their feasibility in the scope of the analyzed imaging modalities. The Table 1 also contains the DICOM attributes that, whenever present, can be used in the definition of KPI. For each topic, and within each modality, it is indicated whether it is possible to define a KPI (+), if it is not possible (-) or if it is partially possible (Â±). In situations where it is partially possible, the DICOM attributes may partially contribute to the definition of the KPI, and the data of other information systems (e.g., RIS) should be used. Regarding the inappropriate request Figure 1 -â€“ Modalities devices and respective manufactures Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 590â€“597 593 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 The success of any program focused in the quality of medical imaging depends on: i) the quality of the data produced; ii) the installed capacity to access these data; iii) the data analyses to assess relevant clinical processes; and iv) the ability to build KPI and respective metrics according to the policies of the medical imaging departments, which allows the preparation of adequate performance reports [12].

Table 1 presents some topics that, according to [10], are relevant to the definition of KPI in the scope of radiological protection, their definition as well as their feasibility in the scope of the analyzed imaging modalities. The Table 1 also contains the DICOM attributes that, whenever present, can be used in the definition of KPI. For each topic, and within each modality, it is indicated whether it is possible to define a KPI (+), if it is not possible (-) or if it is partially possible (Â±). In situations where it is partially possible, the DICOM attributes may partially contribute to the definition of the KPI, and the data of other information systems (e.g., RIS) should be used. Regarding the inappropriate request Figure 1 -â€“ Modalities devices and respective manufactures 594 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 590â€“597 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 for imaging studies, the information available in the IOD of the analyzed images does not allow any judgment, considering the need to access information stored in information systems such as the RIS for the definition and implementation of these indicators. Regarding the topic of Study Oversampling, it is possible to define KPI based on DICOM attributes. In turn, considering the topic Study Over Phasing, it seems to be possible to analyze it based on the number of series associated with each study, namely within the scope of CT. For the other modalities, Over Exposure may, in specific contexts, be associated with the realization of a more significant number of series. In what concerns the topics CDRL and Study Performed Without Contrast Medium when Contrast was Required, these KPI can be partially defined in the analyzed modalities, having to be complemented with data from the RIS. The exception is the RF modality that does not have DICOM attributes that can significantly contribute to these indicators (apart from the patient's demographic data). On the other hand, the XA modality provides the EPSR series but with an IOD that does not provide exposure-related metadata. In the context of KPI related to patient positioning, the IODs of the analyzed modalities do not provide information regarding the positioning, except for the CT modality, which provides the PatientPosition (0018.5100) and TableHeight (0018.1130) attributes that can contribute to the evaluation of the positioning, but incompletely, requiring the analysis of the image/study by the healthcare professional. The KPI related to repeated studies can be developed in all modalities and can be supported by the attributes DICOM Modality (0008.0060), PatientID (0010.0020), StudyInstanceUID (0020,000D), StudyDate (0008.0020), StudyDescription (0008.1030) and BodyPartExamined (0018,0015) Table 1 - Radiation protectionâ€‘specific KPI listing topics and indicators for measurements and validation (partial table adapted from [10]) Workflow Topic Indicator Definitio n/Metric CR CT DX MG RF XA DICOM attributes for KPI support 1 - Order 1.1 - Inappropriat e Orders NÂº of patients and % a) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) 1.2 - Inappropriat e Orders Done NÂº of pat. and % a) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) 2 â€“ Procedure 2.1 - Study Over Sampling NÂº of pat. b) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined 2.2 - Study Over Phasing NÂº of pat. b) (-) (+) (-) (-) (-) (-) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & SeriesInstanceUID & SeriesNumber OR SeriesDescription 2.3 - Positioning NÂº of wrong positioning b) (-) (Â±) (-) (-) (-) (-) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & PatientPosition & TableHeight 2.4 â€“ Study CDRL % of pat. beyond 75% c) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (-) (Â±) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & molatily specific atributes % of pat. beyond 50% c) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (-) (Â±) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & molatily specific atributes 2.5 - Study Repeated Examinatio ns NÂº of patients with more than 5 modality studies in a year c) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined 2.6 â€“ Studies Performed without Contrast Number of patients c) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (-) (Â±) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & RequestedContrastAgent 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 Medium when Contrast was Required (+) Possible; (-) Not possible; (Â±) Partially possible. a) - If there is a CDS: data extraction If there is not an automatic data collection: retrospective review of 100 CT/mo st frequent indication (head, chest, abdomen, MSK) every year, b) - Review of 100 patients for: head, chest, abdomen, MSK every year, c) - If there is a dms: data extraction every 6 months.

Analyzing Table 2, it is possible to define KPI that allow identifying wrong paediatrics protocols, which in the MG modality case does not seem to be applicable. Regarding the topics Pregnant Women and Unintended Conceptus Exposure, metadata can partially contribute to the creation of KPI, requiring information from other information systems besides the PACS. Concerning the topic Digital Radiography Data Deleted Prior to Image Review, the DICOM metadata supports this kind of KPI if it is not allowed to delete the acquired images (i.e., DICOM metadata contribution can be considered partial).

In these modalities, DICOM metadata must be complemented with data from RDSR, Exam Protocol Structured Report (EPSR) or RIS. On the other hand, KPI related to occupational exposure do not seem to be possible. Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 590â€“597 595 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 for imaging studies, the information available in the IOD of the analyzed images does not allow any judgment, considering the need to access information stored in information systems such as the RIS for the definition and implementation of these indicators. Regarding the topic of Study Oversampling, it is possible to define KPI based on DICOM attributes. In turn, considering the topic Study Over Phasing, it seems to be possible to analyze it based on the number of series associated with each study, namely within the scope of CT. For the other modalities, Over Exposure may, in specific contexts, be associated with the realization of a more significant number of series. In what concerns the topics CDRL and Study Performed Without Contrast Medium when Contrast was Required, these KPI can be partially defined in the analyzed modalities, having to be complemented with data from the RIS. The exception is the RF modality that does not have DICOM attributes that can significantly contribute to these indicators (apart from the patient's demographic data). On the other hand, the XA modality provides the EPSR series but with an IOD that does not provide exposure-related metadata. In the context of KPI related to patient positioning, the IODs of the analyzed modalities do not provide information regarding the positioning, except for the CT modality, which provides the PatientPosition (0018.5100) and TableHeight (0018.1130) attributes that can contribute to the evaluation of the positioning, but incompletely, requiring the analysis of the image/study by the healthcare professional. The KPI related to repeated studies can be developed in all modalities and can be supported by the attributes DICOM Modality (0008.0060), PatientID (0010.0020), StudyInstanceUID (0020,000D), StudyDate (0008.0020), StudyDescription (0008.1030) and BodyPartExamined (0018,0015) Table 1 - Radiation protectionâ€‘specific KPI listing topics and indicators for measurements and validation (partial table adapted from [10]) Workflow Topic Indicator Definitio n/Metric CR CT DX MG RF XA DICOM attributes for KPI support 1 - Order 1.1 - Inappropriat e Orders NÂº of patients and % a) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) 1.2 - Inappropriat e Orders Done NÂº of pat. and % a) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) (-) 2 â€“ Procedure 2.1 - Study Over Sampling NÂº of pat. b) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined 2.2 - Study Over Phasing NÂº of pat. b) (-) (+) (-) (-) (-) (-) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & SeriesInstanceUID & SeriesNumber OR SeriesDescription 2.3 - Positioning NÂº of wrong positioning b) (-) (Â±) (-) (-) (-) (-) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & PatientPosition & TableHeight 2.4 â€“ Study CDRL % of pat. beyond 75% c) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (-) (Â±) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & molatily specific atributes % of pat. beyond 50% c) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (-) (Â±) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & molatily specific atributes 2.5 - Study Repeated Examinatio ns NÂº of patients with more than 5 modality studies in a year c) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined 2.6 â€“ Studies Performed without Contrast Number of patients c) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (Â±) (-) (Â±) Modality & PatientID & StudyInstanceUID & StudyDate & StudyDescription & BodyPartExamined & RequestedContrastAgent 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000â€“000 Medium when Contrast was Required (+) Possible; (-) Not possible; (Â±) Partially possible. a) - If there is a CDS: data extraction If there is not an automatic data collection: retrospective review of 100 CT/mo st frequent indication (head, chest, abdomen, MSK) every year, b) - Review of 100 patients for: head, chest, abdomen, MSK every year, c) - If there is a dms: data extraction every 6 months. If there is not an automatic data collection: retrospective review: 100 for head, chest, abdomen, MSK, every year. Analyzing Table 2, it is possible to define KPI that allow identifying wrong paediatrics protocols, which in the MG modality case does not seem to be applicable. Regarding the topics Pregnant Women and Unintended Conceptus Exposure, metadata can partially contribute to the creation of KPI, requiring information from other information systems besides the PACS. Concerning the topic Digital Radiography Data Deleted Prior to Image Review, the DICOM metadata supports this kind of KPI if it is not allowed to delete the acquired images (i.e., DICOM metadata contribution can be considered partial).

In these modalities, DICOM metadata must be complemented with data from RDSR, Exam Protocol Structured Report (EPSR) or RIS.

Regarding KPI that allow evaluating the registration of exposure reports, the DICOM metadata does not seem to contribute, in a significative way, to definition and implementation of these KPI (Table 3).

Conclusion The definition of KPI can contribute to continuous improvement of healthcare provision. Medical imaging studies involving patient exposure to ionizing radiation promotes the creation of pertinent data in different formats. Within the scope of radiological protection, part of important data that can support the definition of KPI are part of DICOM metadata. The results of the study presented by this paper allowed to identify the contribution of the information stored in the DICOM metadata belonging to studies carried out in a hospital context, and stored at the PACS, to the definition of some KPI recommended in the literature, namely some advocated by the ESR and the EFRS. A significant number of KPI can be supported by DICOM metadata publicly available. However, their contribution depends on the images IOD of each modality. In some cases, DICOM metadata must be complemented with other data sources, including DICOM objects (e.g., RDSR or EPSR) and information systems (e.g., RIS). As future work, it seems pertinent to define strategies that allow access and aggregation of information stored in DICOM private attributes as well as in RDSR or EPSR and other hospital information systems for the development of KPI able to reliably characterize the exposure to ionizing radiation during medical imaging studies.

One of the data sources pertinent for the development of these KPI, is the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) metadata related to medical imaging studies stored in Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS). The study reported by this paper aimed to evaluate the adequacy of DICOM metadata stored in a healthcare institution PACS to implement some KPI related to radiological protection suggested by the European Society of Radiology and the European Federation of Radiographer Societies. Data produced by 30 medical imaging devices from different manufactures related to six medical modalities (i.e., Computed Tomography, Computed Radiography, Digital Radiography, X-Ray angiography, Radio Fluoroscopy and Mammography) were analyzed. Although, a significant number of KPI can be supported by DICOM metadata, the respective compliance depends on each modality image IOD. As future work, strategies must be defined to allow access and aggregation of public and private DICOM attributes as well as attributes of the Radiation Dose Structured Report and other hospital information systems for the development of KPI to reliably characterize the exposure to ionizing radiation during medical imaging studies.

Since heuristic evaluation is a widespread method for usability assessment, the objective of the study reported by the present paper was to verify the applicability of this method to assess the usability of smart homes applications. Therefore, an experience was conducted to apply the heuristic evaluation method to assess the usability of three different smart homes applications. This evaluation involved three evaluators and was based on the Heuristic Evaluation System Checklist (HESC). The results reveal that the application of the heuristic evaluation method using the HESC is a demanding and time consuming task, since 292 sub-heuristic should be considered. In turn, the results also show that heuristic evaluation is effective in the exhaustive identification of the concrete flaws of the interfaces of smart homes applications and generates a large quantity of objective information valuable for the improvement of the applications.",

Results A total of 14953 articles were retrieved from the initial search on Web of Science, Scopus and IEEE Xplore. The initial step of the screening phase yielded 14797 articles by removing the duplicates (144 articles) or the articles without abstracts (12 articles). Based on abstracts, 4776 articles were removed since they were not published in English, or they are overviews or reviews, editorials, prefaces, and announcements of special issues, workshops or books. Moreover, 9876 articles were removed because they do not target the mobility of impaired people using smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. Finally, the full texts of the remaining 145 articles were screened and 136 articles were excluded because they do not meet the inclusion criteria. Therefore, nine articles were considered eligible for this systematic review. From those nine articles, four were published in in scientific journals [2,6-8] and five in conference proceedings [9-13]. All the included articles intend to contribute for the development of information services to support the mobility of impaired people using smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. Three of them [2,11,12] propose information services to help the collecting of accessibility data, four [6-8,13] present information services to support the navigation of impaired people, one [9] propose a smart parking information services for impaired people, and one [10] present a smart semaphore. The aims of the nine included articles are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Aims of the retrieved studies. Articles Aim Year [9] To propose an information service for the management of parking spaces allocated for use by impaired people. 2013 [10] To propose a smart semaphore able to communicate with mobile devices carried by visually impaired people to conduct them in crossing the crosswalk safely. 2016 [11] To propose a crowdsourcing information service allowing reviewing and sharing opinions regarding public and private places and architectonic barriers of a city area. 2016 [2] To propose an information service for generating knowledge about accessibility issues in urban environments. 2016 [12] To propose an information service to record accessibility information in commercial buildings. 2017 [6] To propose an information service to manage wayfinding applications that focuses on impaired people in outdoor and indoor environments. 2017 [7] To propose an information service aiming to provide personalized paths, computed based on preferences and needs of impaired people. 2017 [13] To propose a wearable mobility aid aimed at detecting in real-time obstacles in front of visually impaired people. 2017 [8] To propose an electronic long cane inspired by haptic technology to produce warning signals (e.g., vibrations and sounds) aiming to help visually impaired people whenever obstacles are detected. 2018 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3.1. Application Domains 3.1.1. Collecting Urban Accessibility Data Focusing on the European Union, Eurostat declared that there are almost five million people using wheelchairs [11]. Therefore, impaired mobility is an important issue when planning urban mobility. Nowadays, sensors embedded in smart city infrastructures allow new data collection perspectives, which means that accessibility data can be available for the management of urban spaces. Moreover, the smart citiesâ€™ paradigm also facilitates the establishment of communication channels between the citizens and the governments of the cities, which can also be used to improve urban accessibility. Therefore, three studies [2,11,12] propose applications to allow citizens in general, and especially impaired people, to provide information about public and private places of the city with respect their accessibility. Article [11] presents a crowdsourcing information service that allows the final user to upload images or comments (e.g., architectonical barriers that could represent an obstacle to cross) and also to get alternative pedestrian routes avoiding as many barriers as possible, based on the information related to the all places that have been reviewed considering their accessibility level. In terms of validation, the authors report an experiment to verify the consumption of the hardware resources (e.g., average CPU and memory consumption). In turn, article [2] also presents an information service aiming to promote the involvement of social players and citizens in the identification of urban accessibility issues. The service allows the collecting of data to be processed to produce value-added information about accessibility in the city. This information is intended to be used by the citizens to facilitate their mobility and by city managers to identify and solve accessibility issues. As a result of the proposal, a prototype was developed to show that is possible to monitor the urban accessibility in real-time and to make undertaken actions for its improvement visible to the citizens. Finally, article [12] also aims to involve the citizens in the identification of accessibility issues in public spaces. However, the focus is public commercial buildings. To record and analyze the accessibility of commercial buildings a taxonomy was created, and an information service was developed and tested in commercial buildings of Terrassa, Spain. Results demonstrate that the application can help city managers to identify accessibility issues by obtaining consistent data. 3.1.2. Accessible Navigation Navigation tasks through an environment constitute an essential activity in our daily lives [6]. However, for impaired people, these tasks might represent tremendous difficulties. For instance, an individual with a visual impairment have problems in navigating autonomously in unknown environments without personal assistance, or an individual with a motor impairment usually need information to avoid barriers. In this respect, four of the included articles of this systematic review [6-8,13], aim to develop information services to support the navigation of impaired people. Article [6] presents an accessible solution for the creation of user-focused navigation applications to help impaired people in outdoor and indoor environments in smart cities. It also allows management of multimedia content (e.g., audio and videos of the guides), based on accessibility criteria. Moreover, the routes are tailored to avoid accessibility problems. In terms of validation, the authors evaluated the accessibility of the service content, as well as performed experimental evaluations with users in different scenarios. The participating group was comprised of 11 males and nine females, aged from 20 to 75 that were divided into different categories: eight individuals without a disability, seven visually impaired individuals, three deaf individuals and two individuals using a wheelchair. Based on observation of the participants and in the application of questionnaires, the authors concluded that the proposed information service facilitates the process of management and monitoring of wayfinding services by people with and without a disability in outdoor and indoor environments [6]. The information service presented in [7] provides visually impaired people (i.e., people with low vision or with colorblindness) with personalized paths, computed based on their own preferences and needs. The system collects data from crowd sourcing and crowd sensing to map urban and architectural accessibility with different levels of trustworthiness by combining the accuracy of sensors, the credibility of the sources, and the reports coming from authoritative data sources. The authors present their trustworthiness model and discuss its efficiency using simulations.

The system collects data from crowd sourcing and crowd sensing to map urban and architectural accessibility with different levels of trustworthiness by combining the accuracy of sensors, the credibility of the sources, and the reports coming from authoritative data sources. The authors present their trustworthiness model and discuss its efficiency using simulations. 186 Nelson Pacheco Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 182â€“188 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 The information service proposed by [8], based on an electronic cane to detect obstacles and locations, use tactile and auditory warnings to help visually impaired people. The solution is supported by the sensing of urban spaces by wireless ultrasonic sensors. When an obstacle is detected above the waistline, vibrations and sounds produced inside the gripper warns the user. The system prototype was first tested by three visually impaired individuals in real environments. Then, with a new prototype, a second pilot involving 20 visually impaired individuals was conducted [8]. According the participants, early notifications of obstaclesâ€™ proximity was effective, preparing the user better to avoid a collision. In addition, the experimental results obtained from the precision and repeatability tests, were adequate [8]. Finally, article [13] presents a wearable mobility aid aimed at detecting in real-time obstacles in front of visually impaired people. The approach relies on a custom video camera, with on-board processing, worn as traditional eyeglasses and effective point-cloud processing implemented on a compact and lightweight embedded computer. This latter device also provides feedback by means of a haptic interface as well as audio messages. In the article, the authors addressed crosswalk recognition that is considered a crucial requirement in the design of an effective mobility aid. Specifically, the authors propose and evaluate a method to detect and categorize crosswalks by leveraging on point- cloud processing and deep-learning techniques. Based on the experimental results, the authors concluded that the proposed approach is effective even when dealing with large occlusions typically found in urban environments [13]. 3.1.3. Parking Impaired people face many issues when it comes to parking in urban areas which include the limited availability of spaces allocated for their use and the unauthorized usage of such spaces. Article [9] presents an information service designed and developed based on the principles brought forward by internet of things and smart cities initiatives. It integrates sensors and smart phones along with wireless and mobile communications to provide for better utilization and management of parking spaces allocated for use by impaired people. The service presents the real-time availability of parking slots in an area of interest, both for impaired people (i.e., for parking assistance) and city authorities (i.e., for usage monitoring for law enforcement and planning purposes). The authors implemented a proof of concept prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of their approach. 3.1.4. Smart Semaphore Most studies related to the mobility of visually impair aim to equip the visually impaired people with devices and sensors with the ability to capture environmental structure [10]. In turn, article [10] explores how the environment can transmit data about itself to safely-help guide visually impaired. For that, the authors [10] propose to use a smart semaphore system (i.e., traffic lights) to communicate with a mobile system carried by visually impaired people and by the coherent processing of the signals sent and received between the mobile device and the smart semaphore, to conduct the visually impaired people in the streets crossing the crosswalk safely [10]. The smart semaphore has video cameras to provide image data to the computer vision system and provides a GPS signal to guide visually impaired people when crossing the road [10]. Therefore, the route used by pedestrians to cross the road on a crosswalk is constantly monitored by the video cameras. If a visually impaired individual does any deviation from a permitted route on crosswalk, the semaphore emits a warning signal to the mobile device that is transformed in a voice alert. While the visually impaired individual does not complete to cross the road, the semaphore does not change its state (remaining closed to vehicle flux). The drivers and other pedestrians are warned that a visually impaired individual is crossing the road (by the semaphore panel). The authors stated that a prototype of the smart semaphore was assembled, but the respective assessment was not reported. 3.2. Data Sources The included articles reported the integration data from different types of sensors, as can be seen in Table 2. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 Moreover, one article [12] reports manual data entry, two article [6,7] report the use of data from the city (i.e., routes [6] or geo-referenced accessibility data about urban elements such as parks or shopping centers [6,7]), and two articles [7,11] report the use of crowd sensing data. Analyzing Table 2 is possible to conclude that the types of data being collected and processed are very specific and represent just a small part of all types of data available in a smart city. Therefore, it should be questioned if the applications reported by the included articles could be deployed without smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. Indeed, none of the articles were convincing in explaining the alignment of the applications being reported and the smart city paradigm. In general, the key word â€˜smart cityâ€™ appears in the abstract or introduction. Table 2. Data sources. Sensorâ€™s types Articles Imaging sensors [2,10,13] Depth sensors [2,13] Sensors integrated in smartphones [6,7,9] Magnetic sensors to detect the presence of vehicles [9] GPS [2,7,8,10] Ultrasonic sensors [8] Non specified sensors [11] 3.3. Maturity of the Applications Three articles [2,9,10] do not present validation results. Considering the remainder articles [6-8,11,12], article [11] presents the performance evaluation of the technological solution, article [7] presents simulation results, article [13] presents the validation of an algorithm, article [12] presents a validation in commercial buildings, and articles [6,8] report the conduction of trials involving real users. Article [6] reports a trial involving 20 participants. Eight of the participants were individuals without disability, seven were visually impaired individuals, and two were individuals using wheelchairs. In turn, article [8] reported two trials. The first involving three visually impaired individuals and the second, with an improved prototype involving twenty impaired visually impaired individuals. 4. Discussion and Conclusion Considering the current trends of research related to information services using smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures to support the mobility of impaired people (i.e., the first research question), the two most relevant applications areas are accessible navigation with four of the retrieved articles [6-8,13] and the collecting of data related to the urban accessibility with three articles [2,11,12]. Moreover, one article [9] propose a smart parking information services for impaired people, and another [10] present a smart semaphore. These studies represent an effort to take advantage of the smart cities paradigm to make cities more accessible and to facilitate the mobility of impaired people. Furthermore, this effort is increasing over the years: the oldest article that was included was published in 2013 and the remainder of the included articles were published in the three last years of this systematic review. However, the total number of included articles is not very representative within the total of articles related to smart cities. Moreover, five of the nine included articles were published in conference proceedings. Therefore, the implementation of smart cities is still not largely imbued within the spirit to facilitate the mobility of impaired people. In terms of the second research question (i.e. the data sources), several articles report the use of sensors: imaging sensors [2,10,13], depth sensors [12,13], sensors integrated in smartphones [6,7,9], magnetic sensors to detect vehicles Nelson Pacheco Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 182â€“188 187 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 The information service proposed by [8], based on an electronic cane to detect obstacles and locations, use tactile and auditory warnings to help visually impaired people.

Data Sources The included articles reported the integration data from different types of sensors, as can be seen in Table 2. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 Moreover, one article [12] reports manual data entry, two article [6,7] report the use of data from the city (i.e., routes [6] or geo-referenced accessibility data about urban elements such as parks or shopping centers [6,7]), and two articles [7,11] report the use of crowd sensing data. Analyzing Table 2 is possible to conclude that the types of data being collected and processed are very specific and represent just a small part of all types of data available in a smart city. Therefore, it should be questioned if the applications reported by the included articles could be deployed without smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. Indeed, none of the articles were convincing in explaining the alignment of the applications being reported and the smart city paradigm. In general, the key word â€˜smart cityâ€™ appears in the abstract or introduction. Table 2. Data sources. Sensorâ€™s types Articles Imaging sensors [2,10,13] Depth sensors [2,13] Sensors integrated in smartphones [6,7,9] Magnetic sensors to detect the presence of vehicles [9] GPS [2,7,8,10] Ultrasonic sensors [8] Non specified sensors [11] 3.3. Maturity of the Applications Three articles [2,9,10] do not present validation results. Considering the remainder articles [6-8,11,12], article [11] presents the performance evaluation of the technological solution, article [7] presents simulation results, article [13] presents the validation of an algorithm, article [12] presents a validation in commercial buildings, and articles [6,8] report the conduction of trials involving real users. Article [6] reports a trial involving 20 participants. Eight of the participants were individuals without disability, seven were visually impaired individuals, and two were individuals using wheelchairs. In turn, article [8] reported two trials. The first involving three visually impaired individuals and the second, with an improved prototype involving twenty impaired visually impaired individuals. 4. Discussion and Conclusion Considering the current trends of research related to information services using smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures to support the mobility of impaired people (i.e., the first research question), the two most relevant applications areas are accessible navigation with four of the retrieved articles [6-8,13] and the collecting of data related to the urban accessibility with three articles [2,11,12]. Moreover, one article [9] propose a smart parking information services for impaired people, and another [10] present a smart semaphore. These studies represent an effort to take advantage of the smart cities paradigm to make cities more accessible and to facilitate the mobility of impaired people. Furthermore, this effort is increasing over the years: the oldest article that was included was published in 2013 and the remainder of the included articles were published in the three last years of this systematic review. However, the total number of included articles is not very representative within the total of articles related to smart cities. Moreover, five of the nine included articles were published in conference proceedings. Therefore, the implementation of smart cities is still not largely imbued within the spirit to facilitate the mobility of impaired people. In terms of the second research question (i.e. the data sources), several articles report the use of sensors: imaging sensors [2,10,13], depth sensors [12,13], sensors integrated in smartphones [6,7,9], magnetic sensors to detect vehicles 188 Nelson Pacheco Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 182â€“188 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 [9], ultrasonic sensors [8] and GPS [2,7,8,10]. Moreover, [7,11] report the use of crowd sensing data and [6,7] report the use of data from the city. Regarding the proposed solutions maturity level (i.e., the third research question), it should be mentioned that two articles report the implementation of trials involving real users [6,8]. Even so, the design of the studies and the measured outcomes were poorly described, and the number of participants was small. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that when considering smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures, the articles reporting the development of information services to support the mobility of impaired people, give limited attention to value creation. This limitation were already identified in other systematic reviews related to smart city applications [4,5,14,15]. Although the authors tried, in methodological terms, to guarantee that the review selection and the data extraction of this systematic review were rigorous, it should be acknowledged that this study has limitations, namely, the dependency on the keywords and the selected databases, or the fact that both grey literature and publications written in other languages than English were excluded. Nevertheless, after this systematic review is possible to state that, in the case of information services to support mobility impaired people in the smart city context, the researchers should focus in the development of added value solutions.

A systematic review was performed based on a search of the literature. A total of nine articles were identified by this systematic review. These articles aimed to help the collecting of accessibility data, to support the navigation of impaired people, to propose smart parking for impaired people and to present a smart semaphore. The number of identified articles is not very representative within the total of articles related to smart cities and the described applications present a low maturity level and lack of assessment results, since only two articles report trials involving real users.

Introduction Nowadays, as a consequence of the demographic ageing phenomenon, the cultural and societal changes, the high and accelerated dissemination of the use of smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and sensors, and the expanded use of healthcare information, software technologies (e.g., eHealth applications [1]) assume a vital importance on the quality of healthcare delivery with impact on the expectancy and quality of life of the citizens. Healthcare is commonly seen as an expense by funders and patients but in a macroeconomics view healthcare is a market where players can add value to the economy (i.e., industries like pharmaceuticals and medical devices may represent an important contribution for Gross Domestic Product - GDP). Differentially to other industries and markets, the future of software for healthcare is quite predictable and it is possible to introduce long-term strategies. The world economy is being influenced by the globalization process, which is not new in the world history and keep being a common vector in the civilizational development from the beginning of humanity. As more global is the world, more we need to be prepared to face opportunities that can be taken. Practically all the important economic activities cannot be hermetically closed in a country market, especially when it is small such as the Portuguese is. The scale is an essential requirement to be competitive when operating internationally and that means to look for exportation as a fundamental focus for the economy sustainability. In order to define a successful strategy to develop healthcare software industry in Portugal, it is important to evaluate how is the future being prepared by this sector to access the eHealth global market. This was the objective of the study reported by this paper. In addition to this introductory section, this paper comprises four more sections: eHealth, to present a general overview of some of the current innovation trends, which represents new markets opportunities for the software industry; Methods, to describe the methodological approach of the study reported by this paper; Results, where the results of the study are presented; and Discussion and Conclusion, to discuss the results and to draw some conclusions. 2. eHealth During the last years there was a global trend trying to stop the growing rate of the healthcare costs through cost control strategies. Healthcare economists and funders have been focused on cost control and one of the concerning areas is innovation, normally seen as a cost inductor. However, citizens are asking for more healthcare and social care services [2] which means the selection of the type of innovation to adopt is fundamental. There is evidence that the choice of highly cost-effective innovations and highly effective treatments (e.g., stents for some but not for all) gain greater health conditions improvements in the adopted countries comparing to other that adopts treatments with uncertain clinical value, such as intensive care units among chronically ill patients that brings in fact the most rapid cost growth [3]. The eHealth paradigm is related to the use of technological solutions in the healthcare provision and emerge as able to provide potentially cost-effective innovations to meet the needs of citizens and to promote the services reorganization [1]. Target users of eHealth applications might be caregivers (e.g., physicians, nurses, healthcare providers, and who are taking care somehow of the patients), patients (e.g., chronic), and elderly [4]. In turn, considering the patients view, the eHealth applications can be analyzed according to application domains, namely healthy lifestyles, home safety, including applications to help to surpass loneliness and social isolation, and care of chronic conditions. When dealing with healthy lifestyles, different technological solutions (e.g., social media) are being used for citizensâ€™ education, covering a diverse population in terms of age, sex, education level, health status and healthcare intervention or disease state [5,6]. These concerns are consistent with the most common inappropriate behaviors affecting the industrialized countriesâ€™ populations [7], namely physical inactivity and obesity. Therefore, physical activity [5,8], nutrition and weight management [9] are aspects of lifestyle changing that are being considered to reduce rates of hospital admission and risk of mortality. Luis Pereira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 403â€“410 405 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 Several types of technologies (e.g., personal alarms or home automation systems) are being used to promote home safety and to help older adults to overcome emergencies [10]. Moreover, since the impact of social relationships on the risk of mortality is comparable with major, well-established risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption [11], eHealth applications might be used to overcome loneliness and isolation. Therefore, eHealth applications are consistently found to improve social support and social connectedness by providing several mechanisms, including connecting to the outside world (e.g., family members, especially grandchildren, friends, former colleagues or new contacts of shared interests) and, mostly important, boosts self-confidence and empowerment which trigger positive feelings of the individuals and their control over life and life satisfaction [12]. Concerning the use of eHealth applications to optimize the care of patients with chronic conditions, the literature reports several studies dealing with the promotion of the empowerment of patients and their informal caregivers [13,14] and the monitoring of patients with chronic diseases [15,16]. In this respect, several target chronic diseases are being considered, namely, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental health, and cancer. Since self-management of diabetes requires patient adherence to best practice recommendations (e.g., glycaemia control) there has been an interest in increasing compliance of self-care applications, namely care knowledge, prescribed medication adherence and behavior outcomes [17-19]. Concerning technological solutions to support patients with hypertension [20] and congestive heart failure [21], automatic patient data transmission by means of monitoring devices is being used together with synchronous and asynchronous communications to allow the assessment of symptoms and vital signs and the transmission of automatic alarms aiming to improve self-care behavior (e.g., adherence to prescribed medication, daily weighing or adherence to exercise recommendations). Remote monitoring is also being used to support patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to measure and transmit different types of information (e.g., weight, temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, spirometry parameters, symptoms, or medication usage) [22]. Concerning mental health, the literature reports several applications, namely, to support people with psychosis, depression, or dementia [23-25]. Furthermore, several applications intend to mitigate the undesirable side effects that can negatively affect the quality of life of patients with cancer by promoting their empowerment [26]. 3. Methods The Portuguese economy, as many others, is dependent on exportation to grow. The internal demand is also critical, but without gaining international scale, the competition ability will not be enough to keep the economy growing. Therefore, this research study aimed to determine how the Portuguese healthcare software industry is preparing the respective entrance in the eHealth global market. In this respect, it is important to determine some critical success factors for the future of healthcare software industry, since this can be fundamental in the strategic point of view. Consequently, based on a review of the scientific literature, the Portuguese industrial sectors with impact in terms of exportation were analyzed in order to identify key success factors. In parallel, a questionnaire was prepared to identify and characterize Portuguese healthcare software industry, evaluating the production of eHealth software and analyze the level of preparation of the Portuguese companies to reach in the coming years the opportunities of the eHealth market. After an introduction where the objectives of the survey and all the sponsors were referred, the questionnaire was composed by four parts. The first part included an extensive characterization of the companies through sales dimension, type of business, economic activity, kind of distribution, healthcare products weight, the exportation representativeness, and through a human resources picture on number, genders, literacy and managers experience abroad. The second part went through key factors to develop a strategy to target the healthcare software solutions market, while the third part was focused in evaluating the success factors to export software products according to software producers. Finally, the fourth part included products segmentation classified by target, products objectives, local to be used, interaction, orientation, and criticality. After the questionnaire being tested through a focus group it was sent to the universe of companies associated in the AssociaÃ§Ã£o Portuguesa de Software (ASSOFT). Answers were given mainly by phone. Based on the results of the questionnaire, the characteristics of the Portuguese healthcare software industry were identified. In the study reported 406 Luis Pereira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 403â€“4104 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 by this paper, the identified characteristics were then compared with common characteristics the Portuguese industrial sectors with impact in terms of exportation. 4. Results 4.1. Success Factors of the Portuguese Industry In general, the industry internationalization can be explained by the Uppsala model [27], gradually growing from internal to external market where the company can externalize its activities that started originally inside the country. However, this model does not completely explain the internationalization of Portuguese companies since in diverse industries like molds, machinery and electrical products, the Portuguese companies started to be reactive to external orders and then, through a real cooperation with customers and other market actors, could develop knowledge in different levels of technology and even culturally and organizationally, being accepted as components producers of big and very exigent multinational companies. According to several authors, the motivations of the Portuguese companies for internationalization were [28,29]: to overcome difficulties in disposing of products on the internal market due to stagnation or exiguity; to reduce costs and achieve economies of scale; to increase companiesâ€™ incomes; desire for growth; diversification of risks; to overcome threats of competitors; to use installed capacity; to respond to external stimuli, namely to provide customer support. The most important strategic approach for the development of the country after the regimen change to democracy, has been performed by Michael Porter [30] through a famous report about the Portuguese economy, during the 90â€™s, of the last century by Government request. Despite of this study and report being subject for political discussion and debate, there was a consensus about the industries that should be focused and the clustering strategy that all those industries should follow to be well succeed. Looking for the considered clusters (i.e., footwear, textile, wine, tourism, wood products and automotive) they are nowadays important pillars of the Portuguese economy [31]. The Portuguese footwear industry is considered a success case in the Portuguese economy and is dominated by Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) concentrated in a cluster located in northern Portugal [32,33]. After a long period of decline until 2009, since then exports have increased 55% and the Portuguese footwear industry has grown in all the most important international markets. By 2016, Portugal exported 81 million pairs of shoes, mainly leather made, valued by â‚¬1.9B, assuming the 10th position in the international market suppliers [32,33]. Textile, like footwear, is strongly internationalized, and this process started with the need to export and gain competitiveness in scale and due to the domestic market saturation [34,35]. This industry, being mainly constituted by a cluster of SME located in northern Portugal, has an important impact on Portuguese economy, assuming 10% of the total of national exportation in value, absorbing 20% of the employment and 9% of all business volume of manufacturing industries [35]. Since the main barriers are high competition based on prices, the SME developed mechanisms to share ideas among competitors and the partnerships started in the personal knowledge that are established with clients that engage in informal agreements [35]. For the wine industry the production process and viticulture sector efficiencies are quite important to determine its success and keeping competitiveness levels. In the last decades the international wine market is getting more exigent in terms of quality, so the competition increased in a very impressive way, especially with the new world wine countries coming on the scene [36]. Portugal is the 11th wine producer in the world and the 9th exporter in value and volume. Half of total production is exported, representing 2% of total national exportation. The globalization brought some challenges and threats, and so the efficiency come to be an important factor for surviving. Looking at the five Portuguese great regions of wine, in the period from 1989 to 2007 all of them improved their efficiency significantly [36]. In this millennium tourism is assumed as the leading economic sector in the world. For the Portuguese economy, the tourism is assumed as the leader sector and the capacity to attract investments to other sectors is high. Main aspects that makes Portugal an important tourism destination is linked to climate, social peace, diversity from coastline to rivers systems, people skills for languages, gastronomy, and other factors. The contribution of the sector to the GDP in 2007 was above 10% [37,38]. In the tourism sector, clusters have great importance in stimulating innovation capacity and competitiveness at all dimensions, regionally, nationally, and internationally [39]. Luis Pereira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 403â€“410 407 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 Considering the wood products, cork is the industry that Portugal assumed the worldwide leadership. The industry of cork in Portugal had a big anchor firm around the biggest cluster developed in the center of Portugal [40]. Cork industry exportation represents 63% of its production and are destined to more than 100 countries, 70% in Europe. The exports are mostly stoppers (wine and others) and about 26% are already constituted by differentiated products such as construction materials and decoration products [41]. The future of cork industry may be supported by its ecological contribution. The cork trees in Portugal produces 14 million of tons of carbon dioxide and maintain the survival of 37 different mammalsâ€™ animal species. A cork tree lives for 200 years [41]. The automotive industry in Portugal assumes the most important industrial role in the economy. It has a significant volume of revenue, a strong exports focus, a heavy position of investment in transformation industries and a high contribution for quality employment. The number of companies involved is about 900, generating an equivalent to 5,6% of the GDP of Portugal [42]. The sector exports about 98% of its production and represents 20% of all goods transactions for Portugal exportation. It absorbs 18% of all investment done in the country for transformation industry. The industry is increasingly employing 72,000 people with wages 30% above the national average with elevated qualification. The total employment impact is about 130,000 people [42]. Still looking for the Portuguese industrial clusters it is worthwhile to mention the moldsâ€™ industry, which is an exemplar case of success clustering [43]. The clustering of the moldsâ€™ industry started by 1946 in the center of Portugal [44]. The cluster have origins in the glass and automobile components industries, and an organic network started to model the production. A big part of the firms, instead of growing vertically integrating marketing, design and component production, decided to stay small probably because the big automobile companiesâ€™ legacy of division of labor and deep specialization. But this agglomeration on top of being performance influencer, was also important by originating the creation of start-ups companies. The main lesson from the Portuguese industrial sectors that are successful in the global market is that internationalization is a fundamental process for survival and for the economy growth and sustainability. Exports and its representativity in the companiesâ€™ activity are an essential indicator of success and a strategic factor to grow. Moreover, by concentrating knowledge, institutions, related businesses, competitors and specific customers in a region or nation, the clusters allow companies to special access, relationships, better information, location incentives and other advantages in terms of productivity and growth. Companies benefit in two ways by belonging to a cluster [43]: the basic operational effectiveness, since they will follow the same best practices in areas such as production processes, technologies and management techniques; and by the type of strategies and the ability to compete not only based on cost, but the possibility to develop different services and approaches to the international market that a cluster allows. This second aspect is coming to be more important in more developed economies, where rivalry must shift from low wages to low total cost. So, the efficiency must be upgraded to offer a differentiation on manufacturing process. In other words, clusters must shift from imitation to innovation and from low investment to high investment not only in physical assets but also on intangibles like skills and technologies [43]. 4.2. Characterization of the Portuguese Healthcare Software Industry In Portugal, most of the companies producing software are members of ASSOFT. The list of associated companies submitted to our questionnaire corresponds to 435 contacts which, according to the ASSOFT administration, represents about 90% of total programming market in terms of sales volume. By collecting 104 questionnaires, from which 97 questionnaires were completed, our sample represents 23% of the ASSOFT associatesâ€™ list of 435 companies, which means roughly 20% of the total sales market of software producers. As other industries, the software companies are mainly fixed in urban and coast side population centers. The big cities as Lisbon and Oporto concentrates almost 70% of all companies. The human resources present higher percentage of graduated and PhD employees than the country known levels, as well as the existence of foreign employees. The experience of managers abroad is not conclusive, but apparently, even considering their experience in differentiated countries did not contribute to diversify exportation. The female employeesâ€™ rates, despite there is no dynamic analysis, may probably improve since big companies like to leverage societal balance there in an increasing number of women graduating in information technologies engineering. 408 Luis Pereira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 403â€“4106 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 In terms of total value of the software market, exports represent 33%, considering mid points in both intervals of sales and exports percentages declared by companies on the questionnaire. About 63% of the companies export less than 10% of their sales volume and about 36% of the companies declared to have no exports, so, we have 64% of companies already linked to international market somehow. Although there are companies looking to markets such Oceania, North America and Asian countries, the main destinations for the exportation are Europe and Portuguese speaking African countries. As the volume of exportation is not a driver of this industry this analysis focused in the observation of percentage of companies who have commercial relations with each destination. Moreover, taking in consideration the percentages used by responders to classify their exportation level to each destination, about 50% of those companies are exporting high or small percentages to each destination. Also, following the answers to the questionnaire, there were an average of less than two destinations by company, in other words, a low variety of destinations for the exportation of the companies in this industry. When looking to the eHealth market, the respective companies are also concentrated in Lisbon and Oporto, but Oporto has more companies focused on eHealth than Lisbon. Among the companies answering the questionnaire, 64% seems to have no eHealth product to target. The rest 36% have at least one product. The companies that produces eHealth solutions have a total share of 32% of the Portuguese total market and 21% of their sales are related to eHealth. All this eHealth software production is massively dominated (83%) by large companies, which are mainly multinational companies. The part of exports that is dedicated to eHealth represents 5% of the total exportation, and less than 1% of total market sales of those companies who produce healthcare solutions, consequently with no expression on total market. Following the answers to the questionnaire, the external markets are South Europe and Portuguese speaking African countries, following the all sector trend. When compared to other industries with high percentage of sales as exportation, the conclusion is that the software industry with 16% of total sales as exports is not that focused in the global market. Also, the production of eHealth products represents only 5% of total market, so there is no specialization on this segment. About 67% of business made to customer and 33% of the business is licensed based. This ratio is different from the national 50/50 orientation. But the situation of non-patent production among the producers of eHealth software shows low sustainability for the future. This data is highly influenced by large companies that are not patenting their products at all. If we see company by company, the patent strategy is mostly common according to the general market of software. It seems that a significant number of the companies with eHealth products have developed them interacting with other software or hardware solutions. However, there is no consistent model of clustering on eHealth products. Clustering is very important to target international markets and the results show that Portuguese software industry is not succeeded on this so important goal. 5. Discussion and Conclusion Aspects like clustering to improve coopetition, differentiation, high quality, exportation destinations and other were common to all Portuguese industrial sectors that are successful in the global market. Therefore, we can take some conclusions about all these aspects for the Portuguese software industry. The research did not find any indicator that could justify a different approach for this industry when compared with others relatively to regional clustering and, according to the results, it seems that there is no consistent model of clustering on eHealth products. Since clustering is very important to target international markets, the results show that software industry is not succeeded on this so important goal. Indeed, despite the good roll of start-ups incubators around the universities in Portugal, there is no evidence of a clustering activities around the big software companies, like those observed in the cork and automotive industries in Portugal. The notion of software activities being linked through internet not requiring location aggregation for clustering is discussable even knowing the cluster experiences around the world. Nevertheless, an important player attracting start- ups satellites are common in these markets, as seen in Finland with Nokia and even in Portugal with Portugal Telecom, before its bankrupt. More investigation is required to substantialize and quantify these moves. The exportation is low and concentrated, the psychic distance seems to be short even requiring more precise investigation on the matter. Exports in the eHealth software follow the traditional destinations of the normal software market, choosing countries culturally closed to Portugal, so there is low preparation for the real globalization that this market requires. Extend the psychic distance to diversify the exportation destinations is not done only by sending Luis Pereira et al. / Procedia Computer Science 181 (2021) 403â€“410 409 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 Portuguese experts abroad to improve networking. Much probably the companies may need to really internationalize themselves, by hiring abroad. Considering the domestic market, an important customer is the public sector, more concretely the Ministry of Health, the main player in healthcare in Portugal as funder, provider and regulator of the National Health Service. However, this centralism is not facilitating the so needed clustering and competition in Portugal for the segment of software for eHealth. As a positive aspect, it is worthwhile to mention that the human resources seem to be adjusted for the coming challenges. Further research is required to understand how healthcare is dimensioned by the software industry in Portugal and if the potential clustering processes can be developed around large companies or big stakeholders as hospitals or private healthcare groups that could leverage the small intervening companies that together could develop the production and innovation of software for healthcare. To scale production to the international market, public and private operators could work together through an organization such as Health Cluster Portugal that get already experience in helping the leveraging of healthcare industries such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

A questionnaire was prepared to identify and characterize the Portuguese healthcare software industry. Relevant aspects of this sector were compared with common characteristics of the Portuguese industrial sectors that are successful in the global market. According to the results, Portuguese healthcare software industry exports for countries culturally closed to Portugal, so there is low preparation for the globalization that the eHealth market requires. Moreover, it seems that there is no consistent model of clustering on eHealth products, contrary to what is a common a characteristic of the Portuguese industrial sectors with strong impact in terms of exportation.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: Health care provided to older adults must take into account the characteristics of chronic diseases and the comorbidities resulting from ageing. However, health services are still too oriented towards acute situations. To overcome this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a set of Age-Friendly Principles that seek to optimize the provision of health care for this population. This article aims to understand how such Principles are considered in the implementation of age-friendly health care worldwide. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to synthesize the literature on age-friendly health care in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Results: The research identified 34 articles, with only seven recognizing the WHO Principles and only four using the implementation toolkit. In addition, in the context of primary care, three studies recognize the WHO Principles, but only two use the toolkit. Conclusions: The WHO Principles are being implemented in health care, but in a smaller scale than desired, which reveals possible flaws in their dissemination and standardization. Thus, a greater scientific investment in age-friendly health care should be considered, which represents a greater operationalization of the Principles and an evaluation of their effectiveness and impacts.",

        "doc_abstract": "© Carl Markert, Farzan Sasangohar, Bobak J Mortazavi, Sherecce Fields.Background: The assessment of usability is a complex process that involves several steps and procedures. It is important to standardize the evaluation and reporting of usability procedures across studies to guide researchers, facilitate comparisons across studies, and promote high-quality usability studies. The first step to standardizing is to have an overview of how usability study procedures are reported across the literature. Objective: This scoping review of reviews aims to synthesize the procedures reported for the different steps of the process of conducting a user-centered usability assessment of digital solutions relevant for older adults and to identify potential gaps in the present reporting of procedures. The secondary aim is to identify any principles or frameworks guiding this assessment in view of a standardized approach. Methods: This is a scoping review of reviews. A 5-stage scoping review methodology was used to identify and describe relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 as follows: identify the research question, identify relevant studies, select studies for review, chart data from selected literature, and summarize and report results. The research was conducted on 5 electronic databases: PubMed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Reviews that met the inclusion criteria (reporting on user-centered usability evaluation procedures for any digital solution that could be relevant for older adults and were published in English) were identified, and data were extracted for further analysis regarding study evaluators, study participants, methods and techniques, tasks, and test environment. Results: A total of 3958 articles were identified. After a detailed screening, 20 reviews matched the eligibility criteria. The characteristics of the study evaluators and participants and task procedures were only briefly and differently reported. The methods and techniques used for the assessment of usability are the topics that were most commonly and comprehensively reported in the reviews, whereas the test environment was seldom and poorly characterized. Conclusions: A lack of a detailed description of several steps of the process of assessing usability and no evidence on good practices of performing it suggests that there is a need for a consensus framework on the assessment of user-centered usability evaluation. Such a consensus would inform researchers and allow standardization of procedures, which are likely to result in improved study quality and reporting, increased sensitivity of the usability assessment, and improved comparability across studies and digital solutions. Our findings also highlight the need to investigate whether different ways of assessing usability are more sensitive than others. These findings need to be considered in light of review limitations.",

The main goal of the study reported by this paper was to identify the incidents related to the orientation process based on the connection by a rope between an athlete and the respective guide on the 100m sprint for Paralympic visually impaired athletes. This allowed to elicit the requirements of a possible solution based on information technologies to optimize orientation in running tracks. To identify the type of incidents, 186 official championship videos of T11 to T13 sports' classes of the 100m sprint races were analyzed, and all incidents were registered. The incidents were defined according to the International Paralympic Committee rules and include errors or fails, performance issues, unfinished races, and disqualifications. The results show that in almost half of the races there were incidents that affected the dynamics of the athlete-guide pair. Therefore, the results indicate difficulties in performing a synchronized and incidents free race using only one rope to guide the visually impaired athletes, and make it clear that they would benefit from a digital solution to improve their perception of what surrounds them, namely by providing information about the running tracks, routes and locations. These results could impact the Paralympic sport, namely by minimizing the interferences of the guides on the performance of the visually impaired athletes.",

A first step to standardizing is to have an overview of how experts-based usability evaluation studies are reported across the literature. Objectives: to describe and synthesize the procedures of usability evaluation by experts that are being reported to conduct inspection usability assessments of digital solutions relevant for older adults. Methods: a scoping review of reviews was performed using a five-stage methodology to identify and describe relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 as follows: i) identification of the research question; ii) identification of relevant studies; iii) select studies for review; iv) charting of data from selected literature; and v) collation, summary, and report of results. The research was conducted on five electronic databases: PubMed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were identified, and data extracted for further analysis, including evaluators, current usability inspection methods, and instruments to support usability inspection methods. Results: a total of 3958 articles were identified. After a detailed screening, 12 reviews matched the eligibility criteria. Conclusion: overall, we found a variety of unstandardized procedures and a lack of detail on some important aspects of the assessment, including a thorough description of the evaluators and of the instruments used to facilitate the inspection evaluation such as heuristics checklists. These findings suggest the need for a consensus framework on the experts' assessment of usability that informs researchers and allows standardization of procedures.",

Cognivitra aims to increase the number and duration of training sessions and to overcome restrictions imposed by the availability of human and physical health care resources, and the aim of the study reported by this article was the assessment of the respective functional prototype. Methods: an observational study was conducted to assess the functional prototype using a peer review approach. The prototype was exposed in a highly specialized event related to healthy and active ageing, and key stakeholders were invited to test it and share their insights, including expectation of use, perception of market value, suggestions for improvement and other comments. Results: the observational study was conducted with 57 specialists in information technology-based applications to support healthy and active ageing, with an average age of 41.5 years. The results indicate that most of the participants would use or suggest the utilization of Cognivitra. Moreover, the participants made positive comments and improvement suggestions that focused on the difficulty level, the system response performance, the intuitiveness of icons and instructions, the user interaction, and the exercise duration. Conclusion: in general participants considered that Cognivitra is a useful tool and may represent an added value for remote dual task training. Although the results of this study were very positive and encouraging, improvements should be implemented before starting tests with real users.",

Based on the ICF conceptual framework, the article presents the ICF based Usability Scale (ICF-US) to evaluate the usability of technologies for ageing in place and reports a study aiming: (1) to validate the ICF-US to evaluate usability according to the evaluators’ perspective about the users’ performance and (2) to evaluate the utility and applicability of the ICF-US. Two observational studies evolving 184 participants were conducted to: (1) assess the validity and reliability of the ICF-US to evaluate usability according to the evaluators’ perspective about the users’ performance and (2) to verify the utility and applicability of the ICF-US. The results suggest that the ICF-US is valid and reliable and can be used in different stages of technological developments without losing its discriminatory capacity.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the effect of PA interventions using an app compared to no intervention or traditional interventions were included. Pooled effects using the standardized mean difference (SMD) or the weighted mean difference (WMD) were calculated and the overall quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE. Eleven studies were included. In the short term, pooled estimates showed a small and positive effect in the number of steps favoring interventions using a mobile app when compared with no interventions (WMD = 1579.04, 95%CI 454.04 to 2703.38) and with traditional interventions (WMD = 665.96, 95%CI 167.92 to 1164.00). For self-efficacy and at follow-up, results favoured traditional interventions (WMD = −8.20, 95%CI −14.25 to −2.15). Non-significant results were found for the remaining comparisons. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low.

Thus, usability assessment with methodological rigor is essential to minimize errors and undesirable consequences, as well as to increase user acceptance. Objective: this study aimed to synthesize and evaluate existing studies on the assessment of the usability of pain-related apps using a newly developed scale. Methods: an electronic search was conducted in several databases, combining relevant keywords. Then titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. The eligible studies were retrieved and independently screened for inclusion by two authors. Disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached. Results: a total of 31 articles were eligible for inclusion. Quality assessment revealed that most manuscripts did not assess usability using valid instruments or triangulation of methods of usability assessment. Most manuscripts also failed to assess the three domains of usability (effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction). Conclusions: future studies should consider existing guidelines on usability assessment design, development and assessment of pain-related apps.",

Systematic literature searches were conducted in Pubmed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Academic Search Complete and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included if they reported on the validity and/or reliability of a mobile application aiming primarily at measuring physical activity in humans with or without pathology. The reference lists of included articles were also screened for reports not identified through electronic searches. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by 2 independent reviewers and data extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. A total of 25 articles were included in this review, of which 18 refer to validity and 7 to both validity and reliability. Mean percentage difference was used as an indicator of validity and varied between 0.1% and 79.3%. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients varied between 0.02 and 0.99 indicating poor to excellent reliability. There is conflicting and insufficient evidence on the validity and reliability, respectively, of apps for measuring physical activity. Nevertheless, velocity and the place where the smartphone is carried seem to have an impact on validity.",

Introduction Healthcare systems today face common challenges and unpredictable future, namely concerning the need to respond to a growing and more complex demand of care, in a context of new diseases, financial constraints and a decrease in the workforce motivation, which may raise questions about the sustainability of the current models. Hence, it may be necessary to move from a fragmented system to a more coordinated arrangement, which is the aim of integrated care [1,2]. The theme of organizational design and the issue of contingency in the best alternative choices for the design of healthcare organizations has evolved by incorporating concepts such as organizational homeostasis [3] or systems thinking [4,5] or recognizing that excellence is not the result of distinction in each function separately, but it has to consider the remaining stakeholders, including own employees, suppliers, customers, government and society in general [6]. Ureda and Yates [7], using the fundamentals of systems thinking, consider that systems must be able to guarantee anticipation, integrity, strength, and additional reserves to maintain their balance against the environment. Coordination with other systems allows them to develop the capacity to deal with future threats. Hence, the systems must look beyond stability. With regard to healthcare systems, as an alternative to systems oriented to professionals or to technologies, it is crucial to resort to a variety of mechanisms, from greater accountability of the parties, to a greater focus on the patient as a whole. In the words of Geddes and colleagues [8], the lack of an integrated strategy across policy areas serves to perpetuate and even increase the existing compartmentalization and polarization of sectoral interventions, thus decreasing the success of tackling inequalities and making healthcare systems more sustainable. This co-production of healthcare is enabled by the proliferation of new technologies and access to information [9,10], which create the framework for determining which policies can be designed, how policy objectives can be achieved and how short and medium-term deadlines can be established. In fact, problem identification and priority setting processes are based on existing healthcare system indicators. Accordingly, the existence of a set of indicators providing a comprehensive picture of the existing heath system situation enables further monitoring and evaluation of healthcare objectives and goals set up by a strategy or program [11]. The objective of the study reported by this paper was to assess the available information to support the management and evaluation of integrated care provision, by comparing the availability of a comprehensive set of indicators related to the integrated care provision with the availability of other healthcare provision indicators. In addition to this introductory section, the present article comprises four more sections: Background, to explain the current concepts related to the integration of care; Methods, to present the study design; Results, to include the results from the assessment of the availability of various healthcare provision indicators; and Discussion and Final Remarks, to discuss the results and to draw a conclusion. 2. Background According to the definition proposed by WHO, in 2008, healthcare integration is the â€œorganization and management of healthcare services so that people receive the care they need, when they need it, in a simple way, to achieve the desired results and ensure a cost-effective provisionâ€� [1,p.5]. The integration of care can be seen from different perspectives. The patients expect: coordinated services; that their time is valued; professionals who care about their health conditions as a whole and who are able to communicate with each other through the various healthcare levels (and beyond the boundaries of their institutions) relative to their cases. For providers, integration means that formally separated entities provide services jointly (or coordinated) managed, financed, and evaluated. At the macro level, both from the perspective of top management or policy makers, integration happens when decisions on policies, funding, regulation, or provision are properly connected [1,12].

Background According to the definition proposed by WHO, in 2008, healthcare integration is the â€œorganization and management of healthcare services so that people receive the care they need, when they need it, in a simple way, to achieve the desired results and ensure a cost-effective provisionâ€� [1,p.5]. The integration of care can be seen from different perspectives. The patients expect: coordinated services; that their time is valued; professionals who care about their health conditions as a whole and who are able to communicate with each other through the various healthcare levels (and beyond the boundaries of their institutions) relative to their cases. For providers, integration means that formally separated entities provide services jointly (or coordinated) managed, financed, and evaluated. At the macro level, both from the perspective of top management or policy makers, integration happens when decisions on policies, funding, regulation, or provision are properly connected [1,12]. 348 GonÃ§alo Santinha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 346â€“353 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 The underlying values of integrated care are discussed in [12] as the basis on which to develop a framework for governance, guiding behaviour, decision-making and evaluation of integrated care. In this respect, different levels and contexts are distinguished: at the macro-level, values can help integrated care initiatives in the definition of a mutual desirable goal (e.g. quality and evaluation); serve as governance principles for the alignment between organizations in integrated care initiatives and partnerships and can also be used as guiding principles for strategy development and management. At the meso-level, values could also play a role in guiding multidisciplinary care professionals in their daily collaboration with colleagues and other parties (e.g. volunteers); at the micro-level, values could serve as professional guiding principles in the delivery of healthcare services, engaging patients and their families more, in order to â€˜co-produceâ€™ healthcare provision. In essence, the goal of care integration is to ensure that patients have access to the services they need, at the appropriate time and place, in a financially sustainable manner, which appears to be particularly important when services provided by individual institutions and/or professionals do not cover the integral needs for care [13]. The concept of integrated care is also related to the concepts of case management and disease management. In case management, there is a focus on the coordination of the various elements that make up the healthcare system. It requires the evaluation of multiple needs the patient may experience in the long term and it includes recommendations for care, monitoring and tracking of the patients, even when they leave the healthcare system. The goal is to avoid hospital re- admissions and the use of emergency services by individuals with multiple pathologies that require more intensive and continuing monitoring. It is a comprehensive and systematic process of screening, assessing, planning, organizing, coordinating, and monitoring the healthcare provision. This proactive process has four main objectives: to improve coordination, adequacy and consistency between services and systems; to increase patientsâ€™ choice and flexibility in providing services; to ensure a more cost-effective service and to improve outcomes for patients (e.g., quality of life, autonomy) [14]. Disease management is usually focused on patients with a single chronic disease, which, through a continuous and coordinated process of care, aims to improve the health status of specific population groups throughout the various stages of the disease. This segmentation of the population is made to chronic patient groups with increased risk of deterioration of their health status and that represent high costs for healthcare systems [14]. Tackling chronic disease in Europe is a big challenge in the organization of healthcare systems as well as in the definition of health policies. In this sense, as the latest economic and epidemiological analysis suggest [15], the priority should be the (integrated) management of the disease. However, in the lack of a single formula, the choice on the best or optimal combination of strategies is crucial [15]. It is widely recognized that health outcomes depend not only on healthcare services and their professionals but are also strongly conditioned by the context and behaviours of each patient. Currently, the responsibility for managing care in transitions between levels and/or institutions still rests mainly on patients and their families. Hence, it is indispensable to know their needs and expectations, seeking, whenever possible, necessary, and suitable, to configure the â€œvalue propositionâ€� of care services by integrating this same knowledge. Another important aspect to be addressed will be the training of patients and families for the course of treatment, namely by providing information on how to manage their health conditions, and who to contact if needed. In this respect, four important areas are emphasized in assessing the quality of transitions: information transfer; preparation of the patient and caregivers, particularly the family; the ability to self-care management; and the patientsâ€™ ability to choose. In this respect, information transfer, medication instructions and treatment guides are particularly relevant when institutions and professionals work independently and communication between them is poor [16]. Successful management of chronic disease requires not only effective drugs, but also a greater capacity for self-management of the disease, specifically with respect to adherence to therapy [15]. It is also supported in the literature that the measures and methodologies to assess the performance of care providers that are traditionally used are consistent with a fragmented supply, which calls for the development of adequate measures for the systems systematic monitoring, crucial to support political decision [15,17]. According to [18], the potential return of the system resides on its ability to provide an integrated continuum of coordinated services. In this sense, the focus must be on the maintenance, rehabilitation, or recovery of patientsâ€™ health, which is believed to be only possible if the focus relies on the coordination and evaluation of care throughout the system [15]. Furthermore, [15] recommends that it must be ensured that the information produced by the system is available to those who have 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 the capacity and willingness to make independent evaluations, namely, to assess the cost-effectiveness of the experiences and / or interventions. A 1996 WHO report [19] had already addressed this issue and emphasized governance as crucial to ensure integration of care, proposing some guidelines for a national strategy and its action plan: the creation of a political and strategic infrastructure that reflects a real commitment of governments to the integration of healthcare; the regional assessment of health needs in order to match supply; the introduction of organizational and structural changes, which may involve a reorganization in the distribution of powers, in particular the granting of more power to the regions; the promotion of research in this area, namely to establish a monitoring system supporting the integrated provision of healthcare. Article [20] denotes that researchers appear to have been focusing their attention on the service delivery design of integrated care, with a current move toward the notion of person-centeredness as a way of modelling any aspect of processes and interaction with patients and their caregivers, a viewpoint that tends to increase the interdependencies between the different components of healthcare and social care systems. We recall in this regard the concept of Health in all Policies [21], which translates into the development of a horizontal health policy focused on identifying the factors that influence the health of populations, mostly conditioned by sectoral policies that go far beyond the healthcare sector. This approach assumes that health conditions are not only the result of the activity of the healthcare sector per se, but they are also determined by the living conditions and other socio-economic factors. Therefore, it has deep roots in public health and helps to strengthen the link between health policies and other policies in various sectors (e.g., social, agricultural, education, environment, transport, tax system). Such multisector approach adds new forms of governance, mainly by forging new strategic relationships, both within government and with non-state actors, to address the most challenging health problems. Even though the pace of change needed to address this new governance challenge is still in slow motion, namely in countries marked by a long tradition of centralized governance such as Portugal [22], such perspective is strongly underlined in most political agendas and supported by decision-makers [23]. As a result of the work of Dias and colleagues [24], a set of strategic dimensions were proposed for analysis and intervention in the integration of care, namely: governance; financing model; human resources; information management; client empowerment; structures and assessment. Governance and clinical integration emerge as critical aspects, undertaken as a means and an objective to improve system performance, which may be achieved through integrated disease management, case management and/or increased investment in self-care. On the strategic tie, there are four dimensions seen as enablers of clinical integration: financing model, human resources, client empowerment and information management. With regard to the structure for the integration of care it is reasoned that the formal integration is one possibility, but that it can also result from articulation or coordination experiments, in which processes assume a prominent position. For the performance evaluation, it is proposed to measure the outputs of healthcare integration efforts, through effectiveness and efficiency metrics. The integration of care can be assessed at the macro level (healthcare system), at the meso level (focus on healthcare organizations and the services they provide) and at a micro level (patient/career interaction). However, there is a lack of consolidated models for assessing the integration of care, with generic application in macro and meso levels, except for some specific programs or application areas. Moreover, there is a lack of large-scale studies, population-based, in the context of chronic disease [15]. Information management, innovation and use of information and communication technologies are a major priority in current health policies, with particular emphasis on the patientsâ€™ information integration. This is based on the assumption that timely access to patientsâ€™ information can help to improve medical decisions and to manage the transitions of patients when necessary more effectively. Hence, many European governments have been supporting projects in health information systems, in particular the e-health platforms and electronic health records, to improve the sharing of information between healthcare providers, patients, pharmacists and other stakeholders. These platforms can incorporate from guidelines for health professionals to relevant information for the patients [16] and, also, can provide relevant indicators for the governance of healthcare provision. GonÃ§alo Santinha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 346â€“353 349 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 The underlying values of integrated care are discussed in [12] as the basis on which to develop a framework for governance, guiding behaviour, decision-making and evaluation of integrated care. In this respect, different levels and contexts are distinguished: at the macro-level, values can help integrated care initiatives in the definition of a mutual desirable goal (e.g. quality and evaluation); serve as governance principles for the alignment between organizations in integrated care initiatives and partnerships and can also be used as guiding principles for strategy development and management. At the meso-level, values could also play a role in guiding multidisciplinary care professionals in their daily collaboration with colleagues and other parties (e.g. volunteers); at the micro-level, values could serve as professional guiding principles in the delivery of healthcare services, engaging patients and their families more, in order to â€˜co-produceâ€™ healthcare provision. In essence, the goal of care integration is to ensure that patients have access to the services they need, at the appropriate time and place, in a financially sustainable manner, which appears to be particularly important when services provided by individual institutions and/or professionals do not cover the integral needs for care [13]. The concept of integrated care is also related to the concepts of case management and disease management. In case management, there is a focus on the coordination of the various elements that make up the healthcare system. It requires the evaluation of multiple needs the patient may experience in the long term and it includes recommendations for care, monitoring and tracking of the patients, even when they leave the healthcare system. The goal is to avoid hospital re- admissions and the use of emergency services by individuals with multiple pathologies that require more intensive and continuing monitoring. It is a comprehensive and systematic process of screening, assessing, planning, organizing, coordinating, and monitoring the healthcare provision. This proactive process has four main objectives: to improve coordination, adequacy and consistency between services and systems; to increase patientsâ€™ choice and flexibility in providing services; to ensure a more cost-effective service and to improve outcomes for patients (e.g., quality of life, autonomy) [14]. Disease management is usually focused on patients with a single chronic disease, which, through a continuous and coordinated process of care, aims to improve the health status of specific population groups throughout the various stages of the disease. This segmentation of the population is made to chronic patient groups with increased risk of deterioration of their health status and that represent high costs for healthcare systems [14]. Tackling chronic disease in Europe is a big challenge in the organization of healthcare systems as well as in the definition of health policies. In this sense, as the latest economic and epidemiological analysis suggest [15], the priority should be the (integrated) management of the disease. However, in the lack of a single formula, the choice on the best or optimal combination of strategies is crucial [15]. It is widely recognized that health outcomes depend not only on healthcare services and their professionals but are also strongly conditioned by the context and behaviours of each patient. Currently, the responsibility for managing care in transitions between levels and/or institutions still rests mainly on patients and their families. Hence, it is indispensable to know their needs and expectations, seeking, whenever possible, necessary, and suitable, to configure the â€œvalue propositionâ€� of care services by integrating this same knowledge. Another important aspect to be addressed will be the training of patients and families for the course of treatment, namely by providing information on how to manage their health conditions, and who to contact if needed. In this respect, four important areas are emphasized in assessing the quality of transitions: information transfer; preparation of the patient and caregivers, particularly the family; the ability to self-care management; and the patientsâ€™ ability to choose. In this respect, information transfer, medication instructions and treatment guides are particularly relevant when institutions and professionals work independently and communication between them is poor [16]. Successful management of chronic disease requires not only effective drugs, but also a greater capacity for self-management of the disease, specifically with respect to adherence to therapy [15]. It is also supported in the literature that the measures and methodologies to assess the performance of care providers that are traditionally used are consistent with a fragmented supply, which calls for the development of adequate measures for the systems systematic monitoring, crucial to support political decision [15,17]. According to [18], the potential return of the system resides on its ability to provide an integrated continuum of coordinated services. In this sense, the focus must be on the maintenance, rehabilitation, or recovery of patientsâ€™ health, which is believed to be only possible if the focus relies on the coordination and evaluation of care throughout the system [15]. Furthermore, [15] recommends that it must be ensured that the information produced by the system is available to those who have 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 the capacity and willingness to make independent evaluations, namely, to assess the cost-effectiveness of the experiences and / or interventions.

Methods As a starting point of the study reported by this paper, it was assumed that if the information available throughout the process of care is up-to-date and reliable, this will positively influence the planning and organization of the healthcare services, particularly with regard to referral of patients, and also to ensure greater consistency of care provision. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to identify for the NUTS 3 Region of Aveiro, Portugal, the available indicators to support the management and evaluation of integrated care provision, and to compare the availability of these indicators with the availability of other healthcare provision indicators of the same region. The study design included three phases: ï‚· Definition of the indicators. ï‚· Collection of these indicators for the Region of Aveiro, since 2011 till 2018. ï‚· Comparison between the availability of indicators related to the management and evaluation of integrated care provision and the availability of general healthcare provision indicators of the Region of Aveiro. In the first phase, 153 indicators were identified across four different categories: ï‚· The first category includes sociodemographic, social and economic indicators, such as: number of inhabitants, unemployment rate, level of education, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, ageing index, mortality rate, natality rate, and life expectancy at birth. ï‚· The second category includes several indicators related to the demand for healthcare, such as: causes of death, preterm births, and number of patients enrolled in primary healthcare units. ï‚· The third category includes indicators related to integrated healthcare provision, such as the referral of patients among the different levels of the healthcare services. ï‚· The fourth category includes all the other indicators related to supply of healthcare, such as: number of primary care units, number of hospitals, numbers of continuous care, number of pharmacies, number of human resources per institution, number of appointments carried out by the institution, number of clinical procedures per type of intervention of the different institutions, the number emergencies, or number of hospitalized patients. The second phase, data collection of the indicators, was done between March 2019 and July 2019 with the purpose to gather all the available indicators between 2011 and 2018. For the sociodemographic indicators and demand for healthcare, data was collected using a major national data source for statistics - Instituto Nacional de EstatÃ­stica (National Institute of Statistics - NIS). For the supply of healthcare, including the supply of integrated healthcare, data was collected using mainly data provided from NIS, AdministraÃ§Ã£o Regional de SaÃºde Centro (Regional Health Administration of the Centre), Agrupamento de Centros de SaÃºde do Baixo Vouga (Grouping of Health Centres of Baixo Vouga, primary care), Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga (Hospital Centre of Baixo Vouga), and Portal da TransparÃªncia (Transparency Portal). Finally, the third phase of the study (i.e., comparison between the availability of integrated care provision indicators and the availability of general healthcare provision indicators) was performed in the beginning of 2020. 4. Results Among the 153 indicators identified in this study, 119 were available and 34 were not available. When considering the available indicators, it was found that all sociodemographic indicators were available from the NIS data source. However, all the indicators were only available until the end of 2017. Similarly, to the category demand for healthcare all the indicators were available at NIS data source until the end of 2017, except the number of patients with at least one medical appointment in their primary care unit, by age, sex, dwelling, education, and nationality. Analysing the indicators of the category supply of healthcare, excluding the subcategory related to healthcare provision that demands the integration of services, it was possible to conclude that the vast majority of the indicators 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 related to primary healthcare and hospitals were not available publicly, but they were provided by request. However, eleven indicators were not available. From these, five were related to deliveries (e.g., percentage of caesarean deliveries), three were related to waiting times (e.g., waiting times in the emergency room by severity level), two were related to outcomes of surgical procedures (e.g., rate of postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) and one was related to intra-hospital mortality by major diagnose. However, when considering the supply of integrated healthcare category, it was possible to conclude that those indicators are not publicly available, and neither could be provided by the involved institutions. These indicators are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Unavailable indicators from the subcategory indicators related to healthcare provision that demands the integration of services. Indicator Private healthcare providers in the Region of Aveiro. Number of human resources, by professional category and by type of continuous care units (CCU) located in the Region of Aveiro.

Number of patients admitted to CCU located in the Region of Aveiro with palliative needs. Â From the unavailable indicators, some were not available because the institutions did not collect the data routinely to construct them or the information systems were not prepared to provide the required information, which was the case of the waiting time to be referred for continues care, but some of them were not available because the institutions did not provide publicly the data needed, which was the case of schedules for primary healthcare. 5. Discussion and Final Remarks Within the scope of this work, it is possible to assert the dearth of indicators related mainly to continuous care, a crucial component of the care to be provided to chronic patients. The healthcare delivery system already put forth an agenda setting within the scope of long-term care by implementing the national network of integrated long-term care (RNCCI). Being reinforce by Decree-Law n.Âº 136/2015, this agenda gained a renewed impetus with the recent publication of Dispatch nÂº. 6479/2019, which foresees a closer collaboration between healthcare regional administrations and the Social Security Institute. Paradoxically, however, such agenda is now being followed by the necessary, comprehensive, and timely information on the continuum of care, hence preventing a proper advance planning of the patientsâ€™ case management. Such lack of information is particularly evident in indicators related to GonÃ§alo Santinha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 346â€“353 351 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 3.

Such lack of information is particularly evident in indicators related to 352 GonÃ§alo Santinha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 346â€“353 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 7 patientsâ€™ referrals and access, particularly for long-term care. This result confirms what is sustained in literature, that highlights the systems fragmentation in the performance assessment methodologies and measures and the unavailability of comprehensive information, which compromises the effective case management throughout the course of care, as well as independent evaluations and the backing for political decision-making [15,17]. The existence of a comprehensive set of healthcare data is a valuable information source that allows: healthcare managers to establish baseline conditions and highlight areas of concern, to recognize strategic changes which may be needed for the future course of actions and to improve human resourcesâ€™ management; and decision makers to indicate the results of action, to ensure that institutions can be held accountable to their plans, to assess current conditions and trends, to correct mistakes, and to reformulate ineffective policies. The availability and collection of such data would be a step to move from a fragmented healthcare system to a more coordinated arrangement between the different levels of healthcare provision. Being acknowledged as an outcome of complex and dynamic relations stimulated by several social, environmental and behavioural determinants at different levels of policy intervention, healthcare also needs to be tackled in a comprehensive way [25]. Governance is crucial to ensure integration of care and should be supported on adequate information indicators [19]. Previous studies on the governance arrangements within the Portuguese healthcare system show that health policies are still considered in a very centralized and hierarchical way, and very much within the healthcare sector boundaries (e.g. [22,25]). The pyramidal structure of the healthcare sector like a one-way passage and the inexistence of key indicators to strategically plan in advance health policies raise difficulties in fully implementing the policy agenda already mentioned. As such, the governance structures that characterize healthcare systems must force policy-makers to move out of their policy silos and provide improved solutions and data according to citizensâ€™ needs [9].

This result confirms what is sustained in literature, that highlights the systems fragmentation in the performance assessment methodologies and measures and the unavailability of comprehensive information, which compromises the effective case management throughout the course of care, as well as independent evaluations and the backing for political decision-making [15,17]. The existence of a comprehensive set of healthcare data is a valuable information source that allows: healthcare managers to establish baseline conditions and highlight areas of concern, to recognize strategic changes which may be needed for the future course of actions and to improve human resourcesâ€™ management; and decision makers to indicate the results of action, to ensure that institutions can be held accountable to their plans, to assess current conditions and trends, to correct mistakes, and to reformulate ineffective policies. The availability and collection of such data would be a step to move from a fragmented healthcare system to a more coordinated arrangement between the different levels of healthcare provision. Being acknowledged as an outcome of complex and dynamic relations stimulated by several social, environmental and behavioural determinants at different levels of policy intervention, healthcare also needs to be tackled in a comprehensive way [25]. Governance is crucial to ensure integration of care and should be supported on adequate information indicators [19]. Previous studies on the governance arrangements within the Portuguese healthcare system show that health policies are still considered in a very centralized and hierarchical way, and very much within the healthcare sector boundaries (e.g. [22,25]). The pyramidal structure of the healthcare sector like a one-way passage and the inexistence of key indicators to strategically plan in advance health policies raise difficulties in fully implementing the policy agenda already mentioned. As such, the governance structures that characterize healthcare systems must force policy-makers to move out of their policy silos and provide improved solutions and data according to citizensâ€™ needs [9].

Integrated care can be achieved by formal integration or from the combination and coordination of existing healthcare services. Irrespective of the possible approaches, integrated care demands efficient governance strategies in terms of planning and organizing care provision. Therefore, it is essential the existence of information (i.e., indicators) providing a comprehensive picture of the existing healthcare services, namely in terms of the quality of care integration. In this respect, the study reported by this paper aimed to assess the existing information indicators to support the governance of integrated care provision of the NUTS 3 Region of Aveiro, Portugal, by comparing their availability with other healthcare provision indicators of the same region. The results show that the indicators that are lacking focus mainly on continuous care, which means that the authorities do not have mechanisms to monitor, evaluate and improve the care integration, despite the respective emphasis in the political agenda.

Introduction Waiting times in healthcare institutions are sometimes considerably high. Multiple factors, namely population growth and ageing, as well as the lack of infrastructures, will promote the increase of waiting times [1]. Concerning the emergency departments, often associated to significant delays in the provision of healthcare, their waiting times constitute an essential indicator since they influence the clinical outcomes [2-4]. Notably, the waiting time for a diagnosis is a crucial factor for early treatment [5]. For instance, when dealing with a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) the first three hours after the onset of symptoms are essential for the treatment, as this is the time window that allows the clinical procedures to be effective [5-7]. Among the various factors that impact the celerity and quality of a diagnosis, the availability of clinical information, including medical imaging information, assumes great relevance [8]. The rapid changes and technological advances over the last few decades are particularly relevant in the field of medical imaging, as its workflows are supported by information systems, which means that communication networks, accessibility, information quality and reliability are increasingly relevant [9]. Concerning medical imaging, in addition to the Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems [10], the Radiological Information Systems (RIS), the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), and, in some cases, the Teleradiology systems, contribute to the quality of the healthcare provision. These systems are responsible for the studies management, namely for archiving and communicating digital images produced by the multiple modalities of the medical imaging departments, as well as for the management of imaging procedures, registration of consumables and archive of clinical reports [11-12]. For the optimization of stroke diagnosis and treatment medium-size , the action of the healthcare professionals must be coordinated, and the processes proceed as quickly, efficiently, and effectively as possible [13-14]. Therefore, the existence of systems to notify suspicious cases is essential to optimize the processes, particularly before the patient arrives at the hospital [15-17], but also at the intra-hospital level, namely by notifying specific teams [18], as well as to monitor the duration of the different procedures [19-20]. Much of the pertinent information related to the stroke patients is distributed by the databases of various information systems, namely RIS, PACS, Teleradiology or EHR, so these systems are very relevant resources for collecting data pertinent for the analysis of the processes over time [20-21]. The main objective of the research study reported by this paper was to evaluate whether the data related to medical imaging studies in a medium-size hospital can be used to characterization the procedures being performed, as well as to identify points of improvement, namely in the context of the acute stroke diagnosis and treatment. Six sections compose this paper: in section two, the importance of the rapidly medical imaging studies execution in a stroke scenario, namely those related to Head Computed Tomography (Head CT) and Angio Computed Tomography (Angio CT) studies, is addressed; in section three the used materials and methods are presented; sections four presents the results; and section five is devoted to their discussion and to draw some conclusion. 2. Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the standard definition of stroke as a focal or global neurological impairment, of vascular origin, which can lead to stroke death, caused by an interruption of blood supply to the brain [22]. Stroke is currently the most significant cause of death across Europe and is also the leading cause of disability due to the countless physical, mental, and social sequelae, which restrict functionality in the adult population [23]. Several epidemiological studies, carried out worldwide, made it possible to calculate an average stroke incidence of 200 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year [24-25]. In Portugal, given the relevance of a rapid provision of care to victims of stroke in the acute phase, the Stroke Green Way was created in 2008 [26]. It is a coordinated strategy to improve the referral and treatment of emerging patients, with a suspicious stroke clinical condition, in the pre-hospital, intra-hospital and inter-hospital phases [27]. Process mapping is an exercise to identify all stages and decisions of a process so that it can be continuously improved [28]. In the scope of healthcare services, process mapping is important as good processes tend to be translated into an overall improvement in the provision of healthcare [29]. On the other hand, process mapping allows to understand the reality of the services through the description of their functionality and workflows Diana Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 363â€“370 365 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 management [30]. Moreover, the use of modelling and simulation tools for workflows allows both the analysis of workflows already implemented and their restructuring, as well as virtual simulation of new workflows, namely the ones required to carry out medical imaging studies [1,31]. Long waiting times related to a large flow of patients in need of care are also a common problem in medical imaging departments [31]. In the context of Heath CT studies requested by the emergency departments, the lack of response capacity in carrying out these studies can have a significant impact on patientsâ€™ waiting times [6]. Since inefficient management of workflows generates long waiting times and inefficient responsiveness in the provision of healthcare [32], the use of software tools to manage workflows might allow the balancing of workloads and can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the available medical imaging services [33]. According to Goyal et al [7], detailed analysis of workflows with interactive feedback, as well as the establishment of time targets, can contribute to better outcomes. In this context, optimization procedures can promote the improvement of treatment duration and the potential for recovery [34-35]. The accurate and timely interpretation of Head CT studies in a stroke scenario contributes positively to treatment efficiency. Therefore, time management, teamwork and compliance with standardized institutional protocols, contribute to improve results. The existence of multidisciplinary protocols when performing Head CT in the context of acute stroke, seems to contribute to the reduction of response time, providing an improvement in clinical results [36]. The use of the data contained in information systems for the optimization of workflows, namely in terms of medical imaging, can be translated into added value for patients, particularly those with suspected stroke in the acute phase. 3. Materials and Methods The research study reported by this paper was authorized by the board of directors of a medium-size hospital after being approved by the respective ethics committee. The anonymity of the healthcare professionals and patients involved in the studies was fully guaranteed. Head CT studies carried out over a year on patients with suspected stroke, integrated into the hospital Stroke Green Way, were analysed in the period from August 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018. Initially, the mapping of the processes and information systems used to support the carry out of Head CT studies of patients with suspected acute stroke was done. Since in some stroke conditions it is also required Angio CT, the processes and information systems used to support the carry out of Angio CT studies were also mapped. Subsequently, data fields were identified belonging to RIS, PACS and Teleradiology databases. This allowed data aggregation for the characterisation of process and subprocesses associated to the Head CT and Angio CT studies performed in the context of suspected stroke in the acute phase. Finally, the duration of the different processes and subprocesses and their contribution to the development of alerts that could be used in the clinical context were analysed. 4. Results Head CT studies conducted on 464 patients were analysed: 245 (52.8%) males and 219 females (47.2%). Of these patients, 198 (42.7%) also performed Angio CT. When analysing the data related to the retrieved studies, a set of fields were identified in the RIS, PACS and Teleradiology databases and were considered to feed the Stroke Database after an anonymization process (Fig. 1). In terms of process characterisation, the request for the Head CT study carried out at RIS was considered the starting point. When the patient arrives at the CT room, requisition data is sent to the imaging equipment and the study is performed. At the end of the images acquisition, the study is considered completed being registered in the RIS as â€œexecutedâ€�. After the transmission of the images to the PACS database, the study is sent to the Teleradiology system. Depending on the results of the Head CT, the patient may be a candidate for Angio CT and endovascular treatment. Therefore, when an Angio CT is also required, it is performed after the realization of the Head CT. Within the scope of the research study reported by this paper, two processes were considered: Head CT process (P1) and Angio CT process (P2): â€¢ P1 - Process characterized by the time interval elapsed from the moment the study is requested and the 366 Diana Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 363â€“370 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 moment it is validated in the RIS, that is, when the medical report is available: Patient transport to the imaging department (subprocess P1.1) - Time interval elapsed from the moment the Head CT is requested, and the moment the study starts on the CT equipment. Perform Head CT (subprocess P1.2) - The time interval between the beginning of the acquisition of images on the equipment and the closure of the study at RIS. Head CT reporting execution (subprocess P1.3) - Time interval elapsed between the moment of study archive completion at the Teleradiology system and the study validation moment at the RIS. Head CT Report Validation (subprocess P1.4) - Time interval elapsed between the moment of the study execution and its validation at the RIS (i.e., the moment when the report is obtained). â€¢ P2 - Process characterized by the time interval between the moment when the Head CT study is performed and the end of the Angio CT study (including images post-processing): Angio CT decision time (subprocess P2.1) - Time interval that elapses between the execution of Head CT and the request of an Angio CT. Angio CT procedure (including images post-processing) (subprocess P2.2) - Time interval that elapses between the start of image acquisition from Angio CT and the completion the post-processing of the images.

In turn, Table 2 shows the statistical results of the time spent in Head CT studies (P1) and Angio CT procedures (P2). Diana Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 363â€“370 367 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 From the results, it is possible to identify the maximum time values of both processes carried out within the scope of the Stroke Green Way initiative. Although the maximum time values are high, 25% of the patients that underwent a Head CT study obtained the respective report in less than 30 minutes. In the case of patients whose clinical decision determined the need for an Angio CT, this process was completed in less than ten minutes for 25% of the patients. Moreover, 25% of the patients that performed Head CT waited for the report for more than 52 minutes, and of those who performed Angio TC, 75% completed this process in less than 19 minutes (Table 2). The statistical analysis of the duration of the different subprocesses being considered are presented in Table 3. In this table, it is possible to identify significant maximum time values. For example, a patient waited five hours and 24 minutes to enter to the CT room and another patient waited three hours and 38 minutes for the report. Table 2.

In some cases, significant standard deviations were identified, namely regarding the waiting time to enter to the CT room and the waiting time for the report, which has repercussions on the mean and median values. Regarding the decision times for performing Angio CT, for 75% of the patients, this time was less than five minutes (Table 3). 368 Diana Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 363â€“370 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5. Discussion and Conclusion It is vital to build process maps in order to understand better the medical imaging workflows of a given institution, as well as identifying factors responsible for workflow congestion and possible points for improvement [6-7,29,32,33]. Within the scope of the research study reported by this paper, the processes mapping of the requisition and the realization of medical imaging studiesâ€™ of acute stroke victims enabled a better understanding of the paths taken by the patients in the hospital, particularly in the medical imaging department and regarding the Stroke Green Way initiative. There are studies that evaluate the average times associated to the realization of Head CT as well as studies that evaluate the elapsed time since the entry into the healthcare unit of patients with suspected stroke in the acute phase until the realization of the Head CT and the beginning of the treatment [6, 34, 36]. However, the processes that involve conducting studies in the context of acute stroke do not appear in detail in the literature [36]. In the case of the Head CT characterisation it was possible to identify procedures that can promote delays, which might negatively impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected acute stroke. The different databases that can be used to characterize the medical imaging processes makes it possible to identify situations that may represent points for improvement and to identify good practices to be emphasized and disseminate. In a context where it is imperative to have the diagnosis in the shortest possible time, it is essential that the results should be viewed holistically and considering that multiple factors can influence the celerity of the realization of the procedures. Some of these factors may be related to the availability of material and human resources, information assets, but also to the existence of efficient workflow processes in related areas, such as, for example, in the realization of clinical laboratory tests. Considering the results of the research study reported by this paper, it is possible to infer that the clinical databases have suitable data to characterize the duration of the different processes. The aggregation of data from different systems allowed to characterize the duration of the different procedures, but also to identify situations (individual and collective ones) that may deserve special attention. In this respect, carefully analyses should be performed about the causes of excessive delays that occurred for some patients. From the moment the study is requested until the patient enters the CT room (P1.1), there is significant variability in the time spent (SD - 28 min), and 25% of the patients wait more than 20 minutes before the beginning of the study. In this subprocess, the identification of a patient that wait five hours and 24 minutes entering the room may deserve special attention. The same reasoning can be used for the analysis of the other subprocesses. The use of statistical measures of dispersion allowed a global analysis of the times associated with the different processes and subprocesses, but also the identification of potential good practices. If the standard deviation values give a perspective of the variability associated with the performance of the procedures, the minimum values and those related to the 1st quartile (Table 2) values can be indicators of good practices, which may help to determine the factors that influenced a rapid realization of the procedures. On the other hand, the maximum values and the 3rd quartile may be pertinent for the identification of exceptional situations and may also be important for the identification of tendencies that can be associated to the adoption of inefficient procedural strategies. Regarding the studiesâ€™ execution time, the values obtained show that, in general, the processes are efficient, both in the Head CT study (average of five minutes) and in the Angio CT studies (average of ten minutes). However, for some patients, it was identified delays much longer than the average. Moreover, situations with minimum values of zero minutes were identified. These situations occur when the process is considered complete in one information system (e.g., RIS), but has not yet completed in another information system (e.g., PACS). Sometimes, for process speed optimization, the study is often Executed (considered as completed) at RIS even before the study acquisition completion at the equipment occurred and, consequently at the PACS. These scenarios promote sub-processes with minimum execution times of zero minutes. The time associated with some sub-processes carried out within the scope of the Stroke Green Way initiative, namely before the patient's arrival at the medical imaging department (e.g. patient transportation and laboratory data acquisition) contributes significantly to higher waiting time to diagnosis. The fact that the processes are all dependent on each other, a punctual poor performance in a specific subprocess can compromise the whole process, since it is the sum of the time spent in all processes that give the relevant data to determine how long it takes to conclude a diagnosis. Diana Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 177 (2020) 363â€“370 369 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 7 The data collected allowed to identify situations that may represent good practices in the provision of healthcare, namely in the context of the celerity in obtaining a diagnosis. There are also situations that may represent points for improvement, namely those related to situations that demonstrate the need for medical imaging department external processes improvement like, for example, those related with the referring physician department performance but also related with procedures taken before the patient arrives at the hospital [15-17]. The analysis of the of RIS, PACS and Teleradiology data and the statistical analysis of the duration of the various processes allow to infer the potential of their use in terms of continuous improvement of healthcare processes, namely those designed for potential stroke victims. As future work, we anticipate the relevance of developing automatic, real-time alert systems contribute to the promotion and adoption of best practices, as well as the identification of situations that may promote the deterioration of the health conditions of the patients as well as compromising their prognosis in multiple clinical contexts, namely beyond stroke.

The main objective of the research study reported by this paper was to evaluate whether the data resulting from the processes related to urgent medical imaging studies of a medium-size hospital can support the characterisation of the procedures performed, as well as the identification of points of improvement, specifically in the context of stroke clinical situations. Data related to Head Computed Tomography (Head CT) and Angio Computed Tomography (Angio CT) studies carried out over a year (from August 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018) on 464 patients with suspected acute stroke were aggregated and analysed. The results of the statistical analysis of the duration of the different processes and subprocesses demonstrate significant variability (i.e., 47±37 minutes and median of 38 minutes for Head CT and 23±55 minutes and median of 13 minutes for Angio CT). According to the results, it seems that aggregated data from the different information systems supporting medical imaging procedures should be used for continuous practice improvement.

The study reported in this paper analysed the shifting process from a typical paper registration to a registration performed by a web-based platform (i.e., the Ankira® platform) in a Portuguese social care institution. In order to gather evidence and best practices, 13630 registries were analysed, 6390 in paper format and 7240 from the web-based platform. The results show that the shifting from paper to the web-based platform lead to a significant error rate decline in all type of registers, which demonstrates the significant impact of the introduction of information technologies to support social care provision.",

Methodological quality assessment is a common practice in the field of health for different designs and types of studies. However, we were unable to find a scale to assess the methodological quality of studies on the usability of eHealth products or services. Objective: This study aimed to develop a scale to assess the methodological quality of studies assessing usability of mobile apps and to perform a preliminary analysis of of the scale’s feasibility, reliability, and construct validity on studies assessing usability of mobile apps, measuring aspects of physical activity. Methods: A 3-round Delphi panel was used to generate a pool of items considered important when assessing the quality of studies on the usability of mobile apps. These items were used to write the scale and the guide to assist its use. The scale was then used to assess the quality of studies on usability of mobile apps for physical activity, and it assessed in terms of feasibility, interrater reliability, and construct validity. Results: A total of 25 experts participated in the Delphi panel, and a 15-item scale was developed. This scale was shown to be feasible (time of application mean 13.10 [SD 2.59] min), reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.81; 95% CI 0.55-0.93), and able to discriminate between low- and high-quality studies (high quality: mean 9.22 [SD 0.36]; low quality: mean 6.86 [SD 0.80]; P=.01). Conclusions: The scale that was developed can be used both to assess the methodological quality of usability studies and to inform its planning.",

This study investigates the association between chronic pain at different body regions and self-reported PA, screen based time and sleeping hours in high school students. A total of 969 students aged 13-19 years old. Participants completed a questionnaire on chronic pain, time spent in moderate and vigorous PA, screen based time watching televivsion (TV)/digital versatile discs (DVD), playing, using mobile phones and computers and sleeping hours. Univariate and multivariate associations between pain and PA, screen based time and sleeping hours were investigated. In the univariate model time spent in moderate and vigorous PA, in screen based activities and sleeping were associated with pain in at least one body site. In the multivariate model, screen based activities were not associated with pain; sleeping 7 h or less and increased time in moderate PA were associated with pain at almost all body sites [odds ratio (OR) between 2.69-3.66 and 1.06-1.10, respectively]. Time spent in PA and sleeping increased the risk of chronic pain in almost all body regions and might confound the association between screen based time and pain.",

The study reported in this article aimed to assess the quality of Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) metadata related to medical imaging stakeholder’s characterisation, particularly in terms of what attributes are available and their usage trends. The DICOM metadata of medical imaging exams carried out in a medium size hospital during a one-year period (i.e. 5 144 417 images, corresponding to 97 612 exams performed on 61 256 patients) were analysed. The results show that the use of the DICOM attributes for health care stakeholder’s characterisation varies with the medical imaging modalities, concerning the number of available attributes, and respective usage levels and data quality. Therefore, the filling in of DICOM metadata could be optimised, which may be relevant for the clinical practice as well as for the development of data bases that might support clinical research.",

Conceivably, using disability-related variables to predict future healthcare utilization could contribute to reduce both older adults’ disability and healthcare costs. This study aimed to explore the association between aspects of disability and older adults’ primary healthcare utilization and hospitalization over a period of 1 year. Methods: Older adults (n = 129) were assessed for self-reported disability, lower limb performance, pain intensity and number of painful body sites, depressive symptoms, and self-reported physical activity. Data on primary healthcare utilization and hospitalization were collected for the period of 1 year through registries and phone interviews. Results: Regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, showed that self-reported disability and pain intensity were significantly associated with total primary healthcare utilization and together with a confounding variable (number of chronic conditions) explained 16% of its variance (p < 0.05). Increased physical activity was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of being admitted to hospital (95% CI for exponentiation (B) = 0.27–0.81). Discussion: Data suggest that decreasing self-reported disability and increasing physical activity may decrease primary healthcare utilization and hospitalization, respectively.",

Introduction Nowadays, ehealth services are supported by multiple systems with overlapping functionalities. Therefore, interoperability is a key area to ensure harmonized solutions [1]. Concerning interoperability standardization, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) [2] developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7) presents improvements when compared to existing solutions, namely HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) or HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). In fact, FHIR allows concise and easy-to-understand specifications, as well as implementations based on well-established web standards (e.g. Extensible Markup Language â€“ XML, Java Script Object Notation â€“ JSON, or Representational State Transfer â€“ REST). In this way, FHIR is suitable for a variety of contexts [3]. The present article reports a study with the objective of using FHIR to guarantee interoperability of a platform of services, the Social Cooperation for Integrated Assisted Living (SOCIAL) platform, aiming to provide information services to support integrated care and assistance of community-dwelling older adults [4]. Particularly, the integration of FHIR with complex authentication, authorization, logging and auditing mechanisms is described and a performance evaluation of the respective implementation is presented. 2. Related Work During the last decades, the exponential rise in computing availability, cheaper digital storage and broadband communications networking made possible the implementation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) across health care organizations. This evolution promotes patient-centered health care provision, by allowing different services to share clinical information [5]. Clinical information sharing is not seamless due to various technical difficulties, being information interoperability one of the major technical challenges. Interoperability problems go beyond the interoperability of hospital information systems because, as a consequence of the epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases, the remote care provision of chronic patients in their homes assumes a paramount importance. In this context, concepts such as â€œconnected healthâ€� or â€œholistic healthâ€� [6, 7] promote patient-oriented and holistic solutions to manage mutual awareness and shared objectives among care receivers and formal and informal caregivers [8]. These solutions require an effective cooperation not only among health care and social care formal caregivers but also among formal and informal caregivers, which is complex due to the lack of unified models, concepts and terminologies. To ensure reusability of information models and consistent definition of content and validation rules, there are different suitable models, such as CDA, Continuity of Care Record (CCR) or Continuity of Care Document (CCD). CDA intends to specify both the structure and semantics of the patientâ€™s data as a clinical document for exchange using HL7 v2 or v3 messages. In turn, CCR allows the capture of the patient health summary (e.g. problems, medications, allergies or care plans) together with current health status, and it is intended to improve continuity of patient care, by reducing medical errors and assuring a minimum health information transportability when a patient is referred or transferred [9]. Finally, CCD was developed by HL7 to combine the benefits of CCR and CDA [5]. Europe has also developed multiple health care standards, such as: Health informatics - Electronic Health Record Communication (EN 13606) [10], which defines an information architecture for communicating part or all EHR with other systems; Health Informatics - System of Concepts to Support Continuity of Care (EN 13940-1) to provide a standard terminology for planning, delivering and following-up the activities that form the continuity of care processes [11]; Health Informatics Service Architecture (HISA) [12], a standard based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) to provide guidance on the development of modular open information systems; and openEHR [13], an EHR specification and implementation based on the archetype concept. During the last years, FHIR has been subject of an increasing interest because it is based on web technologies and presents a focus on ease of implementation. These characteristics make development of models for clinical application easier for developers compared to more specialized and comprehensive models such as RIM or openEHR [1]. In addition, FHIR helps to bridge the gap to standard-based legacy systems by its ability to map to other HL7 standards, Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 524â€“531 525 Available online at www.sciencedirect.com ScienceDirect Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 www.elsevier.com/locate/procedia 1877-0509 Â© 2019 The Authors.

These characteristics make development of models for clinical application easier for developers compared to more specialized and comprehensive models such as RIM or openEHR [1]. In addition, FHIR helps to bridge the gap to standard-based legacy systems by its ability to map to other HL7 standards, 526 Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 524â€“531 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 such as the CDA and, as it is built to be supported by REST architectures and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), it is especially suitable for mobile applications [1]. Moreover, FHIR is an optimal standard for intermediate communication in terms of the complete communication chain from the personal health device up to complex ehealth infrastructures like hospital information systems or EHR systems [14]. Both are putting intense efforts in the integration of FHIR in their specifications for data exchange between personal health devices and health information systems. The basic building block of a FHIR document is a resource. Resources have a wide range of uses, from clinical content, such as care plans or diagnostics. Not fully compatible resources can be adapted to the desired context using FHIR extensions, which grants the ability to readjust the existent structure to one that fits specific requirements [1]. In turn, FHIR documents are built from a set of resources that, either by themselves or combined, satisfy the majority of common use cases. If interoperability standards allow the transfer and share of clinical information, it should also be kept in mind the need to consider authentication, authorization, logging and auditing mechanisms to ensure privacy, integrity and confidentiality of personal information. In this aspect, control mechanisms such as Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) or Role-based Access Control (RBAC), and technologies such as blockchain [15] or eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [16] have been applied to avoid unauthorized accesses of EHR [17, 18]. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the performance of the information transfer mechanisms that were implemented for the SOCIAL platform, which has an FHIR gateway with suitable security mechanism to provide interoperable care receiverâ€™s information. 3. Proposed Solution Different types of services are required for the care networks of community-dwelling older adults, from complex health care or social care services to simple specialized assistance services such as, for example, housekeeping. For that, several interacting organizational structures may co-exist, including formal care networks (e.g. health or social organizations and caregivers), regulated by collaboration contracts or agreements, a wide range of public and private services and assistant providers (e.g. transport services, namely personal transportation and delivery of goods at home, or assistance providers addressing less tangible values such as participation, including social, religious, civic and political participation of older adults), informal care providers resulting from a diversity of community-oriented structures (e.g. relatives, friends, voluntary groups or non-governmental organizations), and authorities and supporters dealing with socio-economical and legal context of care provision, including legislative and public welfare organizations, financial bodies or supporting organizations. For the development of the SOCIAL platform the following functional requirements were considered [4, 19]: â€¢ Support of the caregiving cycle of community-dwelling older adults, from maintaining healthy lifestyles to institutionalization. â€¢ Integration, when required, of health and social care information records. â€¢ Empowerment of assisted persons and their informal caregivers by providing them the information they need. â€¢ Access by formal care providers to relevant care receiverâ€™s information. â€¢ Information sharing and exchange between multidisciplinary teams. â€¢ Improved communication between care organizations and local authorities. â€¢ Comprehensive repository of health and social care information to allow analytical processing in order to obtain evidence on the effectiveness of actions and policies being developed and the respective impact in terms of quality of life of the citizens. Additionally, a range of non-functional requirement was considered. This include ethical and regulatory, quality, interoperability, conformance and use or deployment requirements. Following the applicable regulations (e.g. EU Directive 2016/679 on the protection of individuals that entered into force in May 2018) regarding the processing of personal data and the movement of such data, several principles were considered to guarantee the privacy of the individuals, namely openness, transparency, inviolability of the information being managed, and individual participation. User experience, availability, accessibility, integrity, performance, reliability, security, and regulatory 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 compliance were considered in terms of quality related requirements. In particular, it was considered the need of customized and personalized user interfaces with consistent look-and-feel interaction and navigation across all the applications. Moreover, the integration of information from public and private institutions with different professional, organizational and jurisdictional nature requires reliable interoperability mechanisms, which means that both the technologies being used, and the understanding of the collected information, processes, activities and policies must be in compliance with internationally available standards. Finally, since a primary goal of the SOCIAL platform is to be technically feasible and economically viable, it was considered characteristics such as extensibility, reusability, configurability, flexibility, and maintainability. Without common and shared software architectural standards, data formats, storage systems, modules and information resources, development and integration is difficult. Not integrated software components often promote replicated data in diverse data formats and storage systems. Also, different systems, although with similar architectures, might be supported in own software modules with proprietary data formats. Moreover, although standards might be used to guarantee interoperability between different data formats the complexity of the integration made development slow and expensive, which difficult the implementation of the desired functions. To overcome these difficulties the development of the SOCIAL platform was based on a SOA approach, which presents several advantages, since it can optimize flexibility and interoperability of the components over the longer term. Furthermore, the use of an n-tier SOA allows the separation of business rules from the applications and the technologies that interpret them, which maximizes flexibility and minimizes the cost of accommodating changes in business rules, and, therefore, allows the development of specific applications without significant development effort. The generic system architecture of the SOCIAL platform was divided into three layers. The application layer comprises a set of applications to fulfil the needs of the SOCIAL platform stakeholders, including web and mobile applications that are responsible for the information exchange between the platform and its users. The business layer is responsible for all logic related to the interactions between the different applications and the data persisted in the SOCIAL platform. The data layer ensures the persistence of all information used in the remaining layers and it is divided into a set of databases, each housing specific data about a given goal. Figure 1. Services of the business layer. In order to be possible the development of different applications, the business layer exposes a set of services that allow communication with the applications, namely a FHIR gateway (i.e. validation, storage, reconstitution and search of information directly related to the care receivers) that interacts with authentication, authorization, logging and auditing mechanisms (Fig. 1).

Services of the business layer. In order to be possible the development of different applications, the business layer exposes a set of services that allow communication with the applications, namely a FHIR gateway (i.e. validation, storage, reconstitution and search of information directly related to the care receivers) that interacts with authentication, authorization, logging and auditing mechanisms (Fig. 1). 528 Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 524â€“531 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 Different technologies (e.g. Java, Maven, REST, Spring Boot, Spring Data or MongoDB) were used to develop the FHIR gateway, which provide a service for sending and receiving assisted personsâ€™ information. The FHIR gateway supports the Create, Read, Delete and Update (CRUD) data operations. Besides these operations, an advanced search is also allowed, with specific search parameters associated to each resource, in order to reduce search area and obtain more specific information. In each request a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) that follows the standard RFC 7519 [20] is required (Fig. 2). Every time that a request arrives, the JWT is validated in order to be possible the access to the requested information [21]. The previous procedure is one of the security measures in order to confine the data to undue requests. Moreover, the requests are all submitted to the authorization service so the information can be retrieved according to permissions associated to a specific role. Once again, the JWT is used to get the role and other information that is sent to authorization service that applies the access control rules and decides if the information can or cannot be achieved. According to the response of this service, the FHIR gateway is responsible for sending, as response to the initial request, the requested information that can be accessed. Considering a Read request, some fields can be omitted according to userâ€™s permissions. The other operations (i.e. Create, Update or Delete) can be permitted or denied. The authentication component is supported by the REST architecture and allows the registration of specific users in the SOCIAL platform, the assignment of the respective roles and the verification of their identities. If a user's authentication is successfully validated, the service returns a JWT. The JWT enables the secure exchange of information between parties and has the required attributes for the verification of the user's identity so that they can be authorized to access specific applications or information (Fig. 2). In particular, one of the available JWT attributes is the role that identifies the profile with which the user is currently operating. The role acts as a permission aggregator that is managed by the authorization component. A JWT should be present in all the communications between the various components of the SOCIAL platform, so each one of these components holds an encrypted private key to verify veracity and validity of the JWT they received. The FHIR resources may have security labels for three different purposes: to indicate the permissions related to information operations, such as Create or Read, to indicate what resources can be returned, and to indicate how specific information should be dealt with. Requests can also add their own security labels (e.g. break-the-glass protocol to allow a physician dealing with an emergency to access information of patient even when has not access permissions). The security labels can have different categorizations, such as confidentiality, sensitivity, compartment, integrity or handling. Integrating ABAC mechanisms with this standard is possible, since the FHIR resources are also defined by their attributes. The main purpose of the authorization service is to provide general mechanisms to control the access to the SOCIAL platform, which is an environment composed by a significant number of dispersed resources that can be accessed by a broad range of users that are distributed, both in geographical terms and in the administrative terms. The requirements initially established stated that authorization should be robust to ensure privacy, integrity and confidentiality of the information, allow the access to remote information in a friendly and transparent way, be easy to maintain and present a strong granularity in terms of the definition of different authorization levels. The XACML [16] is a standard that allows handling requests, regarding data access, using an ABAC policy language. These requests related to the access of specific resources are analyzed through a set of rules, so that a decision can be achieved. By using XACML, pre-established rules can be divided into different categories. The decision for the access request is obtained after comparing all the values of the attributes of the respective categories, between the request and the previously defined rules. Depending on how a specific decision rule was defined, a request result could be a denial or a permit (Fig. 2). Furthermore, policies and their respective rules can have different levels of detail, according to the different number of attributes needed before reaching a decision. This feature makes this standard a perfect fit for systems that handle great quantities of information, with different types of data. Finally, the logging and auditing component, as the remainder components, is based on a REST architecture, allowing the communication of the different services and applications of the SOCIAL platform via HTTP (Fig. 2). A cryptographic secure blockchain was adopted, which stores the events and the blocks (of the blockchain) in a special purpose database. Moreover, audit processes will access the stored events and blocks to determine the relevant data. For that three separate processes were considered: log insertion, log consensus and log audit. Log audit is done by direct observation of the event stream stored in the database. Existing tools such as Kibana can be used and the integrity of the data observed can be assured. The integrity of the chain can be verified anytime to 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 check for any inconsistencies. Since every block of the chain has a clear identification, with fingerprints of the log data, as well as time stamps of the first and last event during that time period, the hash of all the events occurred between two checkpoints can be recalculated to check if it matches the one stored in the block. The next and previous hash fields on every block can also be used to verify if the block itself has not been tampered. Figure 2. Required flow to access information from the FHIR gateway. 4. Results The first application scenario to be considered within the deployment of the SOCIAL is related to the social support provided by local authorities to community-dwelling older adults. In fact, the assistance and social care services provided by local authorities assume a paramount importance, since they are one of the resources for the first contact with the population and are involved in organizing and planning activities or providing financial support and direct assistance when needed [22, 23]. The two city councils that have been cooperating in the study reported by this article have in common program offices, which intend to offer programs and activities. Programs are initiatives composed by different types of activities, such as physical activity (e.g. swimming or trekking) or sociocultural activities (e.g. theatre or dance), aiming to promote the quality of life of older adults living independently. In a simple way, the following actors and respective uses cases were considered for the program offices [24]: i) assisted persons and their informal caregivers (i.e. information access, applying, registration, withdrawal, or provision Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 524â€“531 529 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 Different technologies (e.g. Java, Maven, REST, Spring Boot, Spring Data or MongoDB) were used to develop the FHIR gateway, which provide a service for sending and receiving assisted personsâ€™ information. The FHIR gateway supports the Create, Read, Delete and Update (CRUD) data operations. Besides these operations, an advanced search is also allowed, with specific search parameters associated to each resource, in order to reduce search area and obtain more specific information. In each request a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) that follows the standard RFC 7519 [20] is required (Fig. 2). Every time that a request arrives, the JWT is validated in order to be possible the access to the requested information [21]. The previous procedure is one of the security measures in order to confine the data to undue requests. Moreover, the requests are all submitted to the authorization service so the information can be retrieved according to permissions associated to a specific role. Once again, the JWT is used to get the role and other information that is sent to authorization service that applies the access control rules and decides if the information can or cannot be achieved. According to the response of this service, the FHIR gateway is responsible for sending, as response to the initial request, the requested information that can be accessed. Considering a Read request, some fields can be omitted according to userâ€™s permissions. The other operations (i.e. Create, Update or Delete) can be permitted or denied. The authentication component is supported by the REST architecture and allows the registration of specific users in the SOCIAL platform, the assignment of the respective roles and the verification of their identities. If a user's authentication is successfully validated, the service returns a JWT. The JWT enables the secure exchange of information between parties and has the required attributes for the verification of the user's identity so that they can be authorized to access specific applications or information (Fig. 2). In particular, one of the available JWT attributes is the role that identifies the profile with which the user is currently operating. The role acts as a permission aggregator that is managed by the authorization component. A JWT should be present in all the communications between the various components of the SOCIAL platform, so each one of these components holds an encrypted private key to verify veracity and validity of the JWT they received. The FHIR resources may have security labels for three different purposes: to indicate the permissions related to information operations, such as Create or Read, to indicate what resources can be returned, and to indicate how specific information should be dealt with. Requests can also add their own security labels (e.g. break-the-glass protocol to allow a physician dealing with an emergency to access information of patient even when has not access permissions). The security labels can have different categorizations, such as confidentiality, sensitivity, compartment, integrity or handling. Integrating ABAC mechanisms with this standard is possible, since the FHIR resources are also defined by their attributes. The main purpose of the authorization service is to provide general mechanisms to control the access to the SOCIAL platform, which is an environment composed by a significant number of dispersed resources that can be accessed by a broad range of users that are distributed, both in geographical terms and in the administrative terms. The requirements initially established stated that authorization should be robust to ensure privacy, integrity and confidentiality of the information, allow the access to remote information in a friendly and transparent way, be easy to maintain and present a strong granularity in terms of the definition of different authorization levels. The XACML [16] is a standard that allows handling requests, regarding data access, using an ABAC policy language. These requests related to the access of specific resources are analyzed through a set of rules, so that a decision can be achieved. By using XACML, pre-established rules can be divided into different categories. The decision for the access request is obtained after comparing all the values of the attributes of the respective categories, between the request and the previously defined rules. Depending on how a specific decision rule was defined, a request result could be a denial or a permit (Fig. 2). Furthermore, policies and their respective rules can have different levels of detail, according to the different number of attributes needed before reaching a decision. This feature makes this standard a perfect fit for systems that handle great quantities of information, with different types of data. Finally, the logging and auditing component, as the remainder components, is based on a REST architecture, allowing the communication of the different services and applications of the SOCIAL platform via HTTP (Fig. 2). A cryptographic secure blockchain was adopted, which stores the events and the blocks (of the blockchain) in a special purpose database. Moreover, audit processes will access the stored events and blocks to determine the relevant data. For that three separate processes were considered: log insertion, log consensus and log audit. Log audit is done by direct observation of the event stream stored in the database. Existing tools such as Kibana can be used and the integrity of the data observed can be assured. The integrity of the chain can be verified anytime to 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 check for any inconsistencies. Since every block of the chain has a clear identification, with fingerprints of the log data, as well as time stamps of the first and last event during that time period, the hash of all the events occurred between two checkpoints can be recalculated to check if it matches the one stored in the block. The next and previous hash fields on every block can also be used to verify if the block itself has not been tampered. Figure 2. Required flow to access information from the FHIR gateway. 4. Results The first application scenario to be considered within the deployment of the SOCIAL is related to the social support provided by local authorities to community-dwelling older adults. In fact, the assistance and social care services provided by local authorities assume a paramount importance, since they are one of the resources for the first contact with the population and are involved in organizing and planning activities or providing financial support and direct assistance when needed [22, 23]. The two city councils that have been cooperating in the study reported by this article have in common program offices, which intend to offer programs and activities. Programs are initiatives composed by different types of activities, such as physical activity (e.g. swimming or trekking) or sociocultural activities (e.g. theatre or dance), aiming to promote the quality of life of older adults living independently. In a simple way, the following actors and respective uses cases were considered for the program offices [24]: i) assisted persons and their informal caregivers (i.e. information access, applying, registration, withdrawal, or provision 530 Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 524â€“531 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 of feedback about programs and activities); ii) operational assistants (i.e. provision of information of certain activities to potential participants, enrolment and registration of participants, provision of feedback about the progress of programs and activities, and access to plans and notifications); iii) technicians of the city council (i.e. creation, allocation of human, material and economic resources, calculations of the costs, monitoring and submission of programs and activities, and access to notifications); and iv) members of the city council (i.e. approval of programs and activities, evaluation of ongoing programs and activities, and access to notifications). As a consequence of the requirementsâ€™ analysis of the programs and activities scenario, three different applications were considered: i) MySocial, a mobile and web application targeting assisted persons and their informal caregivers, aiming to provide a comprehensive but configurable set of functions; ii) SocialOperationManagement, a web application targeting care providers; and iii) SocialPlanning, a web application focused on the secondary use of information. These applications manage different types of information, such as, for example, demographic information (e.g. name, date of birth, gender, marital status, profession, schooling, household, nationality, identification document, address, telephone or email), personal factors (e.g. physical conditions, lifestyles, habits, facing problems skills, social background, or past and present life events), or data that characterize specific programs, activities, situations or events. To validate the proposed solution a test scenario was created consisting of a random number of users (between 100 and 200 users) that for 60 minutes randomly accessed three concurrent applications (i.e. MySocial, SocialOperationManagement and SocialPlanning). This test scenario was created to answer the following questions: â€¢ For each user profile, what is the average delay time between a platform access with a token and the reception of the indication of all the operations that the specific profile can perform? â€¢ What is the average delay time between a request to access a specific packet of information stored in the FHIR gateway and the complete reception of all the information by the requesting application? Table 1 present the average delay time obtained for each profile when performing a platform access with a token (i.e. to execute the flow from â€˜platform access with tokenâ€™ until â€˜show authorized menusâ€™ tabsâ€™ as presented in Fig. 2). As it can be seen the average time varied from 111.2 ms (i.e. assisted persons) to 120.4 ms (i.e. members of the city council), due to the different number and type of operations that each profile can perform. In turn, in what concerns the second question, the delay time for accessing a 368 kb packet containing a list of available programs (i.e. the flow from â€˜CRUD operationâ€™ until â€˜show resultsâ€™ as presented in Fig. 2) varied from 257.2 ms and 600.7 ms and assumed an average value of 458.9 ms. The results show that even with large quantities of events in short periods of time, the SOCIAL platform can successful manage the access of the different user-application pairs. Therefore, the proposed solution is efficient in terms of information accessing, which means that it can support an application ecosystem. Table 1. Average delay time obtained for each profile. Profile Average time (ms) Assisted persons 111.2 Informal caregiver 112.9 Operational assistants 113.9 Technicians of the city council 114.3 Members of the city council 120.4 5. Conclusion The authors developed a platform of services, the SOCIAL platform, which provides repositories of assisted personsâ€™ information compatible with FHIR specifications. Although FHIR is a specification for communication and interoperability, the use of the respective resources presents several advantages, namely compliance with established international standards, and information modelling using entities that are already mature and prepared to guarantee interoperability between applications. Moreover, the 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 FHIR specification provides a simplified abstraction of information records with normalized elements that the applications developers can understand. However, the real use of FHIR also means the need to guarantee privacy, integrity and confidentiality of the assisted personsâ€™ information. In this respect, the present study shows that it is possible to integrate FHIR implementations with complex authentication, authorization, logging and auditing mechanisms and, simultaneously, to guarantee efficiency in terms of information access by the different user-application pairs.

Introduction Smart cities can be seen as cities capable of collecting and analyzing vast quantities of data, through low-cost sensors, data-actuated devices and wireless communication networks [1]. These data are collected and analyzed to promote automate and intelligent processes (e.g. advanced data analytic), to improve the quality of the available services and to promote the emergence of new ones. Thus, it can be foreseen impacts in different sectors, such as economy, mobility, environment, education, living conditions or governance [2]. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the systematic reviews related to the implementation of smart cities are scarce and address very specific aspects (e.g. [3-5]). The study reported in the present article is part of a medium-term project that aims to systematize current evidence related to the implementation of smart cities, so that good practices can be disseminated. Particularly, a systematic review was performed to identify the most relevant applications supported in smart citiesâ€™ infrastructure with impact in public health. Public health can be defined as â€œThe science and art of promoting health, preventing disease, and prolonging life through the organized efforts of societyâ€� [6, p.352]. In this context, smart cities can contribute to the organized efforts of the society for disease prevention and health promotion. Therefore, the broad analysis of the study reported in this article is useful to inform smart citiesâ€™ stakeholders about state-of-the-art solutions with impact in public health and to inform the researchers about the gaps of the current research. 2. Methods Considering the objective of the present study (i.e. to analyze the applications supported in smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures with impact in public health), the following research questions were elaborated: â€¢ RQ1: What are the most relevant smart citiesâ€™ applications with impact in public health? â€¢ RQ2: What are the types of technologies being used? â€¢ RQ3: What is the maturity level of the applications being reported? Boolean queries were prepared to include all the articles published before December 31, 2017, which have in their titles, abstract or keywords at least one of the following expressions: â€˜Smart Cityâ€™, â€˜Smart Citiesâ€™ â€˜Smartcityâ€™, â€˜Smartcitiesâ€™, â€˜Smart-cityâ€™ or â€˜Smart-citiesâ€™. The resources considered to be searched were two general databases, Web of Science and Scopus, and one specific technological database, IEEE Xplore. The literature search was performed on January 2018. As inclusion criteria, the authors aimed to include all the articles that report evidence of explicit use in the context of smart cities of applications requiring smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures with impact in public health. Considering the exclusion criteria, the authors aimed to exclude all the articles not published in English, without abstract or without access to full text. Furthermore, the authors also aimed to exclude all the articles that report overviews, reviews, applications that do not explicitly require smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures or that were not relevant for the specific aim of this study. After the removal of duplicates and articles without abstract, the selection of the remainder articles was performed in following steps: i) first, the authors assessed all abstracts for relevance and those clearly outside the scope of the present systematic review were removed; ii) then, the abstracts of the retrieved articles were assessed to verify if they were related to living conditions, which includes health conditions, and those articles reporting studies not related to living conditions were excluded; iii) afterwards, the abstracts of the remaining articles were assessed according to the outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria; iv) finally, the authors assessed the full text of the retrieved articles and analyzed them. In all these four steps the articles were analyzed by at least two authors. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved by consensus.

[7] (i.e. terms and definitions used in the included articles were identified to create a primary list of application domains, which was afterwards refined by further analyses). 3. Results This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) [8] and Fig. 1 presents the respective flowchart. A total of 8207 articles were retrieved from the initial search on Web of Science, Scopus and Xplore (identification phase). Figure 1. PRISMA flowchart. The initial step of the screening phase (i.e. step 1 of the abstracts screening) yielded 8 130 articles by removing the duplicates (67 articles) or the articles without abstracts (10 articles). Based on abstracts (i.e. step 2 of the abstracts screening), 2 676 articles were removed due to the following reasons: i) are not published in English (11 articles); ii) are overviews or systematic revisions (391 articles); iii) are editorials, prefaces, and announcements of special issues, workshops or books (97 articles); or iv) are not related to applications for smart cities (2 177 articles). Afterwards, the abstracts of the remaining 5 454 articles were analyzed (i.e. step 3 of the abstracts screening) and it was concluded that 536 articles were related to smart living. However, of these 536 articles, 437 articles were excluded because although they are related to living conditions (e.g. environment, tourism, mobility or governance), they are not specifically related to health conditions of the individuals and 80 articles were excluded because they are related to healthcare conditions, but do not consider a public health perspective (i.e. step 4 of the abstracts screening). Finally, the full texts of remainder 19 articles were assessed and were considered eligible for the systematic review (i.e. full texts screening). From those 19 articles, 15 were published in conference proceedings and only four were published in scientific journals [9-12]. After the respective analyses, these articles were divided into healthy lifestyles promotion [11, 12, 13] Identified articles (n=8 207). Articles underwent full text review (n=19).

In terms of the promotion of healthy lifestyles, three articles were explored [11, 12, 13]. Trencher and Karvonen [11] present a real-world case study on the Japanese smart city of Kashiwanoha, which follows three main approaches: monitoring devices (e.g. wearable activity sensor, pedometer or scales) to capture continuous lifestyle data, provision of educational initiatives concentrated in walking, diet, and socializing, and enticement for behavioral change, which includes gamification based on the collected lifestyle data. The study found that citizens were well engaged in using these three approaches and were observed concrete changes in their behavior towards a healthier lifestyle. In turn, Yu et al. [12] propose an intelligent farm relaxation concept and develop the architecture of an intelligent farm management system based on internet of things technology. Finally, Fran Casino et al. [13] present a context-aware recommender system that offers personalized recommendations of exercise routes to people according to their medical condition and real-time information from a smart city. The authors performed a simulation with two datasets (i.e. Barcelona and Tarragona datasets) contained 39 routes with six thousand simulated users to evaluate the correctness of the recommendations. Trials with real users are foreseen as future work. Concerning surveillance of accidents, Shikhar et al. [14] propose a data analytic system to predict and reduce the impact of traffic accidents and uncover relevant patterns followed by accidents. The system is trained with past data using a decision tree method. The data set to test the system was received by the office of Traffic Commissioner at Bangalore and integrated information such as the type of accidents, light conditions, severity, speed zone, and alcohol consumptions. With this implementation, it was possible, among other results, to lighten hidden causes for the accidents, as well as to identify primary causes. The authors emphasize the advantages in improving the collection and analysis of additional data, namely using sensors inside the vehicles or the global positioning system (GPS). Some future applications are mentioned, such as timely report of information to police, hospitals and emergency services, implementation of protective measure to ensure road-safety of older adults and school children, and design of policies to guarantee more road-safety. Regarding the surveillance of environmental conditions, two articles were considered for analysis. While Von Son et al. [15] propose a platform that allows obtaining and analyzing genetic information of individuals and evaluating how their genetics are performing and interacting with their environment in a city, Guo et al. [16] introduce a novel approach that leverages on smartphone usersâ€™ data and utilizes the Solar Radiation Model, known as SORAM, to calculate how much sunlight a person is exposed to in urban environments. In [15] the authors propose genome-wide association studies (GWAS) among individuals and monitoring of their environment to better understand the link between genetic traits and disease. The article results from an ongoing project, which was still in the first of three phases. From the first phase, there was only a simple system to collect and analyze genetic information of citizens, but not yet a network developed and neither a way to monitor real-time interactions. The final purpose is to interconnect hospitals, research institutes and population in order to offer a solution for clinical decision support, preventive education and risk assessment for improving patientsâ€™ safety and reducing overall healthcare costs. The authors consider an approach involving a genotyping characterization of the social components and distribution, a real time monitoring technology for the study of multiple variables (e.g. infrastructure, weather or social interactions) and electronic health records as a representative mechanism to understand the possible medical requirements of particular individuals. On the other hand, Guo et al. [16] aim to develop a cheap and accurate way of continuously estimating each citizen ultraviolet radiation exposure. This research project has implemented a SORAM algorithm to calculate the sunlight exposure based on the mobile user location, pollution, building shadows and weather effects. Primarily, this is achieved by developing a smartphone application that uses advanced modelling techniques to estimate the level of ultraviolet radiation exposure each person is subjected to at any given time and location. The novelty is that the proposed solution does not require purpose-built hardware such as a photo voltaic sensor, but utilizes a combination of accurate wireless localization, and weather-terrain-informed sunlight propagation mapping. The application was evaluated in simulated and real locations for five days in the University of Warwick campus. The evaluation has demonstrated that the result Nelson Pacheco Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 516â€“523 519 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 method proposed by Ghapanchi et al. [7] (i.e. terms and definitions used in the included articles were identified to create a primary list of application domains, which was afterwards refined by further analyses). 3. Results This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) [8] and Fig. 1 presents the respective flowchart. A total of 8207 articles were retrieved from the initial search on Web of Science, Scopus and Xplore (identification phase). Figure 1. PRISMA flowchart. The initial step of the screening phase (i.e. step 1 of the abstracts screening) yielded 8 130 articles by removing the duplicates (67 articles) or the articles without abstracts (10 articles). Based on abstracts (i.e. step 2 of the abstracts screening), 2 676 articles were removed due to the following reasons: i) are not published in English (11 articles); ii) are overviews or systematic revisions (391 articles); iii) are editorials, prefaces, and announcements of special issues, workshops or books (97 articles); or iv) are not related to applications for smart cities (2 177 articles). Afterwards, the abstracts of the remaining 5 454 articles were analyzed (i.e. step 3 of the abstracts screening) and it was concluded that 536 articles were related to smart living. However, of these 536 articles, 437 articles were excluded because although they are related to living conditions (e.g. environment, tourism, mobility or governance), they are not specifically related to health conditions of the individuals and 80 articles were excluded because they are related to healthcare conditions, but do not consider a public health perspective (i.e. step 4 of the abstracts screening). Finally, the full texts of remainder 19 articles were assessed and were considered eligible for the systematic review (i.e. full texts screening). From those 19 articles, 15 were published in conference proceedings and only four were published in scientific journals [9-12]. After the respective analyses, these articles were divided into healthy lifestyles promotion [11, 12, 13] Identified articles (n=8 207). Articles underwent full text review (n=19).

SÃ¡nchez BernabÃ©u et al. [9] propose a monitoring information system to provide, in real-time or delayed, an index of electromagnetic radiation of buildings and areas of a smart city to support individuals who suffer the pathology of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. The authors developed a prototype capable of taking advantage of infrastructures and data of the smart cities, without adding new elements [9]. Within the scope of the surveillance of the health conditions of older adults, two articles were considered [17, 18], both referring to the same project, City4Age, a project partially funded by the European Union, in the context of the Horizon 2020 programme. Paolini et al. [17] describe the City4age project with its overall vision, general framework, actors, purposes, methods, technologies and modular pieces solving specific problems. In turn, Urosevic et al. [18] present an interactive environment that allows geriatricians and caregivers to access, analyze and understand a variety of heterogeneous data obtained from smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. The purpose is to identify and characterize relevant behaviour changes using multifunctional dashboard interfaces. The overall goal is to detect as early as possible negative behaviour changes in the ageing population, likely to lead to insurgence of frailty situations. The first baseline prototype is the Individual Monitoring Dashboards (IMDs) and, in the context of City4age, the IMD Environment is deployed in six different cities (Athens, Birmingham, Lecce, Madrid, Montpellier and Singapore) [18]. The dashboards have been implemented through components of responsive web application, exchanging data with the City4Age unified cloud data repository via a set of RESTful web services. The front-end components are implemented using a modular open source library. Moreover, the set of installations allows the evaluation of the flexibility of the environment, and its adaptability to various contexts. Regarding the surveillance of emotions, six articles were explored [10, 19-23]. Guthier et al. [19] provide an overview of the relevant affective states, showing how they can be detected individually and then aggregated into a global model of affect. The authors give an insight to the problem and propose directions for solution. They discuss a computational representation of affect in a city and propose potential applications that become possible in an affect-aware city. Furthermore, few examples of applications that would benefit from the availability of affective data is given. In turn, Roza and Postolache [20] present a smartphone application, which analyses the citizensâ€™ emotions and the relation between these parameters and different city areas. The emotion analysis is based on eight patterns of emotions and the results are shared between citizens through the implemented application. The techniques used to acquire data involve heart rate, heart rate variability and galvanic skin response, measured by sensors and an online questionnaire applied to citizens using a smartphone application. Data were processed by a smartphone application that includes signal acquisition control, citizensâ€™ emotions analysis, emotions mapping and data storage. Then, the citizens emotions reported to a city area were represented in different colors using Google maps application programming interface (API) on the mobile application. The application was tested in laboratory with 10 citizens (each experiment duration was seven minutes per citizen). In twenty analyzed emotions in eighteen case were found correct match. Guo et al. [21] attempted to map and correlate large-scale sentiment data to urban geography features, and consequently endeavored to understand the main sources of happiness in the city landscape. The data used from two sources: 0.4 million geo-tagged social media data purchased from Twitter, covering a two weeks period, and United Kingdom government ward-level socioeconomic and urban geographical data (open access) from the London Data Store. Natural language processing was applied in order to understand the underlying socioeconomic and urban geography parameters that influence happiness. The results show that the number of jobs and children, as well as accessibility to public transport influence happiness more significantly than environmental parameters such as degradation, education quality or crime. Zhao [22] explored various pre-processing methods in order to assess how they affect the performance of Twitter sentiment classifiers. To achieve this goal, the influence of six pre-processing methods on the accuracy of sentiment classification was evaluated using four different sentiment classifiers on five Twitter data sets. The observations indicate that removal Uniform Resource Locator (URL), removal stop word and removal numbers hardly affect the performance of the classifiers and replacing negation and expanding acronym can improve the classification accuracy. A relevant conclusion of this study is that the various pre-processing methods cause different influence on performance of classifiers for each data set in two features models. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 Another article [23] aims to present an Ambient Geographic Information (AGI) approach to assemble geo-tagged data from Twitter, Flickr, Instagram and Facebook related to citizensâ€™ perception and feelings regarding Lisbon, and characterize its emotional dimension, by comparing these subjective observations with objective measurements (e.g. socio-demographic statistics, questionnaires or data retrieved from biometric sensors). The purpose is to georeference any spatial information related to emotion, enthusiasm, memories and stress related to the citizensâ€™ perception about the urban space. As a case-study, the city of Lisbon is analyzed by using a text-mining approach in order to place in a map, any spatial tag/post related to emotion, good or bad. The emotional states of Lisbon citizens are sensed through a variety of social media sources, by extracting features and applying machine learning techniques. Finally, this data (subjective observations) can be compared with results from objective measurements. However, the only result of this research is the methodological approach, focusing on creating tools and methods that can collect, analyze and share information, based on geospatial user-generated content linked with social networks and media. O'Neill and Peoples [10] propose a web-based portal through which citizens can provide personal details (e.g. age, gender or household income) together with their feelings of well-being. Users answer a set of questions to ascertain their mood and subsequently their well-being. In addition, they can answer questions relating to their satisfaction with city services. These questions and their answers are categorized for analysis and provide city authorities with access to information on potential needs for service improvement. Data gathered by the system falls into three categories: citizen profile, citizen well-being, and city services satisfaction. This lets the city authorities analyze views about city services from specific citizen groups and they can use the system to identify services that arenâ€™t performing to a satisfactory standard. To achieve the functional requirements of the described system, a range of open source technologies were integrated to create a cross-platform, interoperable, and rapidly deployable solution composed by website front end, database back end and data visualization module. In what epidemic surveillance concerns two articles were explored [24, 25]. Patsakis et al. [24] developed a method that can be used to allow citizens to send their data without disclosing their identity, is proposed while simultaneously enabling almost real-time urban scale virologic and epidemiological data monitoring. The main research question considered in this work is how to aggregate sensitive sensor information such as medical measurements, in a scalable and private way. The main contribution of the study is the provision of an architecture that allows the ubiquitous monitoring of patients, which respects their right to privacy. This architecture is scalable, allowing the monitoring to be performed on an urban scale. In turn, Beltran-Ramirez et al. [25] present a prototype of a smartphone application that aids the recovery expectations of a patient with diseases as Influenza and Dengue, by offering a rapid diagnosis in order to prevent epidemics. Regarding fitness activities surveillance, the article examined [26] reinforces the fact that there is currently no structured approach to collect and re-use sensor fitness data and describes the distinct types of fitness sensor applications. Also, a conceptual architecture for data collection and aggregation is presented as well as the steps and developments that would improve the quality and usability of data collected. Further, the types of secondary uses for smart cities of these collected data are explored. The conceptual architecture encompasses different approaches, combining different types of applications involved in fitness data collection. The architecture described would allow for the collection of fitness data from unrelated sources to provide aggregation and analysis. The types of usage of collected data ranged from that of urban planning and transport monitoring in regard to cycling infrastructure, to more health focused data such as the surveillance of the population health conditions. In what food quality surveillance concerns [27], a low-cost cooperative monitoring tool is presented, which allows one to know, in real-time, the concentrations of gases in raw milk. The proposed prototype is an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) based monitoring unit, which is able to monitor the unwanted ingredients present in the tested milk with the help of gas sensors. This novel method is used for decision-making with threshold limit to detect the presence of volatile organic compounds, which are major reasons for off flavors of milk. The proposed model was evaluated: milk samples were collected from local farms without adding any preservatives into it, were directly exposed to the sensor array at 3 cm distance from milk surface and the responses of the sensors were collected and transmitted. The developed prototype presents utmost performance and its response is valid in real time. Experimental measurements performed in different areas of a city has proved to be both reliable and efficient.

Discussion and Conclusion Only one article [11] reports a real-world trial involving the population of a smart city. All the remained 18 articles classified as public health and analyzed in this review report applications in an early stage of development. However, it must be emphasized that all the articles report and discuss important topics and tools with significant future applications in the context of smart cities. After this revision, it is also possible to state that, in the case of public health, relevant arguments were made regarding the importance of smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. Concerning the first research question (i.e. the most relevant smart citiesâ€™ applications with impact in public health), we may conclude that there is a concern to develop smart citiesâ€™ applications to support surveillance of the populations and the environment. The types of this surveillance are diverse and include surveillance of traffic accidents [14], environmental conditions [15, 16], electromagnetic radiation [9], health conditions of older adults [17, 18], emotions [10, 19-23], epidemics [24, 25], level of fitness activity [26] and food quality [27]. Furthermore, three articles deal with the promotion of healthy lifestyles [11, 12, 13]. It should be pointed out that a significant number of articles (i.e. [10, 19-23]) deal with population emotions surveillance. The studies reported by these articles use different kind of applications (e.g. Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, smartphone apps or web-portals) to detect relevant affective states of the individuals, which can be aggregated and correlated to objective measurements (e.g. socio-demographic statistics, questionnaires, data retrieved from biometric sensors, or urban geography areas and features). These results show that the implementation of smart cities can have impact in public health (i.e. disease prevention and health promotions) and, therefore, are in line with current concerns of the developed countries [28]. With respect to the technologies being used (i.e. the second research question), the use of social networks (e.g. [21- 23]) is reported in various articles. Also, cloud computing is being used to store relevant data and different technologies, including natural languages processing [21], are being used to process these data. In terms of data acquisition, the included articles report the use of a wide range of sensors (e.g. sensors inside vehicles [14], photo voltaic sensors [16], gas sensors [27] or biometric sensors [11, 20, 21, 24, 26]). These sensors can acquire relevant environmental or individualsâ€™ data. It should be noted that in one specific study [15], environmental data is correlated to genetic information of individuals to evaluate how their genetics are performing and interacting with their environment in a city. Finally, concerning the third research question (i.e. the maturity level of the applications being reported), all the studies except one are in an early stage of development. Considering the research methods that were used, different approaches were considered: prototypes were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts [13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 27], prototypes were implemented and used to evaluate its effectiveness for a given use case [10, 18, 25], and architectures were defined [12, 24, 26]. Moreover, two articles are project descriptions [15, 17], one is a methodological approach [23], one is an assessment of existing methods [22] and another one [19] illustrates a few examples of applications that would benefit from the availability of affective data. Only one article [11] presents a real-world trial on a Japanese smart city. However, it is difficult to foresee its portability to other cities since data- driven approaches to health management risk bumping against social norms. Therefore, this systematic review of the literature shows that the articles report solutions still far from consolidated solutions and most of them do not report evidence about the evaluation of the applications in real environments neither about their evaluation in the context of smart cities. After this revision it is also possible to state that, in the case of public health, relevant arguments were made regarding the importance of smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures in order to enhance the potential of the described solutions. Moreover, in some cases, the authors tried to redefine the role of smart applications with impact in the public health in the cities of the future. Nevertheless, it is evident the lack of robust evaluation trials, since most of the solutions being reported are proof of concepts prototypes. It is also evident that the implementation of smart cities is still in an early stage and is still not largely imbued within public health domain. Although the authors tried, in methodological terms, to guarantee that the review selection and the data extraction were rigorous, it should be acknowledged that this study has limitations, namely the dependency on the keywords and the selected databases and the fact that both grey literature and publications written in other languages than English were excluded. 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 References 1.

Discussion and Conclusion Only one article [11] reports a real-world trial involving the population of a smart city. All the remained 18 articles classified as public health and analyzed in this review report applications in an early stage of development. However, it must be emphasized that all the articles report and discuss important topics and tools with significant future applications in the context of smart cities. After this revision, it is also possible to state that, in the case of public health, relevant arguments were made regarding the importance of smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures. Concerning the first research question (i.e. the most relevant smart citiesâ€™ applications with impact in public health), we may conclude that there is a concern to develop smart citiesâ€™ applications to support surveillance of the populations and the environment. The types of this surveillance are diverse and include surveillance of traffic accidents [14], environmental conditions [15, 16], electromagnetic radiation [9], health conditions of older adults [17, 18], emotions [10, 19-23], epidemics [24, 25], level of fitness activity [26] and food quality [27]. Furthermore, three articles deal with the promotion of healthy lifestyles [11, 12, 13]. It should be pointed out that a significant number of articles (i.e. [10, 19-23]) deal with population emotions surveillance. The studies reported by these articles use different kind of applications (e.g. Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, smartphone apps or web-portals) to detect relevant affective states of the individuals, which can be aggregated and correlated to objective measurements (e.g. socio-demographic statistics, questionnaires, data retrieved from biometric sensors, or urban geography areas and features). These results show that the implementation of smart cities can have impact in public health (i.e. disease prevention and health promotions) and, therefore, are in line with current concerns of the developed countries [28]. With respect to the technologies being used (i.e. the second research question), the use of social networks (e.g. [21- 23]) is reported in various articles. Also, cloud computing is being used to store relevant data and different technologies, including natural languages processing [21], are being used to process these data. In terms of data acquisition, the included articles report the use of a wide range of sensors (e.g. sensors inside vehicles [14], photo voltaic sensors [16], gas sensors [27] or biometric sensors [11, 20, 21, 24, 26]). These sensors can acquire relevant environmental or individualsâ€™ data. It should be noted that in one specific study [15], environmental data is correlated to genetic information of individuals to evaluate how their genetics are performing and interacting with their environment in a city. Finally, concerning the third research question (i.e. the maturity level of the applications being reported), all the studies except one are in an early stage of development. Considering the research methods that were used, different approaches were considered: prototypes were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts [13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 27], prototypes were implemented and used to evaluate its effectiveness for a given use case [10, 18, 25], and architectures were defined [12, 24, 26]. Moreover, two articles are project descriptions [15, 17], one is a methodological approach [23], one is an assessment of existing methods [22] and another one [19] illustrates a few examples of applications that would benefit from the availability of affective data. Only one article [11] presents a real-world trial on a Japanese smart city. However, it is difficult to foresee its portability to other cities since data- driven approaches to health management risk bumping against social norms. Therefore, this systematic review of the literature shows that the articles report solutions still far from consolidated solutions and most of them do not report evidence about the evaluation of the applications in real environments neither about their evaluation in the context of smart cities. After this revision it is also possible to state that, in the case of public health, relevant arguments were made regarding the importance of smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures in order to enhance the potential of the described solutions. Moreover, in some cases, the authors tried to redefine the role of smart applications with impact in the public health in the cities of the future. Nevertheless, it is evident the lack of robust evaluation trials, since most of the solutions being reported are proof of concepts prototypes. It is also evident that the implementation of smart cities is still in an early stage and is still not largely imbued within public health domain. Although the authors tried, in methodological terms, to guarantee that the review selection and the data extraction were rigorous, it should be acknowledged that this study has limitations, namely the dependency on the keywords and the selected databases and the fact that both grey literature and publications written in other languages than English were excluded. 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 References 1.

The work developed had the objective of analysing the existence of nonconformities related to the consistency of the Radiology Information Systems (RIS) and Picture and Communication System (PACS) databases, as well as their precision, accuracy, integrity and associated risks for the healthcare practice. Data belonging to 1068 computed radiography studies were analysed and ten nonconformities were identified, related to the patient name, patient age, patient date of birth, patient gender, study date, study time, institution identification, radiologist identification, number of radiographic projections performed, and billing code. The work carried out allowed identifying some lack of data quality, sometimes evidenced in the absence of consistency, precision, accuracy and integrity.",

Introduction The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and their use in clinical contexts made it possible to acquire and integrate patientsâ€™ data resulting from multiple episodes/procedures. These data are acquired and managed by different information systems, namely electronic health records [1], with different functional, technological and architectural perspectives [2]. The use of ICT promotes improved healthcare delivery. This is particularly evident in developing countries where the implementation of clinical information systems improves communication between institutions, helps the organization and management of medicines, and allows monitoring and detecting patients who can abandon treatment, among other contributions [3]. For several decades now, the growing complexity and scope of ICT in clinical settings has been evident in different areas of healthcare provision, namely in the area of medical imaging, allowing the aggregation and availability of data to different stakeholders, which might be internal or external to the organizations [4]. Regarding medical imaging professionals, they access in a daily basis to multiple information systems, such as Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Radiology Information Systems (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). The networking of these systems promotes the collection, analysis, dissemination and archiving of patientâ€™s clinical information and also information related to the actors involved in the provision of healthcare over the time [5]. Concerning the requests for examinations managed by RIS, a critical process for carrying out medical imaging studies [6] that requires data to be shared with PACS databases, some authors have identified lack of data quality [7][8] which may undermine the provision of healthcare [9]. The healthcare provision as well as the professional and department performance characterization are supported by these data, which makes their quality a critical aspect to consider. Therefore, the exploratory study being reported aimed to find out nonconformities related to the consistency of RIS and PACS databases, in terms of their integrity, precision and accuracy, as well as their risks for the clinical practice. 2. Background The development, adoption, and implementation of new technological resources in a clinical context can promote better access to health data, with the potential to reduce attendance errors, increase collaboration between clinicians and improve communication between clinicians and patients, if adequate strategies are implemented to allow the exchange of correct and timely clinical data among the different stakeholders [3][11]. Usually, in a clinical context, the installed information systems were developed and are supported by different manufacturers and software vendors [12]. Consequently, the exchange of data often results in fragmented or even duplicate versions and, frequently, health institutions have the same data stored under different formats in different systems. This means that extra complexity is required to maintain consistency between different databases [13]. The quality of the clinical data has been object of study over the years, mainly due to the need to characterize the procedures supported by these data. For instance, Botsis et al. [10] found inconsistency, inaccuracy and lack of data in electronic health records databases. Moreover, Cruz Correia et al. [14] identified that 94.2% of all HL7 message traffic generated by healthcare institution presented nonconformities that jeopardized their quality, being the concept of quality considered as \"suitability for use\" (i.e. in accordance with the objectives of the messagesâ€™ use). According to Muller and Freytag, [17] nonconformities detected in clinical data can be semantic (e.g. integrity constraint violations or contradictions), syntactical (e.g. lexical errors, domain format errors or irregularities), and coverage (e.g. missing values or tuples anomalies) nonconformities. Botsis et al. [10] found that data inconsistencies result from two reasons: i) fragmentation caused by care records performed at different healthcare facilities; and ii) lack of contextual information caused by poor medical documentation. Since the quality of the data may be dependent on several factors, it can be analysed according to different dimensions. In particular, the data should be relevant, timely, accurate, complete, sufficiently detailed and consistent (i.e. appropriately represented), and should retain contextual information [15][16].

Since the quality of the data may be dependent on several factors, it can be analysed according to different dimensions. In particular, the data should be relevant, timely, accurate, complete, sufficiently detailed and consistent (i.e. appropriately represented), and should retain contextual information [15][16]. Therefore, some studies 510 Joana Almeida et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 508â€“515 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 were focused on the analysis of data quality in different dimensions in order to perform evaluations and comparisons, so that a set of guidelines were developed and proposed to consistently report and compare the results related to clinical data quality [10][18][19]. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that data are consistent independently of being stored in multiple databases [20]. According to Mphatswe et al. [21], clinicians lifelong training and periodic data reviews and audits are processes that can promote the improvement of data quality. In the scope of medical imaging, data nonconformities are related to incorrect patientsâ€™ data records or studiesâ€™ requests, which makes evident the importance of tools to allow the reconciliation of patientsâ€™ data [22]. On the other hand, the existence of errors or non-compliance in the data registered in RIS and PACS databases often implies to process images and to correct the records in order to guarantee the right record of the patients and respective episodes [23]. In this context, Nissen-Meyer et al. [20] developed a tool to verify the correctness of a set of identification criteria associated with essential HIS, RIS and PACS data. The authors found discrepancies in the consistency of information ranging from 0.14% to 8.00%. Moreover, considering the data stored in PACS archives, Santos et al. [24] identified the existence of factors that could compromise their quality, namely the existence of fields related to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata that were not filled or were incorrectly filled in. This lack of quality of the DICOM metadata, although residual, may be present in medical imaging studies aiming to characterize the exposure of a population to radiation [25] or medical imaging stakeholders, by using medical image repositories [26]. In the specific case of data reconciliation of RIS and PACS databases, Nitrosi et al. [27] highlighted four types of errors, each one with a respective degree of severity: i) incorrect fusion of different data regarding the same patient (moderate risk); ii) incorrect linking of an image or study to an episode or patient (high risk); iii) incorrect assignment of images or study to an event of the same patient (high risk); and iv) incorrect identification of projection/laterality (high risk). 3. Material and Methods The data on computed radiography studies (i.e. â€œChest - two projectionsâ€�, â€œAbdomen - one projectionâ€� and â€œBilateral - two projectionsâ€�) performed for one month in a medium-sized hospital were analysed. The choice of these type of studies was based on the fact that they are among the most performed at National [28] and European levels [29]. The research study was authorized by the administration board and the ethics committee of the involved hospital, being assured that the data collected would be treated in a way that would maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the patients as well as of all those that performed and analysed the imaging studies. Moreover, the experimental work was developed in three phases. During phase one the RIS and PACS databases were analysed in order to collect information about existing fields and respective filling levels related to patients and requested studies. In turn, during phase two the collected information was structured to allow a comparative analysis of RIS and PACS databases fields (i.e. an intra-field and inter-field analysis). Finally, during phase three it was identified and characterized the existing nonconformities between RIS and PACS database data. The considered nonconformities were: i) consistency (i.e. comparative analysis of data representation); ii) precision (i.e. degree of correctness with which real-world data are represented); iii) accuracy (i.e. the extent to which data is recorded and updated); iv) integrity (i.e. the degree to which all relevant data are recorded and available); and associated risks to the patients (i.e. high, medium or low risk). 4. Results 4.1. The Study Sample The analysis of the RIS and PACS databases allowed the collection of data related to 1068 imaging studies (Table 1), being 430 studies of the â€œChest - two projectionsâ€� (40.3%), 599 studies of the â€œAbdomen - one projectionâ€� (56.1%), and 39 studies of the â€œBilateral Hips - two projectionsâ€� (3,7%). 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 Table 1 - Sample of computed radiography studies Study N(%) â€œChest - two projectionsâ€� 430 (40.3%) â€œAbdomen - one projectionâ€� 599 (56.1%) â€œBilateral Hips - two projectionsâ€� 39 (3.7%) Total of studies 1068 (100.0%) From the comparative analysis of the intra-field data (i.e. fields present in both information systems, RIS and PACS) and inter-field (i.e. fields that, although not having the same definition in both information systems are directly related) resulted the Table 2.

On the other hand, there are eight PACS database fields that were not filled. Moreover, it is also possible to identify fields that, although with different designations in the RIS and PACS information systems, store equivalent information (e.g. the RIS Study Description field and the PACS Number of study images field), or even fields that store the same information within a same database such as, for example, the Study Description field and the Billing Code, both fields present in the RIS database. 4.2. Nonconformities between RIS/PACS Databases When analysing the data present in the different fields of the RIS and PACS databases it was identified Joana Almeida et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 508â€“515 511 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 3 were focused on the analysis of data quality in different dimensions in order to perform evaluations and comparisons, so that a set of guidelines were developed and proposed to consistently report and compare the results related to clinical data quality [10][18][19]. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that data are consistent independently of being stored in multiple databases [20]. According to Mphatswe et al. [21], clinicians lifelong training and periodic data reviews and audits are processes that can promote the improvement of data quality. In the scope of medical imaging, data nonconformities are related to incorrect patientsâ€™ data records or studiesâ€™ requests, which makes evident the importance of tools to allow the reconciliation of patientsâ€™ data [22]. On the other hand, the existence of errors or non-compliance in the data registered in RIS and PACS databases often implies to process images and to correct the records in order to guarantee the right record of the patients and respective episodes [23]. In this context, Nissen-Meyer et al. [20] developed a tool to verify the correctness of a set of identification criteria associated with essential HIS, RIS and PACS data. The authors found discrepancies in the consistency of information ranging from 0.14% to 8.00%. Moreover, considering the data stored in PACS archives, Santos et al. [24] identified the existence of factors that could compromise their quality, namely the existence of fields related to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata that were not filled or were incorrectly filled in. This lack of quality of the DICOM metadata, although residual, may be present in medical imaging studies aiming to characterize the exposure of a population to radiation [25] or medical imaging stakeholders, by using medical image repositories [26]. In the specific case of data reconciliation of RIS and PACS databases, Nitrosi et al. [27] highlighted four types of errors, each one with a respective degree of severity: i) incorrect fusion of different data regarding the same patient (moderate risk); ii) incorrect linking of an image or study to an episode or patient (high risk); iii) incorrect assignment of images or study to an event of the same patient (high risk); and iv) incorrect identification of projection/laterality (high risk). 3. Material and Methods The data on computed radiography studies (i.e. â€œChest - two projectionsâ€�, â€œAbdomen - one projectionâ€� and â€œBilateral - two projectionsâ€�) performed for one month in a medium-sized hospital were analysed. The choice of these type of studies was based on the fact that they are among the most performed at National [28] and European levels [29]. The research study was authorized by the administration board and the ethics committee of the involved hospital, being assured that the data collected would be treated in a way that would maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the patients as well as of all those that performed and analysed the imaging studies. Moreover, the experimental work was developed in three phases. During phase one the RIS and PACS databases were analysed in order to collect information about existing fields and respective filling levels related to patients and requested studies. In turn, during phase two the collected information was structured to allow a comparative analysis of RIS and PACS databases fields (i.e. an intra-field and inter-field analysis). Finally, during phase three it was identified and characterized the existing nonconformities between RIS and PACS database data. The considered nonconformities were: i) consistency (i.e. comparative analysis of data representation); ii) precision (i.e. degree of correctness with which real-world data are represented); iii) accuracy (i.e. the extent to which data is recorded and updated); iv) integrity (i.e. the degree to which all relevant data are recorded and available); and associated risks to the patients (i.e. high, medium or low risk). 4. Results 4.1. The Study Sample The analysis of the RIS and PACS databases allowed the collection of data related to 1068 imaging studies (Table 1), being 430 studies of the â€œChest - two projectionsâ€� (40.3%), 599 studies of the â€œAbdomen - one projectionâ€� (56.1%), and 39 studies of the â€œBilateral Hips - two projectionsâ€� (3,7%). 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 Table 1 - Sample of computed radiography studies Study N(%) â€œChest - two projectionsâ€� 430 (40.3%) â€œAbdomen - one projectionâ€� 599 (56.1%) â€œBilateral Hips - two projectionsâ€� 39 (3.7%) Total of studies 1068 (100.0%) From the comparative analysis of the intra-field data (i.e. fields present in both information systems, RIS and PACS) and inter-field (i.e. fields that, although not having the same definition in both information systems are directly related) resulted the Table 2.

On the other hand, there are eight PACS database fields that were not filled. Moreover, it is also possible to identify fields that, although with different designations in the RIS and PACS information systems, store equivalent information (e.g. the RIS Study Description field and the PACS Number of study images field), or even fields that store the same information within a same database such as, for example, the Study Description field and the Billing Code, both fields present in the RIS database. 4.2. Nonconformities between RIS/PACS Databases When analysing the data present in the different fields of the RIS and PACS databases it was identified 512 Joana Almeida et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 508â€“515 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 nonconformities related to: i) patient name (NC1); ii) patient age (NC2); iii) patient date of birth (NC3); iv) patient gender (NC4); v) study date (NC5); vi) study time (NC6); vii) institution identification (NC7); viii) radiologist (NC8); ix) number of radiographic projections performed (NC9); and x) billing code/study performed (NC10). Table 3 shows the NCs that present the data quality dimensions that were analysed. Furthermore, the last column of the same table presents the respective degree of risk. Table 3 - Characterization of the nonconformities present in the RIS and PACS databases Nonconfor mity ID Description RIS/PACS Consistency (equal format/representation) Other data quality dimension affected Risk NC1 Patient name (RIS â‰ PACS) Present Precision, Accuracy High NC2 Patient age (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision, Accuracy Low NC3 Patient date of birth (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision Medium NC4 Patient gender (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision Low NC5 Study date (RIS â‰ PACS), Absent Precision, Accuracy High NC6 Study time (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision, Accuracy Low NC7 Institution identification (RIS â‰ PACS) Present Precision, Accuracy Medium NC8 Radiologist identification (RIS) Present Precision, Integrity Medium NC9 Number of radiographic projections performed (RIS â‰ PACS) Present Precision, Accuracy Medium NC10 Billing code / study performed (RIS â‰ PACS). Present Precision, Accuracy Medium Analysing Table 3 it is possible to conclude that five of the ten NC identified are related to consistency deficits between the data stored in the two databases (consistency absent). Of these five nonconformities, three also present precision and accuracy deficits (two nonconformities classified with low risk and one with high risk), and one only present deficits of precision (classified with a medium risk). Regarding the nonconformities that present consistency among the data, but present other data quality dimension deficits, they represent 40.0% of the nonconformities (four out of ten). Moreover, four nonconformities have precision and accuracy deficits (three were classified as medium risk and one with high risk) and one has only a precision deficit (classified as medium risk). Table 4 - Nonconformities identified in the 1068 studies analyzed.

Regarding NC2, this nonconformity appears in 58.6% of the abdomen studies and 51.3% of the bilateral hip studies. In contrast, NC1, NC3, NC4, NC5 and NC7 present low values, some of them almost residual, or even null (e.g. NC1 and NC3 in the abdomen and bilateral hip studies). 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5. Discussion 5.1. Accuracy, Precision and Integrity Deficits Nonconformities were identified in which, although there is consistency between the data from RIS and PACS databases, deficits related to the precision, accuracy and integrity dimensions were present (Table 4). The patient name data field is always populated in both databases. However, it was possible to identify situations in which for the same study and patient, the patient name was not the same in both databases (NC1). For example, in several situations the complete name of the patient was stored in the PACS database, while in the RIS database the name was incomplete, and vice-versa. This nonconformity was detected in about 0.5% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and 1.2% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. One possible explanation might be that manual insertion of patientsâ€™ data occurred when the information system was not accessible such, as, for example, in cases of urgency or lack of connection between information systems. This nonconformity can be considered as high risk, since the physician when using the patient name to query the information system, which is a very common practice, might select the wrong patient. Regarding the institution identification nonconformity (NC7), accuracy and precision deficits were identified (e.g. empty fields or fields with different contents appearing in the RIS database when compared to the PACS database) in 6.5% of the chest studies, and in residual percentages for the other studies. The same happens with nonconformities related to the identification of the radiologist who executes or validates the study (NC8). A high percentage of this type of nonconformities is present in the Abdomen studies (97.0%). Although the respective field exist in the PACS database, it was not populated, which means that it was not possible to compare the information stored in the databases of the two information systems. Similar situations were also identified in other studies when analysing medical image repositories [24]. When comparing the Radiologist field with the Operator field (both belonging to the RIS database), sometimes it was present the identification of the technician performing the procedure. The nonconformity of the both fields are considered to have medium risk since they do not endanger the health condition of the patients. However, in situations that is necessary to contact the technicians responsible for performing the studies, important information may be incorrect. Regarding the number of projections made and stored in the PACS archives (NC9), the analysis fell into two distinct but directly linked fields. The Number of study images field belonging to the PACS database was compared with the Description of the study field belonging to the RIS database. In 51.0% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies, a difference was notice between the number of stored images and the two projections that should be a part of the study. This percentage is higher (56.4%) in the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" studies. This can result from an incorrect request or change of procedures because of the characteristics of the patients. This nonconformity was considered to be of medium risk, however, it may eventually have repercussions when analysing the productivity of the medical imaging department, since this analysis is usually based on the data present in the RIS database and not on the data of the PACS database, irrespective of being the latter one the information system that effectively reports the procedures that were performed. Concerning NC10, related to the coding of the procedures for later billing (Billing code field of the RIS database), once more it was not identified data consistency problems. However, it was identified deficits of accuracy and precision when compared to the field Number of study images of the PACS database. For example, in one situation, although a \"Chest - two projections\" study should have two images, the corresponding Billing code correspond to a study \"Chest PA\", which has only one projection. This type of nonconformity was detected in about 80.0% of the \"Chest two projections\" studies, in 94.9% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" studies and in 82.8% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. This type of nonconformity can be considered to have a medium risk because it has no severe consequences for the patients. 5.2. Data Inconsistency and its Accuracy and Precision One of the nonconformities identified is relative to the age of the patient (NC2). The field destined to register the age of the patients was always filled in both RIS and PACS databases. However, it was possible to identify syntactical errors, namely lexical and domain [17]. For example, for a specific patient, the RIS database contained the value \"20 Years\", while the PACS database contained the value \"19Y\". In another situation the value \"009M\" was identified in Joana Almeida et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 508â€“515 513 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5 nonconformities related to: i) patient name (NC1); ii) patient age (NC2); iii) patient date of birth (NC3); iv) patient gender (NC4); v) study date (NC5); vi) study time (NC6); vii) institution identification (NC7); viii) radiologist (NC8); ix) number of radiographic projections performed (NC9); and x) billing code/study performed (NC10). Table 3 shows the NCs that present the data quality dimensions that were analysed. Furthermore, the last column of the same table presents the respective degree of risk. Table 3 - Characterization of the nonconformities present in the RIS and PACS databases Nonconfor mity ID Description RIS/PACS Consistency (equal format/representation) Other data quality dimension affected Risk NC1 Patient name (RIS â‰ PACS) Present Precision, Accuracy High NC2 Patient age (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision, Accuracy Low NC3 Patient date of birth (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision Medium NC4 Patient gender (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision Low NC5 Study date (RIS â‰ PACS), Absent Precision, Accuracy High NC6 Study time (RIS â‰ PACS) Absent Precision, Accuracy Low NC7 Institution identification (RIS â‰ PACS) Present Precision, Accuracy Medium NC8 Radiologist identification (RIS) Present Precision, Integrity Medium NC9 Number of radiographic projections performed (RIS â‰ PACS) Present Precision, Accuracy Medium NC10 Billing code / study performed (RIS â‰ PACS). Present Precision, Accuracy Medium Analysing Table 3 it is possible to conclude that five of the ten NC identified are related to consistency deficits between the data stored in the two databases (consistency absent). Of these five nonconformities, three also present precision and accuracy deficits (two nonconformities classified with low risk and one with high risk), and one only present deficits of precision (classified with a medium risk). Regarding the nonconformities that present consistency among the data, but present other data quality dimension deficits, they represent 40.0% of the nonconformities (four out of ten). Moreover, four nonconformities have precision and accuracy deficits (three were classified as medium risk and one with high risk) and one has only a precision deficit (classified as medium risk).

Regarding NC2, this nonconformity appears in 58.6% of the abdomen studies and 51.3% of the bilateral hip studies. In contrast, NC1, NC3, NC4, NC5 and NC7 present low values, some of them almost residual, or even null (e.g. NC1 and NC3 in the abdomen and bilateral hip studies). 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 5. Discussion 5.1. Accuracy, Precision and Integrity Deficits Nonconformities were identified in which, although there is consistency between the data from RIS and PACS databases, deficits related to the precision, accuracy and integrity dimensions were present (Table 4). The patient name data field is always populated in both databases. However, it was possible to identify situations in which for the same study and patient, the patient name was not the same in both databases (NC1).

Concerning NC10, related to the coding of the procedures for later billing (Billing code field of the RIS database), once more it was not identified data consistency problems. However, it was identified deficits of accuracy and precision when compared to the field Number of study images of the PACS database. For example, in one situation, although a \"Chest - two projections\" study should have two images, the corresponding Billing code correspond to a study \"Chest PA\", which has only one projection. This type of nonconformity was detected in about 80.0% of the \"Chest two projections\" studies, in 94.9% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" studies and in 82.8% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. This type of nonconformity can be considered to have a medium risk because it has no severe consequences for the patients. 5.2. Data Inconsistency and its Accuracy and Precision One of the nonconformities identified is relative to the age of the patient (NC2). The field destined to register the age of the patients was always filled in both RIS and PACS databases. However, it was possible to identify syntactical errors, namely lexical and domain [17]. For example, for a specific patient, the RIS database contained the value \"20 Years\", while the PACS database contained the value \"19Y\". In another situation the value \"009M\" was identified in 514 Joana Almeida et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 508â€“515 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 the PACS database while the value \"1 year\" was present in the RIS database. This type of nonconformities (NC2) was detected in 20.0% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and 51.3% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projection\" studies. NC2 was also identified in 58.6% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\". Whenever NC2 was detected precision and accuracy deficits were also identified, but the age variations were always lower than one year. In the scope of nonconformity related to the patient date of birth (NC3), different values were identified in the RIS and PACS databases for the same patient. For example, for a specific patient, it was found the value \"05-12-1954\" in the RIS database, while the value \"12-05-1954\" was found in the PACS database. This nonconformity is related to domain format errors and it was considered to have a medium risk because although it does not endanger the patientsâ€™ health conditions but may raise doubts when analysing a study if it is really related to the specific patient being subject of care. Regarding the nonconformity related to patient gender (NC4), it was possible to detect situations in which the gender of a given patient stored in the PACS is \"O\" (Other), while it is stored in the RIS as \"Feminine\". The same was observed for male patients. NC4 was detected in about 1.4% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and 3.2% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies and, additionally, accuracy deficits were also identified. This nonconformity was classified as being of low risk because it does not endanger patientsâ€™ health condition. The data fields related to the date of execution of the study are present in both the RIS and PACS databases and were always filled. In terms of nonconformities (NC5), it was possible to identify studies that have different execution date on the RIS and PACS databases (e.g. 10/11/2015 on the RIS database and 03-11-2015 on the PACS database). NC5 was detected in 4.7% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and in 1.8% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. This type of situation can have different causes, such as, it was not possible to create the electronic request in the RIS, although the request exist in RIS, it did not go automatically to the image modality, or it was not possible to register the requisition in RIS when the study was performed. Regarding other dimensions of the quality of the affected data, deficits of precision and accuracy were identified. The data fields related to the execution time of the study (NC6) are present in the RIS and PACS database and were always filled with information. From the analysis being performed it was possible to identify situations in which the information provided is not the same for the same study and patient. For instance, for a study, in the RIS database the execution time was \"12:00\" while in the PACS database it was stored \"11:45:12\". NC6 was detected in about 97.2% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies, 97.4% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" and 99.3% of \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. This type of nonconformities present deficits of precision and accuracy and it was considered to have a low risk, since in most situations it does not endanger the patientsâ€™ health conditions. Nonconformities were identified in the fields Location/Institution (NC7). NC7 was detected in 6.5% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies, in 5.1% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" studies and in 0.2% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. The data field related to the institution identification where the study was performed, although it exists in both RIS and PACS databases, was not always completed in RIS. On the other hand, the identification of the institution is sometimes different in both databases, which can be erroneous interpreted as being in presence of two distinct institutions. Although it was evident the presence of precision and accuracy deficits, NC7 represents a medium risk because it does not have significant consequences for both patients and the normal functioning of the medical imaging department. 6. Conclusion The quality of the stored data in RIS and PACS databases can be analysed to promote continuous quality improvements. The results of the experimental study reported in the present article allowed the identification of nonconformities and deficits of consistency, accuracy, precision and integrity of data stored in RIS and PACS databases. The correction of the identified problems may represent a point of improvement for the care delivery, both in terms of patients and professionals. Nevertheless, the experimental study presented some limitations. Particularly, the sample was a small convenience sample and the collection of the data was confined to a short period of time. Therefore, it is not possible the generalization of the results, as well as to draw conclusions about the totality of the data stored in the databases under analysis. 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 As a future work it will be relevant the development of tools that automatically, and with little human intervention, might analyze the quality of the data stored on RIS and PACS databases. The rapid recognition of inappropriately recorded data would allow the implementation of corrective plans and, therefore, the improvement of medical imaging care. References [1] S.

Joana Almeida et al. / Procedia Computer Science 164 (2019) 508â€“515 515 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 7 the PACS database while the value \"1 year\" was present in the RIS database. This type of nonconformities (NC2) was detected in 20.0% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and 51.3% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projection\" studies. NC2 was also identified in 58.6% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\". Whenever NC2 was detected precision and accuracy deficits were also identified, but the age variations were always lower than one year. In the scope of nonconformity related to the patient date of birth (NC3), different values were identified in the RIS and PACS databases for the same patient. For example, for a specific patient, it was found the value \"05-12-1954\" in the RIS database, while the value \"12-05-1954\" was found in the PACS database. This nonconformity is related to domain format errors and it was considered to have a medium risk because although it does not endanger the patientsâ€™ health conditions but may raise doubts when analysing a study if it is really related to the specific patient being subject of care. Regarding the nonconformity related to patient gender (NC4), it was possible to detect situations in which the gender of a given patient stored in the PACS is \"O\" (Other), while it is stored in the RIS as \"Feminine\". The same was observed for male patients. NC4 was detected in about 1.4% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and 3.2% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies and, additionally, accuracy deficits were also identified. This nonconformity was classified as being of low risk because it does not endanger patientsâ€™ health condition. The data fields related to the date of execution of the study are present in both the RIS and PACS databases and were always filled. In terms of nonconformities (NC5), it was possible to identify studies that have different execution date on the RIS and PACS databases (e.g. 10/11/2015 on the RIS database and 03-11-2015 on the PACS database). NC5 was detected in 4.7% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies and in 1.8% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. This type of situation can have different causes, such as, it was not possible to create the electronic request in the RIS, although the request exist in RIS, it did not go automatically to the image modality, or it was not possible to register the requisition in RIS when the study was performed. Regarding other dimensions of the quality of the affected data, deficits of precision and accuracy were identified. The data fields related to the execution time of the study (NC6) are present in the RIS and PACS database and were always filled with information. From the analysis being performed it was possible to identify situations in which the information provided is not the same for the same study and patient. For instance, for a study, in the RIS database the execution time was \"12:00\" while in the PACS database it was stored \"11:45:12\". NC6 was detected in about 97.2% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies, 97.4% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" and 99.3% of \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. This type of nonconformities present deficits of precision and accuracy and it was considered to have a low risk, since in most situations it does not endanger the patientsâ€™ health conditions. Nonconformities were identified in the fields Location/Institution (NC7). NC7 was detected in 6.5% of the \"Chest - two projections\" studies, in 5.1% of the \"Bilateral Hips - two projections\" studies and in 0.2% of the \"Abdomen - one projection\" studies. The data field related to the institution identification where the study was performed, although it exists in both RIS and PACS databases, was not always completed in RIS. On the other hand, the identification of the institution is sometimes different in both databases, which can be erroneous interpreted as being in presence of two distinct institutions. Although it was evident the presence of precision and accuracy deficits, NC7 represents a medium risk because it does not have significant consequences for both patients and the normal functioning of the medical imaging department. 6. Conclusion The quality of the stored data in RIS and PACS databases can be analysed to promote continuous quality improvements. The results of the experimental study reported in the present article allowed the identification of nonconformities and deficits of consistency, accuracy, precision and integrity of data stored in RIS and PACS databases. The correction of the identified problems may represent a point of improvement for the care delivery, both in terms of patients and professionals. Nevertheless, the experimental study presented some limitations. Particularly, the sample was a small convenience sample and the collection of the data was confined to a short period of time. Therefore, it is not possible the generalization of the results, as well as to draw conclusions about the totality of the data stored in the databases under analysis. 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000 As a future work it will be relevant the development of tools that automatically, and with little human intervention, might analyze the quality of the data stored on RIS and PACS databases. The rapid recognition of inappropriately recorded data would allow the implementation of corrective plans and, therefore, the improvement of medical imaging care. References [1] S.

The professional and department performance, as well as the respective characterization, are supported by these data, which makes their quality a critical aspect to take into account. The work developed had the objective of analysing the existence of nonconformities related to the consistency of the Radiology Information Systems (RIS) and Picture and Communication System (PACS) databases, as well as their precision, accuracy, integrity and associated risks for the healthcare practice. Data belonging to 1068 computed radiography studies were analysed and ten nonconformities were identified, related to the patient name, patient age, patient date of birth, patient gender, study date, study time, institution identification, radiologist identification, number of radiographic projections performed, and billing code. The work carried out allowed identifying some lack of data quality, sometimes evidenced in the absence of consistency, precision, accuracy and integrity.

Introduction During the ageing process, a significant number of role transitions occur, and these transitions vary from individual to individual [1,2]. As a consequence, there are impacts on the psychological well-being of the older adults and, therefore, it is important for them to find and foster new parallel roles, functioning at the same level as the previous, in order to maintain the quality, frequency and purpose of interactions with others. In this context, the active ageing concept has an increasing importance [3,4]. Active aging aims the maintenance of patterns of activities and values typical of middle age and can be understand as a process of optimizing opportunities for social participation, health conditions, and the safety of the individuals, in order to promote their quality of life as they age [5,6]. Therefore, it must consider not only the characteristics of the older adults, but also environmental factors that can act as barriers or facilitators [7]. In this regard, well-designed technological solutions can act as facilitators. Many researchers aimed to develop new services based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to provide support for active ageing. For instance, numerous Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications have been built to enable older adults to achieve their full potential in terms of physical, social, and mental well-being [8]. Therefore, it is important to systematize current evidence related to the impact of new technological applications and related services in terms of active ageing. Concretely, the systematic review reported in this article aimed to identify relevant applications supported in smart cities infrastructure that can promote the participation and inclusion of older adults in the community as full rights citizens. This is useful to inform smart citiesâ€™ stakeholders about state-of-the-art solutions with impact in active ageing and to identify gaps of the current research. 2. Methods For the specific objective of the systematic review reported by this article the following research questions were formulated: ï‚· RQ1 - What are the relevant smart city applications to promote active ageing? ï‚· RQ2 - What are the types of technologies being used? ï‚· RQ3 - What are the maturity levels of the applications being reported? Boolean queries were prepared to include all the articles published before December 31, 2017 that have in their titles, abstracts or keywords at least one of the following expressions: â€˜Smart Cityâ€™, â€˜Smart Citiesâ€™ â€˜Smartcityâ€™, â€˜Smartcitiesâ€™, â€˜Smart-cityâ€� or â€˜Smart-citiesâ€™. The resources considered to be searched were two general databases, Web of Science and Scopus, and one specific technological database, IEEE Xplore. The literature search was performed on January 2018. As inclusion criteria, the authors aimed to include all the articles that report evidence of explicit use of applications requiring smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures to promote active ageing. Considering the exclusion criteria, the authors aimed to exclude all the articles not published in English, without abstract or without access to full text. Furthermore, the authors also aimed to exclude all the articles that report overviews, reviews and applications that do not explicitly require smart citiesâ€™ infrastructures, or that were not relevant for the specific aim of this study. After the removal of duplicates and articles without abstract, the analysis of the remainder articles was performed according the following steps: ï‚· First, the authors assessed all abstracts for relevance and those clearly outside the scope of the present systematic review were removed. ï‚· Then, the abstracts of the retrieved articles were assessed to verify if they were related to smart living, which includes health conditions. Those articles reporting studies not related to smart living were excluded. ï‚· Afterwards, the abstracts of the remaining articles were assessed according to the outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The classification was performed by using a synthesis process based on the method proposed by Ghapanchi and Aurum [9] (i.e., terms and definitions used in the included articles were identified to create a primary list of application domains, which was afterwards refined by further analyses). In all these four steps the articles were analyzed by at least two authors. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved by consensus. Considering the included articles, for every article, the following information was registered in a data sheet prepared by the authors: (i) article authors, title and year of publication; (ii) aim of the study; (iii) details of the applications being reported; (iv) details of the applied research methods; (v) methods applied for the evaluation of the applications; (vi) results; and (vii) authorsâ€™ interpretations. 3. Results This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [10] and Fig. 1 presents the respective flowchart. Fig. 1. PRISMA Flowchart. A total of 8207 articles were retrieved from the initial search on Web of Science, Scopus and IEEE Xplore (identification phase). The initial step of the screening phase (i.e., step 1 of the abstracts screening) yielded 8130 articles by removing the duplicates (67 articles) or the articles without abstracts (10 articles). Identified articles (n=8207). Articles underwent full text review (n=19). Abstract screening â€“ step 2: excluded articles (n=2676). Excluded based on the full text screening (n=6). Total of included articles (n=13).Included Eligibility Full text screening Abstract screening Identification Abstract screening â€“ step 1: excluded articles (n=77) Abstract screening â€“ step 3: excluded articles (n=4908). Abstract screening â€“ step 4: excluded articles (n=517). 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 Based on abstracts (i.e., step 2 of the abstracts screening), 2676 articles were removed due to the following reasons: (i) are not published in English (11 articles); (ii) are overviews or reviews (391 articles); (iii) are editorials, prefaces, and announcements of special issues, workshops or books (97 articles); or (iv) are not related to applications for smart cities (2177 articles). Afterwards, the abstracts of the remaining 5454 articles were analyzed and it was concluded that 536 articles were related to smart living (i.e., step 3 of the abstracts screening). Of these 536 articles, 437 articles were excluded because they are related smart living but not specifically related to health conditions of the individuals, and 80 articles were excluded because they are related to healthcare conditions, but are not related to active ageing (i.e., step 4 of the abstracts screening). Finally, from the remainder 19 articles, six articles were excluded during the full text review due to the following reasons: (i) one article is an overview [11]; (ii) one article was excluded because it was not possible to access the respective full text [12]; (iii) one article reports the development of applications that do not require smart city infrastructures [13]; (iv) one article presents a critical analysis of implementation the concept of smart city based on six indicators, namely smart people, smart economy, smart environment, smart government, smart living and smart mobility [14]; (v) one article presents a review of other works about the relation between unhealthy lifestyles and built environments, including smart cities [15]; and (vi) one article reports a study not directly related to smart city but to smart farming. The association to smart city was that farm relaxation is a type of city tourism [16]. Considering these remainder 13 articles, ten were published in conference proceedings and only three were published in scientific journals [17-19]. Based on their analysis, the following classes were considered: (i) monitoring applications; (ii) applications to support activities and participation; (iii) promotion of healthy lifestyles; and (iv) community platforms. 3.1. Monitoring Applications Within the scope of applications to monitor older adults, five articles [20-24] were considered. Villarrubia et al. [20] proposed an application that integrates WiFi networks deployed in rural areas to locate older adults in their homes and in specific nearby areas which they commonly frequent. An intelligent application with personalized multimedia content was used to control the locations. This was done through a topbox which was connected to a television and offers continuous monitoring of the individuals. The application was tested in a small locality in the province of Salamanca, Spain, being the tracking application activated in four homes equipped with a topbox set and a tracking tag in each one. The authors concluded that the developed application makes it easy to monitor older adults at a low cost since it is not necessary to install complex hardware, and because the hardware installed has other uses beyond monitoring. Still, regarding the monitoring application, it would be necessary to test it with more real data and load the case memory in the real anomalous cases in order to better analyze its functioning. Concerning [21], the final aim was to ensure a localization service for older adults that should be provided in time and when it is necessary, namely when older adults are outside (i.e., to enable the city to provide an outside individualsâ€™ monitoring while promoting their ability to perform leisure activities). The authors took advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm for collecting heterogeneous data that are broadcast in the city. In turn, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) were used to communicate data resulting from the gathering of physiological parameters. The assessment of the location performance was done through a set of experimental simulations using the MATLAB environment. The same argument is followed in [22], which aims to present an architecture for a service to locate older adults. Through highlighting the importance of integrating the social resources of citizens into the core of what a smart city is, the ideas presented in [23] and [24], which take part of the same project (City4Age), use technologies to collect data related to older adults. Bryant et al. [23] provided a description of the first phase of the Birmingham City4Age. This pilot had adopted a user centric iterative design approach with 35 care receivers actively involved in all phases of the project to validate the data detection and intervention services.

The classification was performed by using a synthesis process based on the method proposed by Ghapanchi and Aurum [9] (i.e., terms and definitions used in the included articles were identified to create a primary list of application domains, which was afterwards refined by further analyses). In all these four steps the articles were analyzed by at least two authors. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved by consensus. Considering the included articles, for every article, the following information was registered in a data sheet prepared by the authors: (i) article authors, title and year of publication; (ii) aim of the study; (iii) details of the applications being reported; (iv) details of the applied research methods; (v) methods applied for the evaluation of the applications; (vi) results; and (vii) authorsâ€™ interpretations. 3. Results This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [10] and Fig. 1 presents the respective flowchart. Fig. 1. PRISMA Flowchart. A total of 8207 articles were retrieved from the initial search on Web of Science, Scopus and IEEE Xplore (identification phase). The initial step of the screening phase (i.e., step 1 of the abstracts screening) yielded 8130 articles by removing the duplicates (67 articles) or the articles without abstracts (10 articles). Identified articles (n=8207). Articles underwent full text review (n=19). Abstract screening â€“ step 2: excluded articles (n=2676). Excluded based on the full text screening (n=6). Total of included articles (n=13).Included Eligibility Full text screening Abstract screening Identification Abstract screening â€“ step 1: excluded articles (n=77) Abstract screening â€“ step 3: excluded articles (n=4908). Abstract screening â€“ step 4: excluded articles (n=517). 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 Based on abstracts (i.e., step 2 of the abstracts screening), 2676 articles were removed due to the following reasons: (i) are not published in English (11 articles); (ii) are overviews or reviews (391 articles); (iii) are editorials, prefaces, and announcements of special issues, workshops or books (97 articles); or (iv) are not related to applications for smart cities (2177 articles). Afterwards, the abstracts of the remaining 5454 articles were analyzed and it was concluded that 536 articles were related to smart living (i.e., step 3 of the abstracts screening). Of these 536 articles, 437 articles were excluded because they are related smart living but not specifically related to health conditions of the individuals, and 80 articles were excluded because they are related to healthcare conditions, but are not related to active ageing (i.e., step 4 of the abstracts screening). Finally, from the remainder 19 articles, six articles were excluded during the full text review due to the following reasons: (i) one article is an overview [11]; (ii) one article was excluded because it was not possible to access the respective full text [12]; (iii) one article reports the development of applications that do not require smart city infrastructures [13]; (iv) one article presents a critical analysis of implementation the concept of smart city based on six indicators, namely smart people, smart economy, smart environment, smart government, smart living and smart mobility [14]; (v) one article presents a review of other works about the relation between unhealthy lifestyles and built environments, including smart cities [15]; and (vi) one article reports a study not directly related to smart city but to smart farming. The association to smart city was that farm relaxation is a type of city tourism [16]. Considering these remainder 13 articles, ten were published in conference proceedings and only three were published in scientific journals [17-19]. Based on their analysis, the following classes were considered: (i) monitoring applications; (ii) applications to support activities and participation; (iii) promotion of healthy lifestyles; and (iv) community platforms. 3.1. Monitoring Applications Within the scope of applications to monitor older adults, five articles [20-24] were considered. Villarrubia et al. [20] proposed an application that integrates WiFi networks deployed in rural areas to locate older adults in their homes and in specific nearby areas which they commonly frequent. An intelligent application with personalized multimedia content was used to control the locations. This was done through a topbox which was connected to a television and offers continuous monitoring of the individuals. The application was tested in a small locality in the province of Salamanca, Spain, being the tracking application activated in four homes equipped with a topbox set and a tracking tag in each one. The authors concluded that the developed application makes it easy to monitor older adults at a low cost since it is not necessary to install complex hardware, and because the hardware installed has other uses beyond monitoring. Still, regarding the monitoring application, it would be necessary to test it with more real data and load the case memory in the real anomalous cases in order to better analyze its functioning. Concerning [21], the final aim was to ensure a localization service for older adults that should be provided in time and when it is necessary, namely when older adults are outside (i.e., to enable the city to provide an outside individualsâ€™ monitoring while promoting their ability to perform leisure activities). The authors took advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm for collecting heterogeneous data that are broadcast in the city. In turn, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) were used to communicate data resulting from the gathering of physiological parameters. The assessment of the location performance was done through a set of experimental simulations using the MATLAB environment. The same argument is followed in [22], which aims to present an architecture for a service to locate older adults. Through highlighting the importance of integrating the social resources of citizens into the core of what a smart city is, the ideas presented in [23] and [24], which take part of the same project (City4Age), use technologies to collect data related to older adults. Bryant et al. [23] provided a description of the first phase of the Birmingham City4Age. This pilot had adopted a user centric iterative design approach with 35 care receivers actively involved in all phases of the project to validate the data detection and intervention services. For that it was used advances in wearables, smart phones and sensors to collect and process vast amounts of data in real time to enhance and build a more comprehensive and predictive 310 Nelson Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 306â€“313 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 picture of individualsâ€™ wellbeing and health, which aims to sustain better health outcomes and deliver early interventions to anticipate needs. In turn, [24] presents an architecture with two main elements: (i) an IoT infrastructure able to provide a range of ICT applications and services that, in a completely unobtrusive manner, gathers a large amount of personal data from older adults, both at home and public spaces; and (ii) a combination of a high performance Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) that allows to manage large quantities of data easily and a Linked Open Data (LOD) that maps the information in the database to Ontology Web Language (OWL), providing semantic meaning to the stored data and making it easier to share. It is worthwhile mentioning that an application has been developed but it was only a prototype. 3.2. Applications to Support Activities and Participation Three articles are focused on technologies supporting older adultsâ€™ activities and participation [17,25,26]. Zschippig & Kluss [17] present guidelines for the implementation of intelligent AAL gardens, raising awareness that gardening is a leisure activity which should be supported through ICT, as it is popular for older adults. The rationale is that, since the garden is to be part of the AAL home and not a separate application, features known from existing AAL applications, such as activity recognition, fall detection or health monitoring, should be expanded into the outdoor areas of the garden. The concept was presented only in a descriptive manner, and the authors concluded that the fully automated, unsupervised maintenance of the comprehensive AAL garden is likely to require more research efforts in the field of robotics and socio-technological systems to achieve practical and desirable applications. In turn, Lopez-de-Ipina et al. [25] propose a proof of concept platform for ambient assisted cities able to sense the city activities in order to promote the creation of an ecosystem of user-centric apps to help citizens, taking into account their disabilities, in their daily activities. This platform was developed within a research project, and the report is a work-in-progress and an opportunity for the authors to explain how are bring together the achievements of earlier works. With respect to [26], the idea was to highlight the potential of technology in public urban areas to raise awareness. According to the authors, smart urban objects are elements of the urban environment (e.g., posts, bulletin boards or benches), which might be connected to a digital information space to allow for implicit or explicit interaction with the individuals. By pondering theoretically on the subject, the authors argued that there is still a major challenge for research to determine how to design human computer interaction for walk-up-and-use in public spaces. 3.3. Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles Three articles are focused the promotion of healthy lifestyles [18,19,27]. Trencher & Karvonen [18] present a real-world case study on the Japanese smart city of Kashiwanoha, which follows three main approaches: (i) monitoring devices (e.g., wearable activity sensors, pedometers or scales) to capture continuous lifestyle data; (ii) provision of educational initiatives concentrated in walking, diet, and socializing; and (iii) enticement for behavioral change, including gamification based on the collected lifestyle data. An open-door policy allowed for free use by out-of-town residents and there were several users who lived in neighboring cities. Moreover, although the facility was for all ages, about two-thirds of the regulars were over 60 years old. The study found that citizens were well engaged in using these three approaches and were observed concrete changes in their behavior towards a healthier lifestyle. In [19] is reported a context-aware recommender application that offers personalized recommendations of exercise routes to individuals according to their medical condition and real-time information from a smart city. The application has predefined routes and recommends the best route based on a memory-based method that employs neighborhood search (to determine groups of similar individuals) and on information acquired from the smart city infrastructure such as air quality, ultraviolet radiation, wind speed, temperature, or precipitation. The individuals can then select the best course according to their profile (e.g., age, effort or distance) and can inform the application about unexpected situations that could affect other users. Moreover, they can also propose new routes. The 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 application was configured for two cities and first tested with simulated users which age distribution and medical statistics followed the reports of the World Health Organization and the World Heart Federation. Later, a real trial was conducted with 20 individuals for one city and it was found that the quality of the recommendations was like the one obtained by simulation. Stibe et al. [27] introduced the concept of persuasive cities by presenting an ecosystem for the future of cities. They proposed a strategy that was also included in [18], the behavioral change with gamification. Therefore, the article explains how to define behavior change and reports tools for the social engineering of persuasive cities. Although the strategy does not imply having a smart city to be applied, from the discussion and from the examples is inferred that a smart city is a key enabler of such approach in a city context. The authors advance possible scenarios were their concept could be used, such as reducing sedentary behavior, increasing water conservation, and promoting walking. However, for testing its effectiveness in the long run, robust evidence is required. 3.4. Community Platforms Two articles address the topic of older adultsâ€™ community platforms [28,29]. The aim of [28] was to expand the current visions of smart cities for older adults by building along three main dimensions: technology, agency and community. Following a case study approach, the authors developed a web- based community platform to offer three types of services related with mutual help, local events and local businesses. Over 100 active and independent individuals (aged 60-81) were involved in two case studies of age- friendly smart communities, which ranged from designing a mutual help service to co-creating routes of geo-located information about different topics. In this study, conducted in Ã€gora, Barcelona, Spain, urban technologies were dynamically integrated within the ecosystem of existing technologies and communication practices and acted as triggers of new community behaviors. The authors concluded by emphasizing the importance of looking at creative use when pursuing innovation in smart cities. With respect to [29], the authors focused on an intergenerational database and on the development of a prototype for mobile devices to allow collaborative creation of walking routes based on georeferenced points of interest. Providing the theoretical and methodological background of the project Viseu InterAge Stories (VIAS), which was not yet implemented, the idea was to follow a participatory design method, involving ethnographic and action research studies, including workshops with local participants of different generations. Therefore, intergenerational activities were explored, namely by mapping the points of interest with books value and associated physical activity. According the expected path, the authors anticipated developing a mobile application able to promote collaborative interaction practices among different generations. 4. Discussion and Conclusion Looking for the first research question (i.e., relevant smart city applications related to active ageing), four domains emerged the systematic review: (i) monitoring applications (five articles); (ii) applications to support activities and participation (three articles); (iii) promotion of healthy lifestyles, namely physical activity (three articles); and (iv) community platforms (two articles). These results show that smart cities might facilitate active ageing and are in line with current concerns: applications to support remote monitoring, activities, participation, and healthy lifestyles, as well as ageing in place [30]. In terms of the types of technologies being used (i.e., the second research question), together with data acquired from the smart city infrastructure (e.g., air quality, pollution, noise, light conditions, temperature, or precipitation) [19], wearable sensors that are gradually being pushed into the market, were used to acquire continuous lifestyle data (e.g., location of individuals [20-22,29], activity [17,18,23-25], physiological parameters [17,18,23,24], social interactions [26], and crowd behaviors [27]). Moreover, algorithms are proposed to process these data [19]. Additionally, one articles report the use of social media [28]. Finally in what concerns the third research question (i. e. maturity level of the applications being reported), three articles [17,26,29] propose concepts for further development, two articles, [23,24], are related to the same project (City4Age project) and report ongoing activities to requirements elicitation using interactive design approach, two Nelson Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 306â€“313 311 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 picture of individualsâ€™ wellbeing and health, which aims to sustain better health outcomes and deliver early interventions to anticipate needs.

Moreover, algorithms are proposed to process these data [19]. Additionally, one articles report the use of social media [28]. Finally in what concerns the third research question (i. e. maturity level of the applications being reported), three articles [17,26,29] propose concepts for further development, two articles, [23,24], are related to the same project (City4Age project) and report ongoing activities to requirements elicitation using interactive design approach, two 312 Nelson Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 306â€“313 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 7 articles purpose theoretical models that were validated using simulation techniques [19,21], one article defines an architecture [22], two articles present prototypes that were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts [25,27] and three articles report prototypes that were assessed by real users [18,20,28]. It is worthwhile to mention that only three articles refer concerns related to accessibility [17,24,25] and, surprisingly, only in one article, [29], the authors refer the intention to perform usability assessment of the applications being developed. This seems to be common to other areas [31]. To conclude, most of the 13 included articles reporting smart citiesâ€™ applications to promote active ageing are either of descriptive and conceptual nature or in an early stage of development. Moreover, most of the included references published in conference proceedings. As an additional remark, many of the reported studies are part of funded projects. As such, the articles, not only appear to be an opportunity to broadcast the projects, but as most of the studies are still ongoing, there is still a lack of concreteness and, accordingly, results are scarce. Another aspect that deserves attention is the fact that the number of references resulting is not very representative within the total of articles related to smart cities. On the other hand, the implementation of smart cities is still not largely imbued within the healthy and active ageing domain, but this symbiosis should be explored. Finally, though many articles focusing on smart cities tend generally to describe technological solutions, within the topic under study there are several articles that underline the importance of going beyond technological determinisms and, accordingly, consider the citizensâ€™ perspectives. In other words, technologies should respond to user needs and not the other way around. As such, in these papers, data was collected through the application of questionnaires in order to develop solutions that fit user needs. In some cases, however, technology was used to collect data and/or promote usersâ€™ interaction during the process. An example is the use of technological platforms integrating various sources of information. Still, within this set of articles there seems to be a scarce concern in verifying the effectiveness of the solutions designed to fit the usersâ€™ perspectives. It is always possible to point out limitations about both the chosen keywords and the databases that were used in the research. Moreover, since most articles were published in conference proceedings, it should be borne in mind that, since there are many non-indexed conferences, there will certainly be similar articles that have not been included. It should also be noted that the grey literature was not considered in this review and that this can be seen as a gap of some significance, since it is assumed that there are many local field projects that are not published in scientific articles, but which will be reported in limited announcements (e.g., bulletins from city councils). In despite of these limitations, in methodological terms, the authors tried to guarantee that the review selection and the data extraction were rigorous, so that the results are relevant to identify applications supported in smart cities infrastructure that can promote active ageing.

ACM. Nelson Rocha et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 306â€“313 313 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 7 articles purpose theoretical models that were validated using simulation techniques [19,21], one article defines an architecture [22], two articles present prototypes that were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts [25,27] and three articles report prototypes that were assessed by real users [18,20,28]. It is worthwhile to mention that only three articles refer concerns related to accessibility [17,24,25] and, surprisingly, only in one article, [29], the authors refer the intention to perform usability assessment of the applications being developed. This seems to be common to other areas [31]. To conclude, most of the 13 included articles reporting smart citiesâ€™ applications to promote active ageing are either of descriptive and conceptual nature or in an early stage of development. Moreover, most of the included references published in conference proceedings. As an additional remark, many of the reported studies are part of funded projects. As such, the articles, not only appear to be an opportunity to broadcast the projects, but as most of the studies are still ongoing, there is still a lack of concreteness and, accordingly, results are scarce. Another aspect that deserves attention is the fact that the number of references resulting is not very representative within the total of articles related to smart cities. On the other hand, the implementation of smart cities is still not largely imbued within the healthy and active ageing domain, but this symbiosis should be explored. Finally, though many articles focusing on smart cities tend generally to describe technological solutions, within the topic under study there are several articles that underline the importance of going beyond technological determinisms and, accordingly, consider the citizensâ€™ perspectives. In other words, technologies should respond to user needs and not the other way around. As such, in these papers, data was collected through the application of questionnaires in order to develop solutions that fit user needs. In some cases, however, technology was used to collect data and/or promote usersâ€™ interaction during the process. An example is the use of technological platforms integrating various sources of information. Still, within this set of articles there seems to be a scarce concern in verifying the effectiveness of the solutions designed to fit the usersâ€™ perspectives. It is always possible to point out limitations about both the chosen keywords and the databases that were used in the research. Moreover, since most articles were published in conference proceedings, it should be borne in mind that, since there are many non-indexed conferences, there will certainly be similar articles that have not been included. It should also be noted that the grey literature was not considered in this review and that this can be seen as a gap of some significance, since it is assumed that there are many local field projects that are not published in scientific articles, but which will be reported in limited announcements (e.g., bulletins from city councils). In despite of these limitations, in methodological terms, the authors tried to guarantee that the review selection and the data extraction were rigorous, so that the results are relevant to identify applications supported in smart cities infrastructure that can promote active ageing.

Introduction The authors were involved in the development of a platform of services, the Social Cooperation for Integrated Assisted Living (SOCIAL) platform, which intends to provide core components that are required to introduce a range of coherent applications to support community-dwelling older adults [1,2]. These applications should ensure integrated, consistent and cross-cutting view of the information, and efficient communication mechanisms, in order to contribute to care integration, empowerment of older adults and their informal caregivers, and strengthen of social care institutions. The study reported by the present paper was focused on the core components of the SOCIAL platform, namely the services related to information persistence, authentication, authorization, logging and auditing. In addition to the description of the respective implementation, the paper also presents their assessment, which was based on an application scenario related to a social support office of a Portuguese municipality. The following sections present the motivation of the research work, the proposed technological solution, the respective assessment and a conclusion. 2. Background The ageing of the population and the consequent increase in resource consumption in the age group over 65 requires efficiency and effectiveness of care provision. Particularly, there is a need to evolve from a care provision predominantly focused on illness over a socially oriented care with a higher attention to quality of life and social support [3]. This concern is evident in the public policies of the last years in many countries, notably in European Union countries [4,5]. Regardless of the specific characteristics of each country, community care is accepted as an important component in the continuity and integration of care, a key issue for current care delivery systems to be able to respond and adjust to changing realities [4-9]. When looking at what people, namely older adults, want from care delivered in their homes, several issues emerge, such as: to consider the personsâ€™ needs together in a holistic and integrated way; to ensure that care is consistent and reliable; or to ensure that people are able to express their preferences, views and feelings and to understand their choices about local care options, including quality and financial issues [6]. Moreover, another important issue is the possibility to support older adults to do things themselves, including contribution to their local community [6]. To guarantee the provision of care services in the community, there are different types of interacting entities, namely public and private health care institutions, institutions providing social care services, formal and informal caregivers (e.g., relatives, friends, neighbors, volunteers or colleagues), life assistance providers (e.g., cleaning, transportation or delivering goods at home) or providers addressing less tangible values such as participation (e.g., to facilitate social, religious, civic and political participation). Moreover, there are supportive stakeholders, including authorities and supporters dealing with socio-economical and legal context of care provision, whose involvement is fundamental to ensure funding and to safeguard the legal framework in which service provision can reach the target public. In this respect, in many countries local authorities are one of the resources for the first contact with the population and have the responsibility to lead and supervise the provision of the care in the community [10-13]. Currently, in order to maximize care provision in terms of quality, access, effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction, attention is focused in a rapidly expanding of digital applications [6]. Digital technology can be used for prevention, to promote the engagement between different levels or care (e.g., primary and secondary care, or health and social care), to support paid and unpaid care providers, or to improve productivity and quality by enabling new ways of working and facilitating information flow and, therefore, promoting more integrated and responsive services. Different groups of technologies, although focused in specific aspects, can contribute for the care in the community, so that older adults might live safely, independently, autonomously, and comfortably in their own residences, but with the necessary support services to their changing needs [14], including those resulting from multiple impairments (e.g., declines in cognitive and functional abilities) [15, 16].

In this respect, in many countries local authorities are one of the resources for the first contact with the population and have the responsibility to lead and supervise the provision of the care in the community [10-13].

Different groups of technologies, although focused in specific aspects, can contribute for the care in the community, so that older adults might live safely, independently, autonomously, and comfortably in their own residences, but with the necessary support services to their changing needs [14], including those resulting from multiple impairments (e.g., declines in cognitive and functional abilities) [15, 16]. 316 Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 314â€“321 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 Among these groups of technologies, mobile health (mhealth) [17] and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) [18,19] have been object of relevant research. The first, mhealth, is related to the increasing use of mobile devices and has been defined by the World Health Organization as â€œmedical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devicesâ€� [20]. Since health care services involve multiple locations (e.g., clinics, outpatientsâ€™ services or patientsâ€™ homes) they are highly mobile in nature [21], which means that mhealth might support communication and collaboration among different health professionals in activities related to disease diagnosis, drug reference, medical calculations or literature search, among others. In turn, AAL concerns and developments are in line with the active ageing framework of World Health Organization [22]. Enabling instruments such as ALL are essential, considering the fact that as people age their quality of life (i.e., perception of the position in life in the context of the surrounding culture and value system) is largely determined by their ability to maintain autonomy (i.e., ability to control, cope with and make personal decisions on a day-to-day basis) and independence (i.e., the ability to perform functions related to daily living with no or little help from others) [22]. While mhealth emphasizes mobility and considers applications to support the care of the patients in their homes as well as applications to be used in clinical environments for professional activities (e.g., training of medical students), ALL might include static devices and intends to support older adults living at home not only in aspects related to health care but also independent living. Irrespective of their precise definition, both mhealth and AAL applications might allow the patients to receive information from a variety of media to better control their diseases (e.g., educational information or prescriptions reminders) or to provide additional clinical information. Furthermore, the advances on sensing technology made possible the development of mobile and wearable Personal Health Devices (PHD) able to continuously monitor: physiological parameters in out-hospital conditions (e.g., measurement of blood pressure or blood glucose) [23,24]; and behaviours and daily activities (i.e., identifying consistency and completeness in these activities) to assess, in a naturalistic and continuous way, health and cognitive status [23]. These monitoring applications might help to automate assistance, to prevent the exacerbating of disease or accidents, and to properly react to emergency situations [23,25]. However, the existence of a wide range of technological possibilities is not enough for their applicability. Mobilizing health and social care in the community is a challenging issue worldwide [3], since organizational issues must also be considered, namely the integration of the care provision. In this respect, the SOCIAL platform [1] aims to contribute for the care integration by providing information services designed to support the care of community- dwelling older adults. 3. Proposal Elsewhere [1,2], it was reported the requirementsâ€™ analysis of the SOCIAL platform. Importance was given to the need of ensuring: extensibility, reusability, configurability, flexibility, and maintainability to facilitate the deployment of new applications; ethical and regulatory requirements, including the applicable regulations to guarantee inviolability and transparency of the information being gathered (e.g., EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals); and conformance to international standards to safeguard interoperability and information confidentiality, privacy and security. A key challenge faced by many care organizations is the need to share and exchange patientsâ€™ information. Therefore, efficient interoperability mechanisms to connect fragmented patient information are required as an effort to move from a fee-for-service to a value-based services focused on outcomes and populations. To enable interoperability across organizations, the adoption and use of international standards are fundamental. In this respect, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has become increasingly important to provide longitudinal records of patientsâ€™ health and healthcare because it combines the best features of other known specifications, such as HL7 v2, HL7 v3, or Clinical Document. Another concern is related to the fact that many of the available digital technologies use broadcast wireless communications, global network connectivity and shared hosting of data and computations based on cloud computing [26]. Moreover, the SOCIAL platform is related to an environment composed by a significant number of dispersed resources that can be accessed by a broad range of users that are distributed, both in geographical terms and in the administrative terms. Therefore, privacy, integrity and confidentiality of the information need to be 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 assured in a transparent way, easy to maintain, and supported on a strong granularity in terms of the definition of different authorization levels. For that, it is required: ï‚· Authentication, aiming to provide the identification of the users. ï‚· Authorization aiming to regulate access to the information, including the establishment of access controls to limit personnel access, which is challenged by a diverse set of policies, complexity of workflows and high risk of denying access to key information. ï‚· Logging and auditing to be possible to trace which users look at which records so an auditor can use this information to detect abuses. Therefore, in terms of information storage and retrieve, the Create, Read, Delete and Update (CRUD) operations include a set of complementary processes. Namely, during the authentication process, the usersâ€™ credentials are analyzed and a notification is stored by the logging service. Furthermore, a token is generated with several identifying elements of the entity that is accessing the information, such as the respective role. Based on the generated token, the access control component should analyze the request and forwards its decision to be registered and to authorize the CRUD operations. When the information persistence component receives a positive response from the access control, it can perform the requested CRUD operation. To support these operations, the SOCIAL platform, which is based on a services-oriented architecture, provides a set of common services, namely information persistence (e.g., validation, storage, reconstitution and search of information) and authentication, authorization, logging and auditing services [27] (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. System Architecture. 3.1. Information Persistence Different technologies (e.g., Java, Maven, REST, Spring Boot, Spring Data or MongoDB) were used to develop the information persistence service, which provides an interface for sending and receiving information, according to the FHIR standard. In terms of the information model to support the various applications, the fundamental entity is the Person FHIR resource [28]. The individuals interacting with the SOCIAL platform (e.g., assisted persons, informal care providers Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 314â€“321 317 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 Among these groups of technologies, mobile health (mhealth) [17] and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) [18,19] have been object of relevant research.

Fig. 1. System Architecture. 3.1. Information Persistence Different technologies (e.g., Java, Maven, REST, Spring Boot, Spring Data or MongoDB) were used to develop the information persistence service, which provides an interface for sending and receiving information, according to the FHIR standard. In terms of the information model to support the various applications, the fundamental entity is the Person FHIR resource [28]. The individuals interacting with the SOCIAL platform (e.g., assisted persons, informal care providers 318 Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 314â€“321 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 or formal care providers) have identities and, therefore, are considered Persons that might have several roles. Regardless of the role they play on the platform, their demographic information should be registered. Moreover, in the case of formal care providers, they may belong to a given institution (e.g., a health care or a social care institution, or even a City Council or a Borough Council). The Person FHIR resource might be associated to several instantiations belonging to the same user, allowing the different roles that each user can assume within the platform. In the case of users assuming the role of care provider, they can be characterized by the following FHIR resources: Practitioner (i.e., a person who is directly or indirectly involved in the provisioning of care); Practitioner Role resource (i.e., a specific set of roles, locations, specialties or services that a care provider may perform at an institution during a period of time); and Organization resource (i.e., a formally or informally recognized grouping of people or institutions organized for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action). For each CRUD request a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) following the standard RFC 7519 [29] is required. Every time that a request arrives, the JWT is validated in order to be possible to access the requested information. This is one of the security measures to confine the information to undue requests. Moreover, the requests are all submitted to the authorization service so the information can be retrieved according to permissions associated to a specific role. The JWT is used by the authorization service to get the role, so that rules previously defined are applied for the decision if the requested operation can or cannot be achieved. For positive decisions, the persistence service is responsible to perform the requested operation. Considering a Read request, some fields can be omitted according to usersâ€™ permissions. The other operations (i.e., Create, Update or Delete) can be permitted or denied. 3.2. Authentication The authentication component is supported by a REST architecture and allows the registration of specific users in the SOCIAL platform, the assignment of the respective roles and the verification of their identities [27]. If a user authentication is successfully validated, the service returns a JWT. This JWT enables the secure exchange of information between parties and has attributes for the verification of the user identity so that information accesses can be authorized. One of the available JWT attributes is the role that identifies the profile with which the user is currently operating. The role acts as a permission aggregator that is managed by the authorization component. Since a JWT is present in the all the communications between the various components of the SOCIAL platform, each one of these components holds an encrypted private key to verify veracity and validity of the JWT they received. 3.3. Authorization The FHIR resources may have security labels for three different purposes: to indicate the permissions related to information operations, such as Create or Read; to indicate what resources can be returned; and to indicate how specific information should be dealt with. Requests can also add their own security labels (e.g., break-the-glass protocol to allow a physician dealing with an emergency to access information of patient even when has not access permissions). The security label can have different categorizations, such as confidentiality, sensitivity, compartment, integrity or handling. Integrating Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) or Role-based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms with FHIR is possible, since the FHIR resources are also defined by their attributes. The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [30] is a standard that allows handling requests, regarding data access, using an ABAC policy language. These requests related to the access of specific resources are analyzed through a set of rules, so that a decision can be achieved. By using XACML, pre-established rules can be divided into different categories. The decision for the access request is obtained after comparing all the values of the attributes of the respective categories, between the request and the previously defined rules. Depending on how a specific decision rule was defined, a request result can be a denial or a permit. Furthermore, policies and their respective rules can have different levels of detail, according to the different number of attributes needed before reaching a decision [27]. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3.4. Logging and Auditing The logging and auditing component, as the remainder components, is based on a REST architecture, allowing the communication of the different services and applications of the SOCIAL platform via HTTP. A cryptographic secure blockchain was adopted, which stores the events and the blocks (of the blockchain) in a special purpose database. Moreover, audit processes will access the stored events and blocks to determine the relevant data. For that three separate processes were considered: log insertion, log consensus and log audit [27]. Log insertion is triggered when a service event occurs in the SOCIAL platform. The data describing the event is sent to the logging service as an HTTP Post with the event inserted in its request body, as a JSON Object. The service processes its contents and categorizes the different elements involved in the event (e.g., date, user or application), so that it can construct the appropriate document to be persisted. These requests must also have a JWT, which is used to verify signatures (using an algorithm and a secret key previously established) and to validate requested events. The log integrity is validated locally upon block insertion, which happens at fixed intervals. Inserting a block requires the validation of the previous blocks in the chain (either by that service or offloaded to horizontally scalable instances), and the registration of the log entries that are pending to be inserted. This creates interdependencies between log entries from multiple sources, limiting single source spoofing by an adversary. Log consensus is achieved by sending data from the blocks inserted between two wider time frames, to application or services belonging to the same ecosystem, which should reply with proofs of integrity. Each proof contains a digital signature, which may follow the standard X.509 time stamping practices. It can consist of full logs, allowing the effective replication of the entire event log and block chain in external services. However, only minimal indirect validation is possible, by synchronizing the block chain without actual log data, which is a tradeoff between performance and resilience to failures as well as audit effectiveness. Log audit is done by direct observation of the event stream stored in the database. Existing tools such as Kibana can be used and the integrity of the data observed can be assured. The integrity of the chain can be verified anytime to check for any inconsistencies. Since every block of the chain has a clear identification, with fingerprints of the log data, as well as time stamps of the first and last event during that time period, the hash of all the events occurred between two checkpoints can be recalculated to check if it matches the one stored in the block. The next and previous hash fields on every block can also be used to verify if the block itself has not been tampered. 4. Application Scenario An application scenario was thought to be evaluated in a real conditions pilot. For that, the functional requirements of the social support office from one municipality involved in the project were considered, according to a user-centered approach [31]. A social support office intends to support older adults living independently by answer to various types of assistance requests and deliver several programs to promote quality of life and active ageing. In this respect, a request for assistance must be understood as the possibility to create requests for specific needs or to report an anomalous situation. In turn, programs are initiatives composed by different types of activities, such as physical activity (e.g., swimming or marching), and sociocultural activities (e.g., theatre or dance) [2]. Therefore, different actors must be considered as well different types of applications [2]. In terms of actors there are care receivers and their informal caregivers (e.g., to request for assistance, to access to information, plans or notifications, to apply, register and withdraw programs and activities, or to provide feedback); help desk assistants (e.g., to provide information of certain activities to potential participants or to enroll participants), case managers (e.g., to access to plans and notifications); operational assistants and external entities (e.g., to know actions to be performed), head of the social support office (e.g., allocation of human, material and economic resources), and member of the City Council (e.g., evaluation of the performance of the social support office). In terms of applications, mobile and web applications were considered to target the care receivers and their informal caregivers (e.g., MySocial application to manage personal information and specific situations or events, including assistance requests), care providers (e.g., SocialManagement application to manage assistance requests, programs and activities) and political authorities (e.g., SocialPlanning application based on the secondary use of anonymized data related to the care receivers) [2]. Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 314â€“321 319 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 or formal care providers) have identities and, therefore, are considered Persons that might have several roles. Regardless of the role they play on the platform, their demographic information should be registered. Moreover, in the case of formal care providers, they may belong to a given institution (e.g., a health care or a social care institution, or even a City Council or a Borough Council). The Person FHIR resource might be associated to several instantiations belonging to the same user, allowing the different roles that each user can assume within the platform. In the case of users assuming the role of care provider, they can be characterized by the following FHIR resources: Practitioner (i.e., a person who is directly or indirectly involved in the provisioning of care); Practitioner Role resource (i.e., a specific set of roles, locations, specialties or services that a care provider may perform at an institution during a period of time); and Organization resource (i.e., a formally or informally recognized grouping of people or institutions organized for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action). For each CRUD request a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) following the standard RFC 7519 [29] is required. Every time that a request arrives, the JWT is validated in order to be possible to access the requested information. This is one of the security measures to confine the information to undue requests. Moreover, the requests are all submitted to the authorization service so the information can be retrieved according to permissions associated to a specific role. The JWT is used by the authorization service to get the role, so that rules previously defined are applied for the decision if the requested operation can or cannot be achieved. For positive decisions, the persistence service is responsible to perform the requested operation. Considering a Read request, some fields can be omitted according to usersâ€™ permissions. The other operations (i.e., Create, Update or Delete) can be permitted or denied. 3.2. Authentication The authentication component is supported by a REST architecture and allows the registration of specific users in the SOCIAL platform, the assignment of the respective roles and the verification of their identities [27]. If a user authentication is successfully validated, the service returns a JWT. This JWT enables the secure exchange of information between parties and has attributes for the verification of the user identity so that information accesses can be authorized. One of the available JWT attributes is the role that identifies the profile with which the user is currently operating. The role acts as a permission aggregator that is managed by the authorization component. Since a JWT is present in the all the communications between the various components of the SOCIAL platform, each one of these components holds an encrypted private key to verify veracity and validity of the JWT they received. 3.3. Authorization The FHIR resources may have security labels for three different purposes: to indicate the permissions related to information operations, such as Create or Read; to indicate what resources can be returned; and to indicate how specific information should be dealt with. Requests can also add their own security labels (e.g., break-the-glass protocol to allow a physician dealing with an emergency to access information of patient even when has not access permissions). The security label can have different categorizations, such as confidentiality, sensitivity, compartment, integrity or handling. Integrating Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) or Role-based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms with FHIR is possible, since the FHIR resources are also defined by their attributes. The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [30] is a standard that allows handling requests, regarding data access, using an ABAC policy language. These requests related to the access of specific resources are analyzed through a set of rules, so that a decision can be achieved. By using XACML, pre-established rules can be divided into different categories. The decision for the access request is obtained after comparing all the values of the attributes of the respective categories, between the request and the previously defined rules. Depending on how a specific decision rule was defined, a request result can be a denial or a permit. Furthermore, policies and their respective rules can have different levels of detail, according to the different number of attributes needed before reaching a decision [27]. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3.4. Logging and Auditing The logging and auditing component, as the remainder components, is based on a REST architecture, allowing the communication of the different services and applications of the SOCIAL platform via HTTP. A cryptographic secure blockchain was adopted, which stores the events and the blocks (of the blockchain) in a special purpose database. Moreover, audit processes will access the stored events and blocks to determine the relevant data. For that three separate processes were considered: log insertion, log consensus and log audit [27]. Log insertion is triggered when a service event occurs in the SOCIAL platform. The data describing the event is sent to the logging service as an HTTP Post with the event inserted in its request body, as a JSON Object. The service processes its contents and categorizes the different elements involved in the event (e.g., date, user or application), so that it can construct the appropriate document to be persisted. These requests must also have a JWT, which is used to verify signatures (using an algorithm and a secret key previously established) and to validate requested events. The log integrity is validated locally upon block insertion, which happens at fixed intervals. Inserting a block requires the validation of the previous blocks in the chain (either by that service or offloaded to horizontally scalable instances), and the registration of the log entries that are pending to be inserted. This creates interdependencies between log entries from multiple sources, limiting single source spoofing by an adversary. Log consensus is achieved by sending data from the blocks inserted between two wider time frames, to application or services belonging to the same ecosystem, which should reply with proofs of integrity. Each proof contains a digital signature, which may follow the standard X.509 time stamping practices. It can consist of full logs, allowing the effective replication of the entire event log and block chain in external services. However, only minimal indirect validation is possible, by synchronizing the block chain without actual log data, which is a tradeoff between performance and resilience to failures as well as audit effectiveness. Log audit is done by direct observation of the event stream stored in the database. Existing tools such as Kibana can be used and the integrity of the data observed can be assured. The integrity of the chain can be verified anytime to check for any inconsistencies. Since every block of the chain has a clear identification, with fingerprints of the log data, as well as time stamps of the first and last event during that time period, the hash of all the events occurred between two checkpoints can be recalculated to check if it matches the one stored in the block. The next and previous hash fields on every block can also be used to verify if the block itself has not been tampered. 4. Application Scenario An application scenario was thought to be evaluated in a real conditions pilot. For that, the functional requirements of the social support office from one municipality involved in the project were considered, according to a user-centered approach [31]. A social support office intends to support older adults living independently by answer to various types of assistance requests and deliver several programs to promote quality of life and active ageing. In this respect, a request for assistance must be understood as the possibility to create requests for specific needs or to report an anomalous situation. In turn, programs are initiatives composed by different types of activities, such as physical activity (e.g., swimming or marching), and sociocultural activities (e.g., theatre or dance) [2]. Therefore, different actors must be considered as well different types of applications [2]. In terms of actors there are care receivers and their informal caregivers (e.g., to request for assistance, to access to information, plans or notifications, to apply, register and withdraw programs and activities, or to provide feedback); help desk assistants (e.g., to provide information of certain activities to potential participants or to enroll participants), case managers (e.g., to access to plans and notifications); operational assistants and external entities (e.g., to know actions to be performed), head of the social support office (e.g., allocation of human, material and economic resources), and member of the City Council (e.g., evaluation of the performance of the social support office). In terms of applications, mobile and web applications were considered to target the care receivers and their informal caregivers (e.g., MySocial application to manage personal information and specific situations or events, including assistance requests), care providers (e.g., SocialManagement application to manage assistance requests, programs and activities) and political authorities (e.g., SocialPlanning application based on the secondary use of anonymized data related to the care receivers) [2]. 320 Marco Rosa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 314â€“321 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 7 Before the implementation of a real conditions pilot, in addition to the usability assessment of the applications (which is not object of the present paper), the performance of the services of the SOCIAL platform was evaluated based on a laboratorial test. This test consisted in a random number of users (between 100 and 200 users) that for 60 minutes randomly accessed three concurrent applications (i.e., MySocial, SocialOperationManagement and SocialPlanning). This test scenario was created to answer the following questions: ï‚· For each user profile, what is the average delay time between a platform access with a token and the reception of the indication of all the operations that the specific profile can perform? ï‚· What is the delay time between a request to access a specific packet of information stored in the persistence service and the complete reception of all the information by the requesting application? The average delay time when performing a platform access with a token (i.e., to execute the flow from platform access with token until the presentation of the interface) varied according the specific profile, due to the different number and type of operations that each profile can perform: care receiver â€“ 111 ms; informal caregiver â€“ 113 ms; operational assistant â€“ 114 ms; case manager â€“ 114 ms; and member of the city council â€“ 120 ms. In turn, in what concerns the second question, the delay time for accessing packets (i.e., the flow from the start of a CRUD operation until the presentation of the respective results) containing lists of available programs or lists of patients is presented in Table 1. The results show that the SOCIAL platform can successful manage the access of the different user and application pairs. Table 1. Delay time. Types of Information Size Delay Lists of available programs 256 bytes [89â€“92] ms 1 kb [99â€“113] ms 64 kb [184â€“319] ms Lists of patients 305 bytes [88â€“197] ms 417 kb [1.3â€“1.6] s 5. Conclusion The present article reports a study with the objective of using FHIR with complex authentication, authorization, logging and auditing mechanisms to guarantee interoperability of a platform of services to support integrated care and assistance of community-dwelling older adults. The performance evaluation shows that is possible to guarantee efficiency in terms of information access by the different user application pairs. Currently, the authors are running a real conditions pilot in a municipality involved in the research study reported by the present article. During the pilot set-up, it was carried out the consolidation of all the registries of all the databases related to citizens requiring social services of the municipality. It was found that less than 30% of the registries were correctly filled and more than 25% of the individual data were duplicated. These results reveal the potential of platforms such as the SOCIAL platform.

Introduction The human functioning concept explains the interrelation between body structures and functions, individual activity and participation in society [1], and has become progressively more important due to the increasing of the average life expectancy and the consequent prevalence of chronic-related diseases [2]. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) [3] is based on a biopsychosocial approach that considers the functioning and health conditions depend on physical, personal and environmental aspects. The ICF belongs to the World Health Organization (WHO) family of classifications, the World Health Organization Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC), along with the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the International Classification of Health Interventions, still under development. The WHO-FIC has as a specific objective to provide a standardized form to compare clinical information at international, national or local level. In particular, the ICF offers a common language for describing health conditions and a comprehensive coding scheme, which is being used in areas as diverse as long-term care or special education. However, using the coding scheme proposed by ICF is a complex task, susceptible to errors and requires an excessive time from those involved. In addition, existing computer support tools only provide the presentation of the items of the different hierarchical levels of the ICF, such as the WHO website that provides a browser for querying the ICF hierarchy. In this context, the study reported in this article aimed to develop a web platform to help clinicians to codify observations and interventions according to the ICF. In the following sections, it will be presented the related work, the objectives of the present study, the architecture of the proposed platform, as well as details of the respective development and validation. Finally, in the last section, a conclusion is drawn, and the continuity of the research work is envisaged. 2. Related Work Traditionally, the functional capacity of the individual refers to how they perform a set of actions related to activities of daily living, social interactions, recreational activities and other behaviors associated with everyday life [4]. The disabilities result from the effects that health conditions have on body functions and structures and, consequently, on individualsâ€™ performance [3]. Many thought theories have influenced the definition of models that theorize the concepts of disability and functioning, namely, the medical model, the social model, and the biopsychosocial model [5]. The medical model portrays disease and disability as abnormalities that are translated into some level of functional limitation or disability that, under certain conditions, require clinical interventions for correction or compensation [6]. According to this paradigm, injury, illness or physical or psychological limitation are considered as a cause of social inequality and ravages with which individuals with disabilities might face [7]. The social model of disability, in turn, focuses on disability as a problem conceived by society and not as a characteristic of the individual [5]. The main concept is the social structure, being disability seen as a matter of life in society to the detriment of individual adversity, thus transferring responsibility from the disadvantages of the individualsâ€™ incapacities to the inability of society to anticipate and adapt to diversity. This understanding can promote the family, work and social insertion of the individual with some kind of disability [7]. Finally, the biopsychosocial model has been progressively established over the years. Its purpose is to try to integrate both previous models, the medical model and the social model of disability, by providing a complete view of the human being and his health conditions that integrates the physical, psychological and social dimensions [3]. Thus, disability is seen as a consequence of biological, personal and social forces. The interactions between these several factors result in disabilities [6]. Currently there are several models that are used at the rehabilitation level and which are based on a biopsychosocial perspective, namely: the Nagi disability model [8]; the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) [9]; the Disability Creation Process (DCP) [10]; and the ICF [3]. Among these models, the ICF is the latest and also the most comprehensive.

Thus, disability is seen as a consequence of biological, personal and social forces. The interactions between these several factors result in disabilities [6]. Currently there are several models that are used at the rehabilitation level and which are based on a biopsychosocial perspective, namely: the Nagi disability model [8]; the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) [9]; the Disability Creation Process (DCP) [10]; and the ICF [3]. Among these models, the ICF is the latest and also the most comprehensive. It privileges functioning as a component of health and considers the environment as a facilitator or a barrier to the performance of an individualsâ€™ 300 Ana Mendes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 298â€“305 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 functions and tasks. The primary aspect is the conceptualization of disability as a result of a set of situations and conditions that, in addition to health conditions, include the environment, living conditions as well as personal factors. Accordingly, the disabled individual is not seen as an individual with a disability, even though temporary, because the emphasis must be given to all the components that can favor or limit the performance of the various functions, both biological and social. Therefore, ICF advocates a shift from a disease-based view to a view based on the individualsâ€™ functioning as an essential component of health [3]. That is, unlike other models, the ICF considers a positive perspective for the functioning, but which, nevertheless, allows assess the degree of functional loss. Thus, ICF components, such as body structures, organ and system functions, activities, participation and environmental conditions, allow identifying what the individuals may or may not be able to do in their daily life [3]. A clinical classification aims to codify observations and interventions in accordance with standardized codes. In particular, the ICF is a hierarchical classification that uses an alphanumeric system. The letters b, s, d and e are used to denote the four domains of ICF, respectively, body functions, body structures, activities and participation, and environmental factors. Each domain is organized by chapters, where the letters are followed by the chapter number (digit). The next two digits represent the second level, followed by the third level (one digit), and lastly, the fourth level (one digit). The levels represent different resolution grades of the classification, that is, the broader categories may contain more detailed subcategories. For example, the Mobility (d4) chapter is included in the Activities and Participation (d) domain and includes several subcategories, such as â€˜walking and movingâ€™ (d450-d469), Â´changing and maintaining body positionâ€™ (d410-d429) and â€˜carrying, moving and handling objectsâ€™ (d430 -d449). It is possible to assign codes of different levels to the individual, which may be independent or interrelated [3]. For what has been presented, the ICF is conceptually very rich, so the coding process, i.e., the translation of clinical information collected and clinical interventions carried out in ICF codes, is a complex process, taking into account the diversity of the concepts involved, as well as the number of existing codes to codify such concepts. Moreover, it is also a process with some subjectivity, since the same information can be evaluated and classified differently by different encoders [2]. For that reason, the scientific literature reports coding processes carried out by two independent encoders who follow certain rules, with differences resolved by consensus, involving sometimes a third encoder [11]. Exacerbating this situation considerably, the degree of agreement between encoders is dependent on the knowledge they have about ICF, experience, education or professional training, and the type of information they pretend to codify. This compromises an adequate organization of the information to obtain epidemiological knowledge about populationsâ€™ functioning, disability and quality of life. Consequently, the development of tools based on information technologies to support ICF coding can contribute decisively to its operationalization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the scientific literature does not report the existence of such tools. 3. Objectives The ICF offers a systematic and meaningful ordering of information associated with human functioning, allowing the representation of an individualsâ€™ functional profile through the coding of clinical observations and interventions performed according to universal categories [12]. Two coding methods can be used for this. One can use previously validated qualifiers to codify the gathered information, while in another, each item of the collected information is codified casuistically [11]. Regardless of the method employed, as a result of the coding process it is possible to obtain a functioning profile. This, of course, may be more or less detailed, depending on the number of ICF categories used. Thus, the coding is dependent on the granularity (amount of codes considered essential for the profile), the experience of the encoders, and the greater or lesser alignment of the clinical evaluation instruments used (e.g., to codify the results of a functioning assessment instrument such as WHODAS II, a ICF-based instrument, is substantially easier than to codify information resulting from other evaluation instruments that are not directly based on the ICF). As an example of coding it is possible to consider the following therapeutic objective: â€˜to explore a toy with both hands for five minutes, without bringing it to the mouth, under the guidance of a relativeâ€™. The ICF code d1310 (i.e., â€˜learning through simple actions with a single objectâ€™) can be used to codify the action â€˜to explore a toy with both 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 handsâ€™. However, if the aim is also to consider the environmental factors then the ICF code e310 (â€˜immediate familyâ€™) must also be considered. In order to optimize the ICF coding, it is possible to record all the codifications made, namely those that have been consensual, and based on that register, be able to provide suggestions for each new item to be codified. In this way, when in the presence of previously codified items, an increase in the level of agreement between encoders is predicted. For example, if the goal is to codify the expression â€˜sit in the toiletâ€™, an encoder may feel tempted to encode this expression with code d4103 (i.e., â€˜sit - adopt a seated position with folded legsâ€™). However, closer examination reveals that the expression is self-care (e.g., d5300, which may mean â€˜regulating urination - adopting the appropriate positionâ€™), is more adequate. If this expression had previously been codified, other options than code d4103 could be suggested, thus reducing the probability of error. In order to minimize the difficulties associated with ICF coding, the authors have developed a web platform that presents a friendly interface with a simple, intuitive and consistent design. Additionally, it offers the following functions: ï‚· Accessing information of the ICF classification using personalized queries. ï‚· Submission of sample proposals for instances of codes, both in terms of inclusion and exclusion, in order to enrich the available suggestions. ï‚· Forum to discuss issues related to ICF coding. In terms of requirements analysis, in addition to those involved in coding processes, the users, it was also considered the existence of an administrator actor, who among other functions, must ensure the validation of the information inserted. 4. Architecture The solution chosen for the implementation of the web platform, called International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - Codification Platform (ICF-CP) [13], was the set of JavaScript-based technologies called MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Nodejs) Stack [14]. From the client to the server side, this solution is totally JavaScript. The client-side is responsible for the interaction with the user. For that, the client provides HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages, which enable the execution of the different actions. Each HTML page is associated with a component which, in turn, defines a class that contains the data and application logic. When the user performs an operation on the HTML file, triggers a function in the corresponding component through an event binding. In terms of access to the database, a consolidated interface was sought. Thus, if data is required from the database, it is necessary to invoke a service, as this operate as a client-side wrapper for the RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests are performed in the services, allowing data to be sent and received for the components. The request is carried out with an HTTP instance, which allows to invoke get, put, post or delete methods by passing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that will be the endpoint and may contain several parameters in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The manipulation and handling of errors is performed with the help of an observable map and catch operators that are also imported. From the serversâ€™ point of view, each request is initially accessed by Node.js threading and then sent to the server using Express. This last framework allows to configure applications, add routes and rest endpoints to boot the middleware. On the server is defined the base path for the file where the endpoints/routes with the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database (route.js) are located. In this file, an instance of the Express Router class is used to define RESTful API routes and several functions consisting of two arguments: a route and a callback function. If this route matches the URL sent in the HTTP request, then this function will be executed. The callback function contains the request and response objects as arguments. Within these functions, CRUD operations are performed on the MongoDB-supported database, with the help of Mongoose library-defined data models. The data models are schemas that map collections of MongoDB and define the format of the documents in it. Model Ana Mendes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 298â€“305 301 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 functions and tasks. The primary aspect is the conceptualization of disability as a result of a set of situations and conditions that, in addition to health conditions, include the environment, living conditions as well as personal factors. Accordingly, the disabled individual is not seen as an individual with a disability, even though temporary, because the emphasis must be given to all the components that can favor or limit the performance of the various functions, both biological and social. Therefore, ICF advocates a shift from a disease-based view to a view based on the individualsâ€™ functioning as an essential component of health [3]. That is, unlike other models, the ICF considers a positive perspective for the functioning, but which, nevertheless, allows assess the degree of functional loss. Thus, ICF components, such as body structures, organ and system functions, activities, participation and environmental conditions, allow identifying what the individuals may or may not be able to do in their daily life [3]. A clinical classification aims to codify observations and interventions in accordance with standardized codes. In particular, the ICF is a hierarchical classification that uses an alphanumeric system. The letters b, s, d and e are used to denote the four domains of ICF, respectively, body functions, body structures, activities and participation, and environmental factors. Each domain is organized by chapters, where the letters are followed by the chapter number (digit). The next two digits represent the second level, followed by the third level (one digit), and lastly, the fourth level (one digit). The levels represent different resolution grades of the classification, that is, the broader categories may contain more detailed subcategories. For example, the Mobility (d4) chapter is included in the Activities and Participation (d) domain and includes several subcategories, such as â€˜walking and movingâ€™ (d450-d469), Â´changing and maintaining body positionâ€™ (d410-d429) and â€˜carrying, moving and handling objectsâ€™ (d430 -d449). It is possible to assign codes of different levels to the individual, which may be independent or interrelated [3]. For what has been presented, the ICF is conceptually very rich, so the coding process, i.e., the translation of clinical information collected and clinical interventions carried out in ICF codes, is a complex process, taking into account the diversity of the concepts involved, as well as the number of existing codes to codify such concepts. Moreover, it is also a process with some subjectivity, since the same information can be evaluated and classified differently by different encoders [2]. For that reason, the scientific literature reports coding processes carried out by two independent encoders who follow certain rules, with differences resolved by consensus, involving sometimes a third encoder [11]. Exacerbating this situation considerably, the degree of agreement between encoders is dependent on the knowledge they have about ICF, experience, education or professional training, and the type of information they pretend to codify. This compromises an adequate organization of the information to obtain epidemiological knowledge about populationsâ€™ functioning, disability and quality of life. Consequently, the development of tools based on information technologies to support ICF coding can contribute decisively to its operationalization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the scientific literature does not report the existence of such tools. 3.

Within these functions, CRUD operations are performed on the MongoDB-supported database, with the help of Mongoose library-defined data models. The data models are schemas that map collections of MongoDB and define the format of the documents in it. Model 302 Ana Mendes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 298â€“305 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 instances are documents, which have a series of methods (e.g., create, save, remove or find) that allow storing and retrieving data from the database. Finally, the database response does the reverse. When it arrives at the service that made the HTTP request, with the map operator, the .json method is invoked to convert the data to JSON and send it to any subscriber (component) that is waiting for the response. An observable value is returned for the component, which, in order to access the response data, needs to subscribe and assign the data to a variable. This variable can be accessed by the HTML page, through property binding and presented to the user. From the implementation point of view, the first step was the creation of the MongoDB database. It consists of two collections: data and users. The last collection is intended only for the data of users who are registered in the system, while the first, data, contains the necessary remaining data for the operation of the web platform. Fig. 1 shows a diagram representing the structure of the various types of documents that can exist in the two collections. Fig. 1. Database diagram. The codes table shows the document structure of all ICF codes. However, only the name, code, and description fields are required. The changes field is an object with two document arrays, includes and excludes. This is intended to save changes that occur in the include and exclude fields, and therefore their existence depends on these two fields. The forumPosts table, as the name implies, refers to the data of the discussion topics created on the platform forum page. The approved and closed fields are ignored by default and started with false value. The topic is only displayed on the page if the administrator has approved it, that is, when the approved field is set to true field. When a topic no longer needs to be discussed, it can be finalized by the administrator (i.e., the value of the closed field becomes true). Proposals is the table to include or exclude proposals submitted by users. In addition to the information on each proposal, it includes positive votes (positiveVotes), negatives (negativeVotes) and their respective users (positiveUsers and negativeUsers). It also has a state that can be approved, rejected or for approval that is determined by the administratorsâ€™ action. Finally, the UsersToApprove table is intended for user data, which the administrator has not yet approved for registration on the platform. Once approved, this data is included in the usersâ€™ collection (Users table) and deleted from the current collection (Data table). After the creation of the database, the second step was to fill it with ICF data. The Portuguese National Institute for Rehabilitation provides several files in HTML format to download from its website. From these two hundred and sixty-five files, a Java project was developed, using the Netbeans IDE, with the purpose of extracting the data and 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 then inserting them into the MongoDB database. Initially a study of the HTML files was performed and later developed a pattern to extract all the required fields. In Fig. 2 it is possible to observe an example of a document structure containing information about code b110. It consists of _id, which is automatically generated by the title of the code (name), its code (code), its description (description), two arrays with examples that this domain can include or exclude, and, finally, a field with the history of changes made in this document (changes). This last field is an object with two document arrays, includes and excludes. If a change occurs in the includes field, is stored in the changes object - within the includes array - a new document with the name of the user that made the change (user), the date and time (time), and the respective change (descpt). Fig. 2. Example of a document structure. 5. Description of the Platform Implementation There are many web-development structures and libraries JavaScript-based. However, the most popular client- side technologies are the Angular and React. After a comparative study between the two tools for the development of the frontend was chosen the Angular. Both have their advantages and disadvantages and are excellent technologies, though there was more willingness to learn the Angular, more specifically the version 2. Applications developed in Angular 2 are separated into three parts: HTML templates, classes (plan from which objects are created) of components that generate the templates, and services that contain the business logic of the application. This approach allows rapid and logical development of applications and facilitates their testing. The ICF-CP provides a user-friendly interface to codify clinical interventions and their results. It has a simple, intuitive and consistent design, essentially with neutral colors. In this solution it is also possible to verify the existence of two types of actors: the system administrator and the system users. However, it should be noted that the latter is segmented into unregistered users, i.e., those who have not yet registered on the platform, as well as into users who have already registered, naming them as registered users. The platform interface has few functions before logging in, since most of these are only available after the session has started. For a non-logged in user the only function available is the ICF query and an optimized search method on it. For the users with approved registration, in addition to this function, they can also suggest examples to be classified as include or exclude, which may or may not be approved by the administrator. Still, can benefit from a forum to discuss possible examples to submit or other topics related to ICF, and a page with all proposals submitted by users, with their status and right to vote for those which have not yet been approved by the administrator. On the other hand, the administrator has access to additional functions. In addition to the ones a regular user has, the administrator can add or edit the include and exclude fields directly from the ICF and delete forum topics. Finally, the administrator also has an exclusive page, with a side menu with multiple options for managing users, their suggestions, forum topics and for viewing the history of all modifications. Fig. 3 shows the Code page, where the ICF documentation is located. As can be seen, it has a search field, with the option of placing filters (name, code, description, includes, excludes), if the user wants to search a word only in a Ana Mendes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 160 (2019) 298â€“305 303 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 instances are documents, which have a series of methods (e.g., create, save, remove or find) that allow storing and retrieving data from the database.

Regarding the ICF table, when selecting a line, it is possible to access the detail corresponding to the lower hierarchical level. When accessing level three of the ICF hierarchy it appears a button that allows the user to add a new include or exclude example. When the user selects this add button it is possible to associate additional information to the active ICF code, that is, include or exclude fields, and the description of the example that should be added for the administrator approval. For the administrator, an additional button appears, the edit, which allows the modification or deletion of an existing include or exclude example. Fig. 3. Code page. 6. Validation With the objective of evaluating the impact of the described platform, an experimental study was carried out to compare the levels of agreement between pair of encoders, with and without the platform. For this experimental study, it was used real data that resulted from a clinical study aiming to assess a rehabilitative approach based on contextual interventions for children with cerebral palsy or related neurological situations compared to the classical approach. The clinical study involved a total of 120 families from all over Portugal and ran for one year with weekly sessions. In all sessions, the clinicians recorded the therapeutic goals as well as the results of the interventions that were performed. From these records, for the validation of the platform, a set of therapeutic objectives (defined prior to the contextual intervention or objectives that were redefined after the interventions) were randomly selected from a total of ten sessions. To codify these registers a specific set of coding rules [11] adapted from Cieza et al. [15] were used. The validation of the platform proceeded in three distinct phases. Initially (phase 1), two encoders with similar experience with ICF coding independently coded the therapeutic goals without using the platform. Simultaneously, the encoders manually recorded the examples that they considered important to insert into the platform. After a process of comparison between the examples considered by the two encoders, and after the resolution of divergences by discussion until reaching the consensus, involving a third encoder, the suggestions were included in the platform (phase 2). Finally, in phase 3, two other encoders with a similar experience with ICF coding when compared with the phase 1 encoders, repeated the coding procedures using the platform described in this article. Moreover, in both phases the times each encoder spent in the coding process were recorded. In terms of results, an analysis was performed considering the ratio between the number of the total agreements and the total number of codifications made by the two pairs of encoders (i.e., phase 1 and phase 3). From this analysis there was a significant increase in the degree of agreement when the platform was used: the degree of agreement increased from 61.4% in phase 1 to 77.5% in phase 3. Additionally, it was verified that during phase 1, 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 without the platform, the time spent in the coding process by both phase 1 encoders was 350 minutes, while phase 3 encoders spent 130 minutes to codify the same registers using the platform. 7. Conclusion and Future Work In this article, the authors presented the development of a web platform, the ICF-CP, aiming to provide a user- friendly interface for coding clinical observations and interventions. An experimental study was carried out to compare the levels of agreement between pair of encoders and we may conclude that the platform can facilitate the ICF coding process by increasing the level of agreement and reducing the time spent by the encoders. Further research is planned to assess the performance of the platform with additional real data, including results of the interventions in addition to therapeutic goals, as well to evaluate the usability of the platform and to determine features to be included to further optimize the ICF coding process.

Regarding the ICF table, when selecting a line, it is possible to access the detail corresponding to the lower hierarchical level. When accessing level three of the ICF hierarchy it appears a button that allows the user to add a new include or exclude example. When the user selects this add button it is possible to associate additional information to the active ICF code, that is, include or exclude fields, and the description of the example that should be added for the administrator approval. For the administrator, an additional button appears, the edit, which allows the modification or deletion of an existing include or exclude example. Fig. 3. Code page. 6. Validation With the objective of evaluating the impact of the described platform, an experimental study was carried out to compare the levels of agreement between pair of encoders, with and without the platform. For this experimental study, it was used real data that resulted from a clinical study aiming to assess a rehabilitative approach based on contextual interventions for children with cerebral palsy or related neurological situations compared to the classical approach. The clinical study involved a total of 120 families from all over Portugal and ran for one year with weekly sessions. In all sessions, the clinicians recorded the therapeutic goals as well as the results of the interventions that were performed. From these records, for the validation of the platform, a set of therapeutic objectives (defined prior to the contextual intervention or objectives that were redefined after the interventions) were randomly selected from a total of ten sessions. To codify these registers a specific set of coding rules [11] adapted from Cieza et al. [15] were used. The validation of the platform proceeded in three distinct phases. Initially (phase 1), two encoders with similar experience with ICF coding independently coded the therapeutic goals without using the platform. Simultaneously, the encoders manually recorded the examples that they considered important to insert into the platform. After a process of comparison between the examples considered by the two encoders, and after the resolution of divergences by discussion until reaching the consensus, involving a third encoder, the suggestions were included in the platform (phase 2). Finally, in phase 3, two other encoders with a similar experience with ICF coding when compared with the phase 1 encoders, repeated the coding procedures using the platform described in this article. Moreover, in both phases the times each encoder spent in the coding process were recorded. In terms of results, an analysis was performed considering the ratio between the number of the total agreements and the total number of codifications made by the two pairs of encoders (i.e., phase 1 and phase 3). From this analysis there was a significant increase in the degree of agreement when the platform was used: the degree of agreement increased from 61.4% in phase 1 to 77.5% in phase 3. Additionally, it was verified that during phase 1, 8 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 without the platform, the time spent in the coding process by both phase 1 encoders was 350 minutes, while phase 3 encoders spent 130 minutes to codify the same registers using the platform. 7. Conclusion and Future Work In this article, the authors presented the development of a web platform, the ICF-CP, aiming to provide a user- friendly interface for coding clinical observations and interventions. An experimental study was carried out to compare the levels of agreement between pair of encoders and we may conclude that the platform can facilitate the ICF coding process by increasing the level of agreement and reducing the time spent by the encoders. Further research is planned to assess the performance of the platform with additional real data, including results of the interventions in addition to therapeutic goals, as well to evaluate the usability of the platform and to determine features to be included to further optimize the ICF coding process.

The SClínico is an EHR system widely used in public hospitals and primary care centres of the Portuguese National Health Service and the present article reports the assessment of its usability. This usability assessment consisted in three stages: in the first stage, an exploratory assessment was carried out, while in the second stage a quantitative assessment was performed using a validated usability assessment instrument, and, finally, in the third stage a focus group involving clinicians and usability experts was conducted. The results showed that SClínico presents important usability issues and, therefore, recommendations are suggested to overcome the identified issues.",

All rights reserved.The increase of elderly population creates the need to promote healthy aging, with autonomy and independence, for preserving the functional capacity and quality of life as much as possible. To achieve this goal the recommendations include walking a certain amount of steps daily, given that the exact amount of steps changes with age, lesions, and chronic health conditions that can affect health and well-being. Understanding how much exercise is adequate for an individual requires specialized knowledge and training. It is important to avoid risks that include: (1) be too aggressive in exercising and increase injuries, create new ones, and later refrain in exercising more; or (2) be too conservative and in the long run have an activity level under each one’s potential and below what is recommended. In this article is proposed and discussed a framework that aims to support people having an adequate level of activity for its particular condition and to do it without disrupting daily routines. The framework is supported by a software system built for monitoring well-being and physical activity in the context of Smart Cities. The system is composed by: (1) smartphone applications that interact with the end-user for showing possible exercises and walk routes, and that collects some relevant data; (2) a back-office application that collects and presents data obtained from the smartphone applications. The back-office application is designed for health professionals to follow users’ progression over time, to recommend new exercises or to correct less optimal situations. The first tests with a system implementing this framework show that the solution is robust and able to be used in a large scale.",

Method: A prospective and observational study of patients with documented PH (N = 46). Patients completed the WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire during a scheduled routine clinical visit, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic medical records (EMR). In subsequent visits, selected clinical variables were registered to assess disease progression. Results: WHODAS 2.0 scores were indicative of mild to moderate disability for the domains of mobility (22.0 ± 23.2), life activities (23.7 ± 25.5), and participation in society (17.2 ± 15.9), as well as total WHODAS 2.0 score (15.3 ± 15.2). For the domains of cognition (9.1 ± 14.1), self-care (8.3 ± 14.4), and interpersonal relationships (11.7 ± 15.7), scores were lower. Disability scores were, generally, proportional to the PH severity. The main baseline correlates of disability were World Health Organisation (WHO) functional class, fatigue, dyspnoea, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP). Baseline WHODAS 2.0 scores showed significant associations with disease progression. However, this effect was not transversal to all domains, with only a few domains significantly associated with disease progression variables. Conclusions: This PH population shows mild disability, with higher degree of disability in the domains of mobility and life activities. This study is the first one to assess disability in PH using WHODAS 2.0. Further studies should apply this scale to larger PH populations with suitable representations of more severe PH forms.",

The increase in the elderly population leads to the need to promote healthy aging, with autonomy and independence, and preserving the functional capacity. As people get older, injuries and health conditions that impact on their wellbeing must be taken into account, and understanding what is adequate requires specialized knowledge and training. If people are left alone deciding their own activity level, they can be too aggressive and aggravate their injuries, create new ones and refrain themselves in exercising more, or too conservative and in the long run they will have an activity level under their potential and below what is recommended. In this paper we present SmartWalk, a project that aims to create a monitoring system of wellbeing and physical activity in the context of Smart Cities. The project is more than a smartphone application, as it will have health professionals operating the system and will take into consideration contextual and user specific information. The service is about helping people to have the best possible activity level, and do so without disrupting their routines.",

Thus, improving the levels of physical activity is of paramount importance, but it requires the use of low-cost resources that facilitate universal access without depleting the health system. The high number of apps available constitutes an opportunity, but it also makes it quite difficult for the layperson to select the most appropriate app. Furthermore, the information available in the app stores is often insufficient, lacks quality, and is not evidence based, and the systematic reviews fail to assess app quality using standardized and validated instruments.Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically assess the features, content, and quality of the most popular apps that can be used to measure and, potentially, promote physical activity.Methods: Systematic searches were conducted on Apple App Store, Google Play, and Windows Phone Store between December 2017 and January 2018. Apps were included if their primary objective was to assess the aspects of physical activity, if they had a user rating of at least 4, if their number of ratings was ≥100, and if they were free. Apps meeting these criteria were independently assessed by two reviewers regarding their general and technical information, aspects of physical activity, presence of behavioral change techniques, and quality. Data were analyzed using means and SDs or frequencies and percentages.Results: Of 51 apps included, none specified the age of the target group and only one mentioned the involvement of health professionals. Most apps offered the possibility to work in background (n=50) and allowed data sharing (n=40). Regarding physical activity, most apps measured steps and distance (n=11) or steps, distance, and time (n=17). Only 18 apps, all of which measured number of steps, followed the guidelines on recommendations for physical activity. On average, 5.5 (SD 1.8) behavioral change techniques were identified per app; the most frequently used techniques were “provide feedback on performance” (n=50) and “prompt self-monitoring of behavior” (n=50). The overall quality score was 3.88 (SD 0.34).Conclusions: Although the overall quality of the apps was moderate, the quality of their content, particularly the use of international guidelines on physical activity, should be improved. Additionally, a more in-depth assessment of apps should be performed before releasing them for public use, particularly regarding their reliability and validity.",

Considering the need for articulation of the care networks based on the community, the domain knowledge of professionals that work directly with the population should be considered in the development of information services that support the implementation of electronic social records. This paper presents the development of personas and scenarios used to support the technological development process and for the technical specification of the information services of an electronic social record platform called the Social Cooperation for Integrated Assisted Living (SOCIAL) platform. The personas and scenarios were defined based on 15 face-to-face interviews with relevant stakeholders and validated in a focus group with other nine stakeholders. Five personas and three scenarios were defined and are currently being used to guide the development process of the SOCIAL platform. Because of the great conceptual variability found during the interviews, the relevant concepts were normalized and mapped to the personas and scenarios previously defined and a glossary was created to facilitate communication within stakeholders and development team.",

Introduction Recent technological developments aiming to improve the quality of health care and its operational efficiency made possible innovative ehealth applications that provide the opportunity for personalized care in residential environments1. Concerning older adults, health conditions are influenced by a wide range of factors that can hinder the autonomy and independence of the individuals2. Individuals in the border of dependency need care and assistance services due to the impossibility to perform activities of daily living (e.g. tasks at home, mobility, recreation or safety). In the past, this support was mainly provided by informal caregivers. However, the lifestyle changes, the decline of the number of family elements, and the increasing participation of the women in the labor market have had a profound impact on the availability of informal caregivers. Thus, the care networks composed by formal caregivers and informal caregivers to support domestic activities, personal care, nursing care, social care, administrative tasks or transporting (i.e. the care networks of community-dwelling older adults) have an increasing importance3. However, there are significant technological differences between the health sector and the social sector, which makes it very difficult in the latter to communicate across professional, organizational and jurisdictional boundaries and, consequently, to access essential information, particularly for the care of vulnerable older adults4,5. In fact, mechanisms to register, access and share the required information are non-existent or inferior to those available for health care networks. Moreover, existing open platforms6, such as the Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies (SMART)7,8, do not consider the specificities of the information required for the social care provision (e.g. electronic social records9). This paper presents the project Social Cooperation for Integrated Assisted Living (SOCIAL). The SOCIAL project aims to develop a platform of information core services able to provide substitutable applications to support the care and assistance of community-dwelling older adults. In addition to this introductory section, the present paper comprises five more sections: Motivation and Background, Methods, Requirements, High-Level Architecture, and Conclusion. 2. Motivation and Background As people live longer, there is an increase of chronic conditions requiring long-term care, which pressures the health care and social care systems. Namely, the shift away from institutional to community care has promoted the development of ehealth solutions and therefore different technologies are being considered to support patients with chronic conditions in their residential environments10,11. Particularly, mobile and wearable personal health devices able to continuously monitor various physiological parameters in out-hospital conditions are now available due to remarkable advances on sensing technology12. Moreover, the use of personal health devices to monitor physiological parameters and daily activities might help to optimize assistance and to properly react to emergencies (e.g. fall detection systems)12,13. The above-mentioned shift away from institutional to community care also increases the complexity the health care services, since multiple service providers are responsible for the care provision to individuals5. Therefore, modern health and social care are characterized by shared procedures between different organizations and a trend towards community care, including, in addition to health care provision, by medical and nursing staff, social care provision, by social care staff, or home assistance services such as cleaning and provision of meals14. The complexity of individual situations requires collaboration between professionals belonging to different organizations, which hinder the care coordination (e.g. opportunities to meet and discuss mutual patients)14. Informal caregivers, formal health and social caregivers, and assistance providers must work as a team with common goals to deliver a coordinated response to individualâ€™s needs9,15. However, the geographic dispersion of the organizations promotes the fragmentation of care14 and, considering the different nature of the organizations, there are various organizational or cultural factors that difficult the care integration (e.g. in cultural terms, social caregivers are usually faced, and often themselves accept it very naturally, as the lower hierarchical level of the whole line of formal care)16. Furthermore, informal care is also undervalued. The health and social care divide9 can also explain the technological differences between health care institutions and social care institutions. In fact, despite the impressive developments of information services to support health Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 138 (2018) 197â€“202 1992 Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 1.

Namely, the shift away from institutional to community care has promoted the development of ehealth solutions and therefore different technologies are being considered to support patients with chronic conditions in their residential environments10,11.

The above-mentioned shift away from institutional to community care also increases the complexity the health care services, since multiple service providers are responsible for the care provision to individuals5. Therefore, modern health and social care are characterized by shared procedures between different organizations and a trend towards community care, including, in addition to health care provision, by medical and nursing staff, social care provision, by social care staff, or home assistance services such as cleaning and provision of meals14. The complexity of individual situations requires collaboration between professionals belonging to different organizations, which hinder the care coordination (e.g. opportunities to meet and discuss mutual patients)14. Informal caregivers, formal health and social caregivers, and assistance providers must work as a team with common goals to deliver a coordinated response to individualâ€™s needs9,15.

Furthermore, informal care is also undervalued. The health and social care divide9 can also explain the technological differences between health care institutions and social care institutions. In fact, despite the impressive developments of information services to support health Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 care provision, social care information services have been designed to serve bureaucracy rather than to support the professional practice or to improve the services provision, and the potential users are not involved in the design process17. Consequently, the access and sharing of the care receiver information can often prove difficult4,18. Thus, despite the number of scientific articles reporting the interoperability between information systems that support clinical practice, there are few articles reporting solutions related to the interoperability between clinical and social records19,20. Therefore, developing and implementing applications to support a shared data set between healthcare and social care and assistance sectors is a difficult, slow and gradual process. In fact, although organizations may be able to identify and express their goals, there are numerous possible reasons to hinder the technological evolution, namely low level of computer literacy, fear of failure, fear of loss of autonomy or fear of additional workload, concerns about the impact on human resources, or concerns about information confidentiality5. 3. Methods In methodological terms, the SOCIAL project is following an approach that presupposes iterative cycles of successive refinements, in which stakeholderâ€™s representatives are invited to participate in partial validations. The methods used to identify functional and non-functional requirements were participatory observations, interviews and focus groups. Based on the collected information several personas and scenarios were developed, considering different needs (e.g. active, autonomous and independent older adults or older adults with low level of autonomy and independence). The personas and scenarios that were defined emphasized important intersection points between different care providers and allow a holistic view of the entire care process (e.g. coordination of planned activities, important health events or specific changes in home care provision). Afterwards, from the preliminary list of requirements and a set of significant use cases, the generic architecture of the SOCIAL platform was designed, and prototypes of relevant applications were specified and are being implemented. The validation of these prototypes by stakeholderâ€™s representatives together with the development of new use cases allow the refinement of the architecture and respective applications. This will be the basis for a new cycle of refinement and validation. In the end, a consolidated version of the SOCIAL platform and respective applications will be evaluated in a real conditions pilot study. 4. Requirements A broad range of non-functional requirement were considered for the development of the SOCIAL platform: ï‚· Ethical and regulatory requirements, including the applicable regulations to guarantee inviolability and transparency of the information being gathered (e.g. EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals). ï‚· Quality related requirements, such as the quality of the applications (e.g. user experience, availability, accessibility, integrity, performance, reliability, security, and regulatory compliance). ï‚· Interoperability mechanisms to ensure continuity of care independently of the nature of the care and assistance services. ï‚· Conformance to international standards. ï‚· Extensibility, reusability, configurability, flexibility, and maintainability to facilitate the deployment of new applications. In terms of functional requirements, the SOCIAL platform should include applications to support assisted persons21. Assisted persons might be from active older adults that need sporadic assistance services to vulnerable individuals, with lack of autonomy and independence. To guarantee the provision of care and assistance services to assisted persons, who are themselves special members of the community, different types of interacting entities constitute a care and assistance community: ï‚· Public and private health care institutions delivering care services in a systematic way to individuals, families and communities. 200 Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 138 (2018) 197â€“202 4 Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 ï‚· Institutions providing social services to the assisted persons, either in their homes (i.e. home care) or in care homes, including day centers, retirement residences or geriatric centers. ï‚· Entities providing life assistance services in the assisted personâ€™s own home. ï‚· Caregivers that interact with the assisted person to provide health care, social care, or assistance services (e.g. help with daily tasks such as meal preparation, medication reminders, laundry, light housekeeping, shopping, and companionship). They can be divided into formal and informal caregivers. Formal caregivers are paid for being involved in service provision (e.g. service personnel working for service providers) or are otherwise involved professionally (e.g. skilled volunteers with social commitment). On the other hand, informal caregivers are people from each assisted personâ€™s personal network, such as relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, who do not receive any financial reimbursement for provision of care and assistance to the assisted person. ï‚· Assistance providers addressing less tangible values such as participation (e.g. to promote, in a comprehensive way, the possibility of the technologies to facilitate social, religious, civic and political participation of assisted persons). ï‚· Information providers that create information, educational or entertainment services to be delivered to the assisted person. ï‚· Transport providers, including personal transportation or delivery of goods at home. ï‚· Supportive stakeholders, including authorities and supporters dealing with socio-economical and legal context of care provision. Their involvement is fundamental to ensure funding for the services provision, and with drawing the legal framework in which service provision can reach the target public. Three major groups should be considered within the authorities and supporterâ€™s stakeholder list: legislative and public welfare organizations at local, regional, national and European level (e.g. regional and national agencies working for the welfare and health care systems, policy-makers, or authorities in general), financial bodies (e.g. public national and health social care service, regional and local authorities, and private health insurance companies), and supporting organizations such as private organizations that, in accordance with their principles of social responsibility, provide programs of patronage. Some organizations can be considered in different classes. This is the case of the municipalities that establish guidelines and provide financing (i.e. supportive stakeholder), but, because of recent years policies, also provide direct care services22. The SOCIAL platform intends to provide robust core information services to allow the development and deployment of a broad range of mobile and web applications, including: ï‚· Common applications, such as: registration and self-registration on the platform; insertion and editing of registered data (e.g. demographic data); notifications and alerts of relevant information, such as tasks to be performed or enrolled activities; registration of actions that contribute to the individualâ€™s care plans (e.g. registration of personal tasks or actions performed by formal and informal caregivers); assessment (e.g. for the improvement of the whole support process); or information sharing among both assisted persons and care providers with differentiated access but without data replication. ï‚· Assisted persons applications, such as: requests for assistance (i.e. description of a specific situation and identification of the assisted person, as well as an informal caregiver to provide this assistance, such as a family member or neighbour); individual care plans, including the management of daily and tasks (e.g. meal times, planned physical activity, dates and times of external consultations or sporadic needs, among others); consultation and enrolment in programs being proposed and adapted to the needs of the assisted persons (e.g. to express preference for suggested care plans and activities or obtain information for a possible future enrolment); or integration of information of personal health devices ( e.g. monitoring of medication intake or monitoring of physiological parameters, activities or behaviours). ï‚· Caregiver applications, such as: association of a caregiver to an assisted person; update the assisted person profile; management of care plans and tasks; report of occurrences, requests for assistance; or participation in programs and activities. ï‚· Care management applications, such as: administrative management of assisted persons and care providers; management of requests for assistance; allocation of human and material resources; management of programs Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 138 (2018) 197â€“202 201 Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5 and activities; or referral, when needed to external organizations with a greater specialty in the provision of resources that meet specific situations and conditions. Still at the level of care management functions, it should be noted the importance of secondary use of information. Therefore, information consolidation mechanisms (e.g. big data) are planned, namely to provide information to authorities responsible for supervising the provision of care and assistance services or for planning new policies and initiatives. 5. High-Level Architecture The architecture of the SOCIAL platform is based on a services-oriented approach (SOA), in order to allow the separation of business rules from the applications and technology that interpret them. The architecture was divided into four layers: ï‚· The application layer comprises the set of the above-mentioned web and mobile applications to fulfil the needs of the stakeholders of the SOCIAL platform and interfaces to integrate external applications according to established standards (e.g. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources from the Health Level Seven framework, Representational State Transfer or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). ï‚· The business layer aggregates several components: Information Gateway (i.e. validation, storage, reconstitution and search of information directly related to the assisted persons), Data Analysis and Reporting (i.e. consolidation of information for secondary use), Authorization and Authentication (i.e. general mechanisms to control access to SOCIAL platform), Workflow Engine (i.e. management and configuration of workflows that must be performed according to previously defined and agreed protocols), Logging and Auditing (i.e. access and audit logging), or Complex Event Processing (i.e. the management of personal health devices and the processing of the information they generate). ï‚· The Data Access layer (i.e. the abstraction of the different databases of the Data layer). The Data layer is divided into a set of information silos: information of the assisted persons, subdivided into demographic, clinical and social with distinct infrastructures, both in logical and physical terms, to safeguard the privacy of the assisted persons; authentication and authorization; audit; terminology, versioning; anonymized data for secondary use; stream data from personal health devices; and mappings between different information silos. Moreover, the Data layer is also able to accommodate data from external services, including clinical systems, territory and regional repositories or foundations infrastructures (e.g. health care identifiers, â€œyellow pagesâ€� style search of health care providers and organizations, or location of services for delivering electronic messages, digital credentials, or terminology references sets). 6. Conclusion The aims and requirements of the SOCIAL platform, as well as its high-level architecture were presented in this paper. The development approach is based on iterative cycles of successive refinements that include participatory observations, interviews, and the proposal of several personas and scenarios considering different needs and requirements, which were validated by a focus group. First prototypes of key applications are now being assessed by older adults, institutions and caregivers. This assessment will be used to refine the functional requirements of the SOCIAL platform and applications, which will be the basis of a new development cycle. A real conditions pilot study is planned to start during the last trimester of 2018. 202 Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 138 (2018) 197â€“202 6 Manuel Sousa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 Acknowledgments This work was supported by Sistema de Incentivos Ã InvestigaÃ§Ã£o e Desenvolvimento TecnolÃ³gico (SI I&DT) of the Programa Portugal 2020, through Programa Operacional Competitividade e InternacionalizaÃ§Ã£o and/or Programa Operacional do Centro do FEDER - Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, under Social Cooperation for Integrated Assisted Living (SOCIAL), project number 017861.

Introduction Currently there are many different information systems in clinical environment, as well as multiple imaging modalities equipmentâ€™s from different manufacturers, that produce huge amounts of data [1]. In medical imaging arena, the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) has been used in multiple scenarios [2,3,4] including Content Base Image Retrieve initiatives [5]. On the other hand, DICOM metadata stored in medical image repositories can be a valuable source of information for professional practice characterization and can be used in efficiency metrics for productivity assessment [6], or to provide data for different initiatives as is the case of the development of medical imaging performance indicators [7,8] or biomedical research [9]. However, the enormous amount of data, as well as the diversity of informational environments, poses some difficulties to the access, indexing and usage of DICOM metadata [10,11], which turns relevant the development of tools and methods for the extraction, processing, delivery and analyses of large volumes of DICOM metadata. In this scenario, the development of tools like Dicoogle [12] can provide important assets. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to identify the potentialities and challenges associated to the indexing and analyses of the information contained in the DICOM header belonging to medical imaging studies, stored in Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) of different healthcare facilities. For that the Dicoogle application was used. 2. Background The interest in the potential of the tremendous amount of information that is produced on a daily basis in the hospital environment is not new. The reasons for this interest have been changing over time, much due to a constant healthcare differentiation. Along with the information from Electronic Health Records (EHR), multidimensional data from genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic measurements, but also from medical imaging modalities has been contributing to the Big Data phenomenon [13]. The management of large volumes of information is useful if good practices are adopted when using new technologies according to quality standards, associated with interoperable storage strategies and promoting the adoption of advanced computing solutions for data analyses [14]. Regarding the EHR data, these can be used for different purposes. However, the data extraction from EHR systems to be used in the scope of clinical and translational research is not a trivial process, which has promoted the development of multiple strategies and technological solutions over time [15]. Some of these solutions were developed to extract data from medical reports, including unstructured information, often supported in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [16,17]. The use of NLP has been evident in multiple scenarios namely in the identification of cases of cancer [18] or within medical imaging departments [19]. In medical imaging environment, NLP can be useful to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts related to the clinical situation under investigation, namely through data capture from free-text radiology reports [20]. It is also possible the image retrieval based on radiology reports [21] as well as store and retrieve preclinical molecular imaging data stored in PACS [22]. Also in the scope of collecting information stored in PACS, it is possible to index DICOM metadata from scattered and unstructured files [23]. In this context, Dicoogle [24] is a software framework that enables developers and researchers to quickly prototype and deploy new functionality taking advantage of the embedded DICOM services. It allows the realization of two types of data indexing: a hierarchical content indexing of the DICOM metadata (patient, study, series, image) and a text content indexing (free text query). The results of the indexing process are stored in a index file, on which the user can perform queries and extract the DICOM metadata of interest. The development of new methods for access, extraction and analysis of DICOM metadata [12,25], namely of DICOM metadata belonging to medical imaging studies stored in multiple PACS [26], can be a complementary strategy to characterize medical imaging department practices, namely the medical imaging procedures [27].

Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 3 3. Materials and Methods A secondary analysis was performed on the results of a set of research studies supported on the indexing of DICOM metadata from the PACS of different healthcare facilities, using the Dicoogle application as a DICOM metadata indexing tool. The analysis was made according to two perspectives: i) advantages of indexing and analyzing DICOM metadata from PACS; and ii) challenges associated to the indexing and managing of large volumes of DICOM metadata. 4. Results Eight research studies reporting the indexing of DICOM metadata from the PACS of four different healthcare facilities were analyzed [10,11,26,27,28,29,30,31]. The number of healthcare facilities covered by the studies varied between one [28] and four [11]. The metadata indexing strategies began with the installation of Dicoogle on a personal computer [26,27,28,30] or on virtual machines belonging to the healthcare facilities [10,11,27,31]. Regarding indexed metadata volume, it ranged between 250 GB [28] and 34.2 TB [11], which had an impact on indexing time, ranging from 16.5h [28] to 86 days [11]. Some of the studies characterize comparatively the DICOM metadata stored in two PACS [26,30]. Regarding the amount of data used, the studies were supported in all metadata resulted from the indexing process [10,11,29,26,28], or in a subset of the initial DICOM metadata sample, which was defined according to the objectives of each study [28,30,31]. For example, in [31], from an initial sample of 1274927 images, only 26233 images were selected and in [30], from an initial sample of 69041 patients with 210582 studies and 351248 images, a final sample of 1757 patients was selected and the metadata of 2047 studies and 8087 images were analyzed. 4.1. Advantages Associated to the Indexation and Analysis of DICOM Metadata from PACS Regarding the possibility of characterizing medical imaging stakeholders and population using DICOM metadata, it is possible to identify patients and make their characterization by age and gender [27,28,31] in different imaging modalities [28,30,31] but also to characterize healthcare provision [26,29]. The possibility of identifying different medical imaging stakeholders can be significant for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the procedures. The exchange of information between doctors and other professionals as well as with the patients presupposes that they are correctly identified, namely to clarify the clinical situation of triggers the performance of imaging procedures. On the other hand, the knowledge of the population with studies performed, may be useful for the identification of the population predisposition to a particular pathology, or clinical situation, according to their age, gender or clinical history. Concerning the individual and population exposure characterization, the DICOM metadata indexed from PACS seems to allow the exposure analysis in multiple scenarios. In a patient-oriented approach, it is possible to characterize the patientÂ´s radiation exposure history [27] and to identify situations representing inappropriate exposure [28,30,31]. In fact, knowledge of the history of exposures to ionizing radiation may be useful for the definition of other strategies that do not involve the enhancement of studies of modalities that do not require ionizing radiation (e.g., ultrasound or magnetic resonance studies). In a population-orientation approach, it is possible to characterize population with imaging studies performed in different modalities [28,26] and to analyze the average number of imaging studies performed on the patients, age groups and modalities [27,30].Considering the analysis of the material and human resources, it seems to be possible the identification of the professionals who carry out the imaging studies [29], the identification of the studies carried out on a specific equipment [26,30], and the identification of the imaging studies carried out on different modalities and over time [10,26,28,30], making possible the professional practice analysis and being able to contribute to human and material resources usage optimization. In terms of the analysis of performance and optimization, it seems possible to identify contributions for the improvement of professional practice, regarding the optimization of resource utilization [25] [15], procedures [28,30,31] and individual and population radiation protection [27]. 206 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 138 (2018) 203â€“2084 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000â€“000 On the other hand, the analysis of the DICOM metadata can contribute to a better knowledge of the information acquisition and storage needs, which can contribute to a better PACS information management, as well as a better knowledge of all the infrastructure requirements to support the storage of the enormous amount of information produced by medical imaging modalities in daily practice [10], particularly in the context of modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. 4.2. Challenges Associated with Indexing and Managing Large Volumes of Metadata The use of Dicoogle in a clinical setting does not appear to promote limitations in PACS usage during daily activity. At two healthcare facilities, the indexing of metadata was achieved without significant constraints, even in situations where the PACS supplier gave no cooperation [25]. This scenario has demonstrated in a paradigmatic way the potentialities and advantages of indexing metadata for DICOM data mining initiatives. The possibility of accessing DICOM metadata without resorting to the equipment and information systems manufacturers, and without altering the stored data, can be an advantage for the analysis of the metadata stored in different PACS, regardless of their geographic location. In addition, the existence of information systems and equipment from multiple manufacturers did not cause constraints on access and indexing of metadata [28]. Depending on the included research studies, large amounts of metadata were indexed, from 265 GB [28] to 34.2 TB [11]. As a result of the indexing of PACS with different dimensions, large index files [10,11], associated with indexing times from 16,5h [28] to 86 to 86 days, were produced [11]. However, the adoption of efficient storage, merging, and information extraction strategies mitigated the computational and storage limitations associated with the management of large amounts of data. In some of the included research studies, it was necessary to merge the information that results from the indexing of the metadata stored on different disks that are part of the PACS [10,11,26], namely using a spinoff application of the Dicoogle, which allowed the metadata aggregation and normalization [11]. Regarding the quality of the metadata, they seem to be very dependent on the DICOM attributes available in different medical imaging modalities [10], as well as their percentage of use [10,28,29]. For example, the number of DICOM attributes publicly available for the characterization of medical imaging stakeholders (e.g. institution, manufacturer, or healthcare professionals) can range from 20 in Computed Radiography to ten in the Radio Fluoroscopy modality [29]. This fact may become limiting to the need for healthcare delivery, namely in the communication between different stakeholders (e.g., between different physicians and health professionals and patients) as well as to define the best imaging strategy to clarify the clinical problem to be resolved. On the other hand, some DICOM attributes although used, have unexpected values, namely related to the Patient ID and Referring Physician Name DICOM attributes [28,29], or related to the Institution Name DICOM attribute. Therefore, the DICOM attributes that characterize the patients, or the healthcare professionals have different completion levels [10,29]. 5. Conclusion The research studies analyzed revealed the potential for the use of DICOM metadata, but also challenges associated with indexing and managing large volumes of metadata, namely identification of medical imaging stakeholders, computational needs and information management, quality of DICOM metadata, analyses of individual and population exposure and the use of human and material resources. Furthermore, it was possible to adopt efficient mechanisms to acquire and process the DICOM metadata without impact in the performance of the PACS during daily activities. However, there are constrains in terms of the quality of the available DICOM metadata. The possibility of acquiring information on imaging studies carried out on a population, in a way that does not constrain the provision of health care, can be a valuable asset for the medical imaging practice continuous improvement. On the other hand, the possibility of DICOM metadata statistical analysis makes its use feasible and potentially advantageous in multiple scenarios, such as in the definition of patient-centered care strategies, but also in medical translational and multidimensional research.

In the study reported in the present paper, the authors performed a secondary analysis on the results of research studies supported on the indexing of DICOM metadata from Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) of different healthcare facilities. The analysis was made according to two perspectives: i) advantages of indexing and analyzing DICOM metadata from the PACS of different healthcare facilities; and ii) challenges associated to the indexing and managing of large volumes of DICOM metadata. The research studies being analyzed revealed the potential for the use of DICOM metadata by aggregating and consolidating huge amounts of DICOM metadata to characterize healthcare provision.

This study aims to describe how pain at multiple body sites is associated after controlling for other predictive factors such as age, sex, sleeping hours, time spent in physical activity, and time spent in screening based activities in adolescents aged 13 to 19 years. Summary of Background Data. The prevalence of multisite pain in adolescents is high, but studies investigating the patterns of association between painful body sites are scarce. Methods. Pain for the last 3 months was assessed using Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. In addition, data on time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity, sleeping, and in screen based activities were also assessed. Results. In univariable analysis of associations, there is a significant association between most painful body sites (odds ratio [OR\\ between 1.52 and 3.73, P<0.05). After controlling for age, sex, physical activity, sleep and screen time, most of the previous associations remain significant (OR between 1.50 and 3.07, P<0.05). Conclusion. This study's results seem to suggest that pain at one body site is more important in determining multiple painful body sites than demographic or lifestyle factors. Longitudinal studies exploring the association and chronology of multisite pain are needed.",

All rights reservedFor the electronic health record (EHR) to be considered a true clinical decision support system, it must be possible to access and integrate the patients’ clinical information collected throughout their lives, guaranteeing up-to-date, safe and congruent information, immediately accessible at the place of care. Moreover, there is a considerable capacity to develop and manufacture personal health devices (PHD) highly integrated and miniaturized, which facilitate the home monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Since the information collected by PHD should be integrated in existing EHR, interoperability is an essential requirement of eHealth to allow the integration of care into a diversity of settings and care providers. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify and analyse references related to the topic of home monitoring that reveal an explicit concern with interoperability requirements. Regarding the results and considering the initial 2778 references, only 2% (61 references) explicitly mentioned interoperability issues and, within these 61 references, only eight reported end-to-end solutions that can be integrated and usable in care service provision. Therefore, the issue of interoperability of PHD, both semantic and technological, a priority for the establishment of a remote patient monitoring solution market, is discussed in this review.",

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) promotes the development of technological solutions that might have a key role in not only the optimization of support services for older adults but also in the mitigation of their disabilities. This article presents a systematic literature review of how the impact of AAL technologies, products and services is being assessed in terms of its health-related outcomes. The main objective of this article is to contribute to the understanding of how state-of-the-art AAL solutions might influence the health conditions of older adults. The method used to conduct this systematic literature review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The results show that the reviewed articles report not only the use of technological assessment instruments but also instruments to measure health-related outcomes such as quality of life.",

One of the important factors for the prescription of a thromboprophylaxis is the determination of the risk of thromboembolism, which can be implemented in several ways, using different methodologies, namely by using risk scales. In this work, developed in the Hospital Center of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal, we describe the development and implementation of an application with two scales for the assessment and stratification of the risk of thromboembolism, to be applied in hospitalized patients (Caprini scale) and in patients in ambulatory surgery (scale recommended by the Portuguese Ambulatory Surgery Association). The application was integrated into the hospital electronic health record system (SClínico).",

Nevertheless, pain at different body sites is likely to be of different nature. Therefore, this study aims to explore and compare the association between time spent in self-reported physical activity, in screen based activities and sleeping and i) pain presence in the last 7-days for 9 different body sites; ii) pain intensity at 9 different body sites and iii) global disability. Methods: Nine hundred sixty nine students completed a questionnaire on pain, time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity, screen based time watching TV/DVD, playing, using mobile phones and computers and sleeping hours. Univariate and multivariate associations between pain presence, pain intensity and disability and physical activity, screen based time and sleeping hours were investigated. Results: Pain presence: sleeping remained in the multivariable model for the neck, mid back, wrists, knees and ankles/feet (OR 1.17 to 2.11); moderate physical activity remained in the multivariate model for the neck, shoulders, wrists, hips and ankles/feet (OR 1.06 to 1.08); vigorous physical activity remained in the multivariate model for mid back, knees and ankles/feet (OR 1.05 to 1.09) and screen time remained in the multivariate model for the low back (OR = 2.34. Pain intensity: screen time and moderate physical activity remained in the multivariable model for pain intensity at the neck, mid back, low back, shoulder, knees and ankles/feet (Rp2 0.02 to 0.04) and at the wrists (Rp2 = 0.04), respectively. Disability showed no association with sleeping, screen time or physical activity. Conclusions: This study suggests both similarities and differences in the patterns of association between time spent in physical activity, sleeping and in screen based activities and pain presence at 8 different body sites. In addition, they also suggest that the factors associated with the presence of pain, pain intensity and pain associated disability are different.",

This procedure was applied to the metadata held by 19 storage units of a PACS of a Portuguese hospital centre composed by three branches. In total, more than 36 million images, from more than ten modalities were collected. The merging and reconciliation procedure have proven to be robust and efficient. This shows that it is possible to merge the metadata collected from multiple PACS into a single unified view, preserving the relation between patients, studies, and images, which is essential for large-scale analyses of medical imaging repositories from multiple institutions.",

There is a need of redirecting care provision to the citizen’s natural environment, namely considering the opportunities offered by information and communication technologies. For this purpose the authors surveyed projects already implemented in Portugal, within the Portuguese National Health Service, related to home monitoring, in order to make a critical analysis of the state of the art of ongoing projects. In this study, the authors identified four pilot experiences of home monitoring, all targeted at chronic disease. In spite of some results of these experiments are already known, there is a shortage of available information and scientific evidence, both about the implementation processes themselves and about their clinical, technical and economic evaluation, which, in the opinion of the authors, also hinders their assessment and dissemination.",

Healthy Lifestyles Accordingly the literature, mHealth has been widely used to promote healthy lifestyles, including physical activity, nutrition, and weight management or health education5-11. 2.1.1. Physical Activity Physical activity affects health conditions and the current recommendations advice older adults to perform regular physical activity12.

In particular, smartphones are being considered to promote physical activity with the support of strategies that typically involve â€™pushingâ€™ the participants with periodic prompts (e.g. messages) from a central source5,6, physical activity measures and remote feedback7. When reported as an outcome, physical activity is being measured through validated questionnaires (e.g. the Short Questionnaire Assessing Health-enhancing - SQUASH, the Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire, and the comprehensive evaluation of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire), or quantitative measures. Examples of quantitative measures are steps per day or minutes of weekly exercise that can be performed by different types of devices, namely pedometers or accelerometers6. 2.1.2. Nutrition and Weight Management There are several mHealth applications able to capture dietary intake to promote self-monitoring adherence11, which can be divided into: i) applications that allow participants to select food and portion size; ii) application that process food photograph taken by the users; and iii) applications supporting questionnaires such as the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) or the MEDFICTS score. Smartphones present several advantages when compared to desktop computers or notebooks and, in particular, they can be used to record individual dietary intake just after consumption11. This can be done by self-administered quantitative questionnaires to record the food intake (e.g. by scrolling through a list of foods or by selecting a food group and then a specific food item), or by taking photos. Concerning weight management, remote interventions are being delivered using smartphone applications, or even more traditional methods, such as telephone calls5,9. The interventions can be delivered to groups or individuals, and they can involve one-off or ongoing interactions between the implementer and the participants that include: counselling and advice, self-directed and prescribed exercises, home-based and facility based exercises, or motivational support.

Health Education Information technologies, in general, and mobile technologies, in particular, offer a medium to be used by the public, patients, and health professionals to communicate about health issues. This is a possibility of potentially improving health outcomes, through collaboration and social interaction mechanisms (e.g. information exchange for promoting knowledge, self-management, perceived health services utilization or perceived social support), which brings a new dimension to health care for a wide range of individuals. The literature reports the use of mHealth for citizensâ€™ education9,10, covering a diverse population in terms of age, sex, education level, health status and healthcare intervention or disease state, and making use of different solutions, including social media (e.g. wiki, YouTube, Facebook, blogs, twitter and Myspace10) or serious games. These solutions may facilitate immediate, intermediate and long-term health-related outcomes in older adults by providing and exchanging information, and by promoting self-management. Therefore, they facilitate the answers to medical questions, promote the dialogue, allow the collection of data on participantsâ€™ experiences, and might increase accessibility, widen access, support public health surveillance, and inform health policies10. 2.2. Home Safety The literature reports both several exploratory, observational or feasibility studies and randomized controlled trials aimed to evaluate the impact of mobile technologies together with personal alarms, home automation systems, and smart technologies (e.g. bed sensors, kitchen sensors, motion sensors or fall detection sensors) to help older adults to overcome emergency situations, including falls detection13. Older adults reported improved safety, independence and confidence, particularly when real-time monitoring devices are connected to response systems13. Although there is still the lack of robust evidence in the scientific literature, it is possible to infer that mHealth applications aimed at predicting, monitoring and preventing should consider intrinsic factors related to older attitudes around control, independence and perceived requirements for safety. This is important for participantsâ€™ motivation to use and continue using technological solutions (e.g. qualitative research shows that participants were found to reject technology, as they did not want their home to look like a hospital)14. 2.3. Loneliness and Social Isolation Loneliness is a subjective concept related to a perceived absence or loss of companionship, while social isolation concerns the lack of structural and functional social support and can be either voluntary or involuntary15. In turn, loneliness is always involuntary15. Researchers report that the impact of social relationships on the risk of mortality is comparable with major, well-established risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and exceeds that of physical inactivity and obesity15. Both smartphones applications and telephone befriending interventions can consistently affect positively social support, social connectedness, and social isolation of older adults16. In particular, mobile applications facilitate several mechanisms, including connecting to the outside world (e.g. family members, especially grandchildren, friends, former colleagues or new contacts of shared interests) and, most important, boosts self-confidence and empowerment which trigger positive feelings, namely in terms of control over life and/or life satisfaction16. 2.4. Health Care Several chronic medical conditions affect the quality of life of older adults. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to optimize the care and the required interventions, namely by providing home monitoring or by promoting the compliance of self-care. Different mHealth applications are being used to minimize the impact of pathologies with a relevant prevalence among older adults, namely diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. Diabetes requires constant monitoring of the glucose levels and patient adherence to best practice recommendations, engagement and participation, congestive heart failure has a high rate of hospital readmission17, key aspects of the natural history of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are episodes of acute exacerbations18, 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000â€“000 and patients undergoing cancer treatment may experience many undesirable side effects that can negatively affect their quality of life. 2.4.1. Diabetes Concerning diabetes, mHealth applications might provide a variety of functions to support older patients, both in terms of home monitoring, self-management or patient adherence (e.g. self-monitoring blood glucose recording, medication compliance, prandial insulin dose calculators, daily eating behaviors, physical activity or integrated communication between patients and healthcare providers)19-21. The main health-related outcome when applying mHealth to monitor older adults with diabetes is the control of glycaemia by using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as a proxy. However, this aim can be complemented with other health-related outcomes (e.g. health-related quality of life, weight, depression, blood pressure, cholesterol level, triglycemius level, fluctuation index), behavior outcomes (e.g. physical activity), patient self-motivation, patient- clinician communication, medication adherence, and structural outcomes related to care coordination21,22. Moreover, since self-management of diabetes requires patient adherence to best practice recommendations (e.g. glycaemia control, dietary management or physical activity) there has been an increasing interest of self-care applications: self-management and care knowledge, prescribed medication adherence, or behavior outcomes (e.g. diet and healthy eating or physical activity)20-22. In technological terms, the reported mHealth applications are supported by standalone smartphones or smartphones integrating specific devices (e.g. monitoring devices such as glucometers for automatic glucose level upload or pedometers and accelerometers to monitor physical activity) to provide synchronous (e.g. telephone calls or instant messaging) and asynchronous (e.g. electronic mail or bulletin board) communications, electronic practice guidelines, reminder systems, feedback to the patients and automatic patient data transmission by means of monitoring devices (e.g. vital signals or behavior outcomes)19,20,23. 2.4.2. Congestive Heart Failure Heart failure is a common, costly, and potentially fatal condition. The scientific literature reports the use of mHealth applications to support older adults with congestive heart failure24,25. In particular, automatic patient data transmission by means of monitoring devices is being used together with standard telephone calls to allow the assessment of symptoms and vital signs, as well as the transmission of automatic alarms. In terms of clinical outcomes, home monitoring mainly intends to minimize heart failure-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality24 when compared with usual care. However, the use of mHealth applications also affects several secondary outcomes such as self-care behavior (e.g. adherence to prescribed medication, daily weighing or adherence to exercise recommendations). 2.4.3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Remote interventions, including the use of mobile applications designed for smartphones and tablets, appear to be well-accepted for the care of older adults with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly to increase self- care behaviors26,27. For that mHealth applications are usually supported by a wide range of devices to measure and transmit different types of information (e.g. weight, temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, spirometry parameters, symptoms, medication usage or steps in a 6-minutes walking distance). In some cases the automatic data acquisition is complemented by clinical staff using questionnaires in telephone interviews26. Home monitoring, together with efficient mechanisms to provide feedback to the patients, affects hospital or other health care utilization. Moreover, mHealth solutions also affects several secondary outcomes including, among others, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, or physical capacity and effects of dyspnea26,27. 2.4.4. Cancer To mitigate the undesirable side effects that can negatively affect the quality of life of patients with cancer, their empowerment is important. The patientsâ€™ empowerment can contribute to them being autonomous and respected, having knowledge, having psychosocial and behavioral skills, receiving support from community, family, and friends28. In this respect, mHealth applications may support knowledge transmission, including electronic survivorship care plans, and patient-to-patient or patient-to-caregiver communication28.

Discussion and Conclusion The scientific literature reports a considerable number of mHealth applications to support the ageing in place of older adults, namely promoting healthy lifestyles, minimizing loneliness and social exclusion, ensuring home safety, and supporting the care of patients with chronic medical conditions. Therefore, mHealth applications being developed are in line with real needs of older adults. Since physical inactivity and obesity are well-established risk factors with impact on health conditions and mortality, the promotion of healthy lifestyles assumes great importance. Smartphone applications and social media are being considered to behavior changing of older adults, namely in terms of the promotion of physical activity, correct nutrition, weight control and health education5,9-11. On the other hand, loneliness and social exclusion are generally understood as dramatic consequences of the individual ageing process and the response to emergencies in terms of home safety is generally accepted as an important issue for older adults. Concerning the care of older adults with chronic medical conditions, mHealth applications are being used in the home monitoring of patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease19,20,23. Furthermore, in terms of the empowerment of older adults and their informal caregivers, there are mHealth applications targeting several chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer20,22,24-26,28. The portability of smartphones enables participants to have access 24 hours a day, making possible the long-term management and reinforcement of health behaviors through a variety of communications and applications. This can promote the focus of the participants and their adherence to the intervention programs. The comparison between the use of technological solutions and traditional care is reported in a considerable number of articles, including systematic reviews and meta-analysis. A significant number of randomized controlled trials have been performed considering a wide range of health-related outcomes, which depend on the type of the applications being considered. For instance: i) glycaemia control, health-related quality of life or patient adherence to best practice recommendations, including care knowledge, behavior outcomes and adherence to prescribed medication, for patients with diabetes; ii) patientsâ€™ readmission and mortality for patients with congestive heart failure or patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and iii) knowledge, pain, depression, fatigue, anxiety, satisfaction and overall quality of life for patients with cancer. The mHealth applications appear to have positive effects on physical activity behaviors5,6,8, while nutrition applications resulted in better self-monitoring adherence and changes in dietary intake when compared to conventional techniques (e.g. paper records), since there were reported significant net difference in weight between the interventions and control groups5. Furthermore, positive results were also reported when considering outcomes related to knowledge gains, motivation, preventive behavior, medication adherence, and reduced education staff costs for low-risk patients. However, lack of reliability and quality metrics, together with the risks associated with communication harmful or incorrect answers using social media are general concerns10. On the other hand, there were been also pointed positive impacts when mHealth applications were used to surpass social isolation, even if positive effect on social connectedness and social support seemed to be short-term15,16, and safety solutions are assuming an increasing importance. Concerning the care of older adults with chronic medical conditions, it appears that mHealth applications have positive effects with a moderate to large improvements in different outcomes when compared with usual care of patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. One of the problems that emerge from the scientific literature is related to the outcomes being measured. Besides their diversity, it is important to refer that different measurement methods are being applied. This is an important difficulty when aggregating and analyzing data from different trials, which is essential to achieve the statistical and clinical significance that is required to promote the adoption of new services. Despite the huge research effort related to mHealth, there is insufficient evidence that successful interventions have been translated beyond the research setting and been broadly adopted. Potential reasons for this lack of translation should be deeply studied. This means that further research, including large-scale trials with consistent primary and secondary outcomes, and robust analysis about long-term sustainability, are required to allow the full incorporation of mHealth applications to support ageing in place in the daily practice. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000â€“000 References 1.

Discussion and Conclusion The scientific literature reports a considerable number of mHealth applications to support the ageing in place of older adults, namely promoting healthy lifestyles, minimizing loneliness and social exclusion, ensuring home safety, and supporting the care of patients with chronic medical conditions. Therefore, mHealth applications being developed are in line with real needs of older adults. Since physical inactivity and obesity are well-established risk factors with impact on health conditions and mortality, the promotion of healthy lifestyles assumes great importance. Smartphone applications and social media are being considered to behavior changing of older adults, namely in terms of the promotion of physical activity, correct nutrition, weight control and health education5,9-11. On the other hand, loneliness and social exclusion are generally understood as dramatic consequences of the individual ageing process and the response to emergencies in terms of home safety is generally accepted as an important issue for older adults. Concerning the care of older adults with chronic medical conditions, mHealth applications are being used in the home monitoring of patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease19,20,23. Furthermore, in terms of the empowerment of older adults and their informal caregivers, there are mHealth applications targeting several chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer20,22,24-26,28. The portability of smartphones enables participants to have access 24 hours a day, making possible the long-term management and reinforcement of health behaviors through a variety of communications and applications. This can promote the focus of the participants and their adherence to the intervention programs. The comparison between the use of technological solutions and traditional care is reported in a considerable number of articles, including systematic reviews and meta-analysis. A significant number of randomized controlled trials have been performed considering a wide range of health-related outcomes, which depend on the type of the applications being considered. For instance: i) glycaemia control, health-related quality of life or patient adherence to best practice recommendations, including care knowledge, behavior outcomes and adherence to prescribed medication, for patients with diabetes; ii) patientsâ€™ readmission and mortality for patients with congestive heart failure or patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and iii) knowledge, pain, depression, fatigue, anxiety, satisfaction and overall quality of life for patients with cancer. The mHealth applications appear to have positive effects on physical activity behaviors5,6,8, while nutrition applications resulted in better self-monitoring adherence and changes in dietary intake when compared to conventional techniques (e.g. paper records), since there were reported significant net difference in weight between the interventions and control groups5. Furthermore, positive results were also reported when considering outcomes related to knowledge gains, motivation, preventive behavior, medication adherence, and reduced education staff costs for low-risk patients. However, lack of reliability and quality metrics, together with the risks associated with communication harmful or incorrect answers using social media are general concerns10. On the other hand, there were been also pointed positive impacts when mHealth applications were used to surpass social isolation, even if positive effect on social connectedness and social support seemed to be short-term15,16, and safety solutions are assuming an increasing importance. Concerning the care of older adults with chronic medical conditions, it appears that mHealth applications have positive effects with a moderate to large improvements in different outcomes when compared with usual care of patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. One of the problems that emerge from the scientific literature is related to the outcomes being measured. Besides their diversity, it is important to refer that different measurement methods are being applied. This is an important difficulty when aggregating and analyzing data from different trials, which is essential to achieve the statistical and clinical significance that is required to promote the adoption of new services. Despite the huge research effort related to mHealth, there is insufficient evidence that successful interventions have been translated beyond the research setting and been broadly adopted. Potential reasons for this lack of translation should be deeply studied. This means that further research, including large-scale trials with consistent primary and secondary outcomes, and robust analysis about long-term sustainability, are required to allow the full incorporation of mHealth applications to support ageing in place in the daily practice. 6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000â€“000 References 1.

Objective: The study reported in this paper supports the translation, cultural adaptation and validation of the European Portuguese version of the USE. Methods: The study was divided into two phases, the questionnaire translation and adaptation, and the assessment of its validity and reliability. Results: The questionnaire translation resulted in a European Portuguese version of the USE equivalent to the original version in terms of semantic and content, which presents an excellent internal consistency (α = 0.80), highly satisfactory ICC values (ICC = 0.69) and a high and significant correlation (r = −0.84, p < 0.05) with another widely used usability questionnaire, the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire. Conclusion: The European Portuguese version of the USE has adequate psychometric properties that provide adequate evidence of the possibility of using this version in studies to evaluate the self-perceived usability of products or services.",

Methods: The authors analysed the DICOM metadata related to all the imaging studies carried out by all medical imaging modalities and stored in the PACS of a medium size hospital during one year period (i.e. 5153870 images, corresponding to 97612 studies performed on 61256 patients). Results: It was identified a considerable variation in terms of the number of DICOM attributes available for each medical imaging modality (between 10 and 20), and how these attributes are used to characterize medical imaging stakeholders. Conclusion: A better use of DICOM metadata can be achieved, namely to characterize the stakeholders of medical imaging and to promote the communication between them.",

Aim To examine the association between self-reported physical activity and self-reported screen based time. Materials and methods 969 high school students filled in a questionnaire on physical activity and screen based activities. Correlation analysis between time spent in moderate/vigorous physical activities and time spent in screen based activities were performed. Results No association was found between physical activity and time spent watching TV, playing or using computers. A low correlation was found between time using mobile phones and time spent performing moderate physical activities (r =0.09, p <0.05), and vigorous physical activities (r =0.13, p <0.05). Conclusions These findings suggest that screen time is not displacing physical activity. Resumo Objetivos Explorar a associação entre o nível de atividade física e o uso de dispositivos eletrónicos. Materiais e métodos Novecentos e sessenta e nove alunos do secundário preencheram um questionário sobre atividade física e uso de dispositivos eletrónicos. Foi realizada uma análise de correlação entre o tempo despendido em atividade física moderada e intensa e o uso de dispositivos eletrónicos. Resultados Não há correlação entre a atividade física e ver televisão, jogar ou usar computadores. Há uma correlação baixa entre o uso de telemóveis e a atividade física moderada (r=0,09, p<0,05) e vigorosa (r=0,13, p<0,05). Conclusões Estes resultados sugerem que o uso de dispositivos eletrónicos não interfere com a prática da atividade física. Keywords Physical activity Students Screen time Palavras-chave Atividade física Estudantes Dispositivos eletrónicos Introduction The evidence of the benefits of physical activity in maintaining good health and function is unquestionable. For children and adolescents in particular, physical activity has been shown to be associated with positive changes in adiposity, skeletal health, psychological health, improved self-esteem, fewer depressive symptoms 1 and improved cardiorespiratory fitness. 2 Furthermore, it appears to have long term influence on preventing weight gain, obesity, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. 3 Despite the consensual benefits of physical activity across the lifespan, studies have shown a decline in physical activity and an increase in sedentary behaviors during adolescence. 3,4 Increased sedentary behaviors in adolescence have been associated with time spent using electronic devices such as mobile phones, computers, television (i.e., screen time), which in turn, has been shown to be related with hyperactivity/inattention problems, less psychological well-being, less perceived quality of life, 5 obesity 6 and increased pain prevalence. 7 The hypothesis that screen time could displace physical activity has been proposed. 8 However, the evidence on the association between increased screen time and decreased physical activity is conflicting. A few studies have found an inverse association between physical activity and screen time, 9–11 while others have found no association between these factors. 12,13 A recent systematic review identified a negative association between screen time and physical activity/fitness, 11 while a longitudinal study found an inverse but non-substantive association between TV/DVD use and leisure physical activity and no association between computer/game use and leisure physical activity, 14 suggesting that the association might depend on the type of screen based activity. Furthermore, a cross country study 9 suggests that the strength of the association between screen based activities and physical activity depends on gender, country/region, type of screen-based activity and intensity of physical activity. For example, watching television, gaming and using a computer showed different patterns of association with physical activity and the strength of association depended on whether vigorous physical activity or moderate to vigorous physical activity was considered in the analysis. In addition, the strength and direction of the association varied between the South European countries and the Nordic European countries. 9 Therefore, more research is needed in Portugal investigating the potential association between screen time and physical activity for students, in particular whether an association between these variables might depend on the intensity and type of physical activity or type of screen based activity. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether an association exists between self-reported physical activity and self-reported screen based time when considering the intensity (moderate or vigorous) and type (e.g. football, skating, cycling) of the physical activity and the type of screen based activity (watching TV/DVD, playing, using mobile phones and computers) in a sample of Portuguese students from the 7th to the 12th grades. Secondary aims are to characterize the type of physical activities and screen based activities in which students are involved and time per week spent performing them. Methods This study received Ethical approval from the Council of Ethics and Deontology, University of Aveiro. Written consent was obtained from the students or from both the students and their parents if students were younger than 16 years old. Study design and population This study took place in the Council of Ílhavo. This Council spent approximately 1.002.6 euros in the year of 2012 in games and sports, an investment that is higher than the National average (data retrieved from on the 30th of May 2016) and its offer in terms of sports/physical activity includes: swimming, athletics, handball, basket, football, martial arts, ballet, tennis, sailing, surf and canoeing. This Council has 5 schools with the 7th or higher grades. These 5 schools had approximately 1330 students from the 7th to the 12th grade at the time of data collection. All these students were invited to participate in the study. A questionnaire was administered using an Electronic Data Capture (uEDC™) Solution developed for this study. This uEDC™ solution (uedc.iuz.pt) is an Electronic Data Capture solution for the healthcare field, using an information system to collect and process clinical data, involving patients, researchers and healthcare professionals. It enables the setup of a clinical study, in accordance with an established protocol defined by the study promotor. During a physical education lesson each student was given an individual password and login and asked to complete the online questionnaire. Students not at school on the day of data collection were invited to participate on another day. Data were collected between March and June 2014. Measures Demographic data Students were asked to enter data on sex, age and school year. Physical activity Students were asked whether: (1) they participated regularly in the physical education classes; (2) they participated in moderate physical activities other than the physical education classes; and whether (3) they participated in vigorous physical activities other than the physical education classes. Those reporting to participate in moderate or vigorous physical activity had to answer three additional questions related to: type of activity, number of days per week (1–7) and mean duration of each activity per session (minimum 10min). These questions were adapted from Lang. 15 Response options for the moderate physical activities question were: walking to school, walking in general (other than to school), cycling, skating, roller skating, others. Response options for the vigorous physical activities question were: handball, running, martial arts, basket, ballet, football, gymnastics, rowing, swimming, volleyball or other. These lists of activities were based in published guidelines. 16–18 Moderate and vigorous physical activities were described in terms of number of activities, type of activities and mean duration of activities per week. Total time of moderate and vigorous physical activity per week was computed multiplying the daily amount of time spent in each activity by its weekly frequency (i.e. number of days per week) and then adding the individual time per week for all activities reported by the same participant. Total time of moderate and vigorous physical activity was used to calculate the number and percentage of participants reporting at least 420min of activity per week as recommend in international guidelines of physical activity for health of those aged 5–17 years old (at least 60min of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily). 19 Screen based activities Screen based activities were assessed with 4 closed questions adapted from Hakala et al., 20 Students were asked to report on the number of hours that they typically spent each day: (1) Watching TV/DVDs: using TVs and DVDs to watch TV programs and videos; (2) Playing: using computers, TV or PlayStation to play wired or standalone games; (3) Using mobile phones: using mobile phones to communicate or play; (4) Using computers: using desktop or portable computers and tablets for communicating and managing information. Response options for each question were: (1) do not use; (2) use 1h or less per day; (3) use 2–3h per day; (4) use 4–5h per day; and (5) more than 5h per day. Hakala et al., 20 assessed test-retest reliability of these questions using a K coefficient and reported K values between 0.45 and 0.65 indicating a fair to good agreement beyond chance. Data analysis The Predictive Analytics Software version 22 (PAWS software) (IBM, New York) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample in terms of age, sex, years of formal education, physical activity and screen time. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported for continuous variables and count and proportion were reported for categorical variables. A Chi-square test was used to investigate differences in the distribution of boys and girls for (i) attendance of physical activity classes, (ii) compliance with international guidelines for physical activity, (iii) type and intensity of physical activity and (iv) time spent (ordinal variable) in each of the four screen based activities. Differences between boys and girls for number of physical activities and time spent in moderate and vigorous activities were investigated using an independent sample t-test. The correlation between time per week spent in physical activity and screen time was investigated using the Spearman rho correlation coefficient and the strength of the correlation was interpreted as low if the coefficient was <0.3, moderate if it was between 0.3 and 0.5, and strong if it was >0.5. 21 Level of significance was set at p <0.05. Results A total of 969 (72.9%) students out of the total number of students (n =1330) answered the online questionnaire. Of these, 502 (51.8%) were girls and 467 (48.2%) were boys ranging in age from 13 to 21 years old (mean±SD=15.6±1.8 years). Physical activity Of the 969 respondents, 939 (97.0%) reported to regularly participate in the physical education classes against 29 (3.0%) who reported not to participate in these classes (one response missing). More girls than boys miss the physical education classes (χ 2(1)=9.01, p =0.002). Regarding moderate physical activity, 714 (73.7%) respondents reported to be involved in at least one moderate physical activity. From these 714 students, 18 (2.5%) did not report on the activity(ies) performed. Of the remaining 696 respondents, 304 (43.7%) reported one activity only, 265 (38.1%) reported 2 activities, 104 (14.9%) reported 3 activities, 20 (2.9%) reported 4 activities, 1 (0.01%) reported 5 activities and 2 (0.03%) reported 6 activities. The mean number of moderate activities per student was significantly higher for girls (mean±SD=1.49±1.17) compared to boys (mean±SD=1.23±0.97; p =0.003). The activities most reported were cycling (n =473, 66.2%) and walking to/from school (n =343, 48.0%). When considering the distribution of boys and girls per activity, it was found that more boys than girls reported cycling and skating and more girls than boys reported roller skating, walking to/from school and walking in general (Table 1 ). Nevertheless, when considering total time spent in moderate physical activities, no differences were found between boys and girls (boys: mean±SD=267.94±406.15; girls: mean±SD=211.99±225.22, p =0.25). Table 2 presents total time per week spent in moderate physical activity as well as total time per type of activity for the total sample. Regarding vigorous physical activities, a total of 575 (59.4%) respondents reported to participate in these activities. Of the 575 participants, 6 (1.0%) participants did not specify the activity in which they were involved. Of the remaining 569 participants, 438 (77.0%) reported one vigorous activity, 103 (18.1%) reported 2 activities, 24 (4.2%) reported 3 activities, 2 (0.04%) reported 4 activities and another 2 (0.04%) reported 5 activities. The activities most reported were football (n =146, 25.4%) and swimming (n =123, 21.4%) and a high number of participants signaled the response option “Other physical activities” (165, 28.7%). Despite the fact that more boys than girls reported to participate in vigorous physical activities (χ 2(1)=34.12, p <0.001), no significant differences were found in the mean number of vigorous activities per student between genders (boys: mean±SD=1.28±0.57; girls: mean±SD=1.30±0.62; p =0.34). When considering the distribution of boys and girls per activity, more boys than girls reported playing basket, football and other activities, while more girls than boys reported ballet, gymnastics, swimming and volleyball (Table 1). In addition, boys spent more time in vigorous physical activities than girls (boys: mean±SD=381.06±317.45; girls: mean±SD=309.41±286.87, p =0.005). Table 2 presents total time per week spent in vigorous physical activity as well as time per type of activity for the total sample. A total of 325 (35.3%) participants (from 832 valid data) reported at least 420min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Boys were more likely than girls to reach at least 420min of physical activity (χ 2(1)=30.94, p <0.001). A total of 128 out of 969 (13.2%) respondents did not report performing moderate or vigorous physical activity (in addition to physical education classes). Screen based activities Results concerning the use of electronic devices are presented in Table 3 . The percentage of participants reporting not to perform screen based activities varied between 5.4% who reported not watching TV, and 11.7% who reported not using mobile phones. A considerable percentage of participants report to spend 4h or more watching TV (11.0%), playing (20.6%), using mobile phones (30.2%) and using computers (19.6%). Boys tend to spend more time playing than girls (χ 2(4)=46.6; p <0.001), while girls tend to use mobile phones more than boys (χ 2(4)=45.7, p <0.001). Respondents who reported to spend more time in one screen based activity tend to also spend more time in the other screen based activities (Table 4 ). All but 5 respondents reported not to perform any of the four screen based activities enquired. Association between physical activity and screen based activities No significant differences were found between those reporting moderate or vigorous physical activity and those reporting no moderate or vigorous physical activity in terms of time spent of watching TV (χ 2(4)=4.85, p =0.77), playing (χ 2(4)=5.83, p =0.67), using mobile phones (χ 2(4)=7.76, p =0.46) or using computers (χ 2(4)=12.05, p =0.15). When correlating the amount of time spent in both moderate and vigorous physical activity and the use of electronic devices, a small but significant positive correlation was found between mobile phones and total time spent in moderate physical activity (r =0.09, p <0.05), total time spent in vigorous physical activity (r =0.13, p <0.05), total time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity (r =0.12, p <0.01), time spent in other moderate physical activities (r =0.36, p <0.01), walking to/from school (r =0.15, p <0.01), basket (r =0.27, p <0.01) and gymnastics (r =0.42, p <0.05) (Table 5 ), suggesting that an increase in the time spent in these physical activities is associated with increased use of mobile phones. A significant negative association was found between skating and watching TV/videos or DVDs. When investigating differences in the time spent in screen based activities between those performing at least 420min of moderate to vigorous physical activities and those performing less than 240min, a significant difference was found only for mobile phones (χ 2(4)=13.06, p =0.01), with those reporting less physical activity also reporting lower mobile phone usage. Discussion Our study results suggest a lack of association between watching TV, playing and using computers and time spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. This lack of association was present when examining the association for both total time spent in physical activity and time spent in individual modalities of physical activity, with the exception of a low negative association between skating and watching TV. In contrast, a low but significant positive association was found between mobile phones usage and time spent walking to/from school and in gymnastics and also between mobile phones usage and total time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity, suggesting that an increase in physical activity is associated with a greater use of mobile phones. Studies investigating the association between physical activity and screen based activities report conflicting results. In a 4 years longitudinal study involving 10856 US students aged 10–15 years old, no association was found between changes in television viewing, or sedentary behaviors in general, and changes in leisure-time moderate/vigorous physical activity. 12 In contrast, another 2 years longitudinal study 10 that examined the relationship between changes in time spent watching TV and playing, and frequency of leisure-time physical activity for 4594 US students found that a decrease in time spent watching TV was associated with an increase in frequency of leisure-time physical activity. Nevertheless, the correlation coefficients between physical activity and watching TV were small and varied between −0.11 and −0.21. These results are in line with the significant negative association found in the present study between time spent watching TV and time spent skating. A cross-sectional study including 200615 students aged 11–15 years old from 39 different countries in Europe and North America found that the presence/absence of an association between physical activity and screen time and the strength of the association (when found) varied across type of screen based activity and country. 9 There were stronger negative associations between screen-based activities and physical activities in North America and the Nordic European countries and positive or non-significant associations for East and Southern European countries. Portugal was not among the participating countries. Nevertheless, our study results are in line with the findings of Melkevic et al., 9 for the South European Countries and add to their claim that strategies to decrease sedentary behaviors and increase physical activity need to consider each country/region specificities. In what concerns time spent in moderate physical activities, our findings are similar to the estimates of a Norwegian study including 908 children age 11–13 years old, which reported a mean time of weekly physical activity of approximately 358min. 14 In what concerns vigorous physical activity, the cross nations study of Melkenik 9 including countries of the South Europe found that adolescents aged 11–15 years old spent approximately 124min per week in vigorous physical activity. Differences in the age of respondents are unlikely to contribute to the distinct results as time spent in physical activity decreases with age. 22 However, differences in the time period of physical activity considered for data collection may, at least partially, explain the higher mean time spent in vigorous physical activities found in the present study. While in the present study all activities performed in bouts of 10min or more were included, in the study of Melkevik, 9 only activities totalizing at least 60min were considered. Furthermore, the extremely high standard deviations found in the present study highlight the wide variability of type spent in physical activity among students. The finding that boys spend more time in vigorous physical activities when compared to girls is in line with the findings of Melkevik et al., 9 Nevertheless, Melkevik et al., 9 reported that only 11% of girls and 21% of boys meet the international guidelines of at least 60min of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily, 19 while in the present study this value is higher and reaches approximately 35%. A considerable percentage of participants report to spend 4h or more watching TV (11.0%), playing (20.6%), using mobile phones (30.2%) and using computers (19.6%). A systematic review 23 analyzing data from 539 independent samples reported that approximately 28% of young people spend more than 4h daily watching TV and 18% reported playing more than 4h per day. In line with the present study findings, boys were more likely to report higher levels of playing when compared to girls (30% vs. 7%, p <0.05), but contrary to our study findings, boys were significantly more likely to be high users of TV compared to girls. Melkevik et al., 9 reported that in South European countries, 43% (95% CI=41.49–42.82%) of students spend more than 2h daily watching TV, 17% (95% CI=15.81–16.79) spend more than 2h daily playing and 15% (95% CI=14.91–15.94) spend more than 2h daily using computers. These estimates are lower than those found in the present study where the percentage of students reporting 2 or more hours in the different screen-based activities varied between 50.3% and 52.9%. Nevertheless, a study in 7725 Canadian students aged 13–17 years old, 24 reported that 74% of boys and 59% of girls spent more than 2h daily in screen-based activities. These contrasting results may suggest that estimates of daily screen time may vary across countries/regions, but may also be associated with the constant evolution of electronic devices which diversity and availability to the general population increases rapidly. Similarly, in the present study the percentage of participants reporting not watching TV, playing, using mobile phones or computers varied between 5.4% and 11.7%, which are lower than those reported by Melkevik et al., 25 in a cross-national survey from 30 different countries, including Portugal. These authors found that 23% of girls and 19% of boys reported no electronic devices usage, but individual country estimates are not presented. Taken together we believe that this study results inform on the physical activities and screen based activities in which students are involved as well as on the time they spend on them. It shows that an important percentage of students may not be performing the recommended daily dose of physical activity, highlighting the need to continue the promotion of physical activity among students. Furthermore, it adds to the existing studies that suggest that screen based activities are not displacing physical activity and that interventions targeting each of these factors (i.e. aiming at increasing physical activity and decreasing screen based time) may need to pursue different strategies. Study limitations One limitation of this study is that we relied on self-reported measures for both physical activity and screen time, which could have influenced the results as they tend to be less accurate than objective measures. Furthermore, our study includes participants from a specific region of Portugal and, therefore, the generalizability to the whole country may be limited. Factors such as the family socioeconomic status, that seems to be associated with both physical activity and screen based time and vary across countries and regions, 26 were not included in the present study and should be considered in future studies. In addition, it would have been interesting to study the association between physical activity and the total time spent in screen based activities to understand how it compares to the individual association between physical activity and the time spent in each of the four screen based activities considered in the present study. Nevertheless, this was not possible due to the ordinal nature of this variable. Conclusion This study found no association between playing and using computers and physical activity, neither when considering type of physical activity nor when considering overall time spent in physical activity. A negative association was found between watching TV and skating and a positive association was found between mobile phones use and physical activity. These findings suggest that screen time is not displacing physical activity and that interventions aiming to promote the increase of physical activity and the decrease of screen time may need to address different factors. Further studies, both quantitative and qualitative, are needed to confirm and help understand the positive association between mobile use and physical activity.

Materiais e métodos 504 pessoas com 60 ou mais anos dos cuidados de saúde primários foram avaliadas quanto a: dor (NRS), funcionalidade percebida (WHODAS), performance (SPPB), depressão (GDS) e atividade física (RAPA). Resultados 376 (74,6%) participantes referiram dor; os 5 segmentos corporais mais afetados foram: a lombar (54,6%), os joelhos (50,8%), os ombros (29,5%), a anca (27,9%) e a cervical (24,7%). A presença de dor estava associada a menor funcionalidade, depressão e menor atividade física. Conclusões Instrumentos genéricos são capazes de distinguir alterações associadas à dor. Keywords Older adults Primary care Physical activity Functioning Depression Palavras-chave Idosos Cuidados de saúde primários Atividade física Funcionalidade Depressão Introduction Pain is highly prevalent in the general older adult population with bothersome pain in the last month affecting up to 52.9% of those aged 65 years or more. 1 In the primary health care setting, one month prevalence of any pain was shown to be 66.2% 2 and pain represents one in seven primary care consultations. 3 Particular syndromes such as chronic low back pain or knee pain are the most common complaints with a prevalence of up to 23.0% and 41.0%, respectively. 4,5 In addition, pain greatly interferes with daily life and the extend of this interference has been shown to have a more than twofold increase in the 80 years (35.0%) age group in relation to the 50 to 59 years age group (16.0%). 2 Pain interferes with the normal performance of a range of activities including moving around, recreational activities, sleep, self-care, household activities and work and psychological functioning. 6,7 Despite the considerable burden associated with pain in the primary care and its impact on self-reported disability and performance, 8 relatively little is known about the characteristics of older adults with pain. To improve the understanding and management of a health condition, accurate information is needed regarding the patients’ characteristics and their clinical presentation. 9 Previous studies have focused on specific pain syndromes such as low back pain or knee pain, 4,9,10 but few have presented data from more than one pain syndrome or from physical activity and depression, which are important predictors of pain associated disability. 8 Comprehensive assessment of patients in primary care is only feasible if instruments are easy to use in terms of the technical skills and specialized equipment required, are broadly applicable and appropriate for a range of age and cultural groups. 11 Furthermore, the use of a pre-defined battery of tests that is routinely applied in a large group of patients and by different health professionals (e.g. doctors, physiotherapists or nurses) is likely to favor routine assessment and comparability of results. Therefore, the aims of this study are to (i) describe the characteristics of a sample of patients aged ≥60 years old attending primary care, in terms of pain, self-reported disability, performance, depression and physical activity and (ii) explore whether generic measures of self-reported disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 – WHODAS 2.0), performance (Short Physical Performance Battery – SPPB), physical activity (Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity – RAPA) and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale – GDS) are able to differentiate between those with and those without pain at specific body sites. Each instrument takes less than 10min to complete and do not require specialized training or equipment, rendering them easy to use in primary care. Additionally, the SPPB and WHODAS 2.0 have been shown to be reliable and valid among several elderly populations that differ in terms of culture, language and education. 12–14 Material and methods The present study refers to the cross sectional baseline analysis of a 12-month cohort study which aims to evaluate the association between disability and primary care consumption. Participants Participants were older adults comprising a convenience sample and were recruited through primary health care practices, either by referral from health care practitioners or direct invitation by researchers, among those attending health services on the days of data collection. Participants were recruited from 18 primary care practices located across the Councils of Aveiro, Ílhavo and Vagos, Portugal. The number of participants from each council and health care practice was proportional to the population served and this was calculated as follows: (i) an a priori sample size calculation considering the total number of inhabitants from Aveiro, Ílhavo and Vagos aged 18 years old and over, a confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval of 4% indicated that 504 participants would be needed; (ii) the total sample size calculated (n =504) was subdivided according to the percent contribution of each municipality, resulting in 259 participants from Aveiro, 147 participants from Ílhavo and 98 participants from Vagos. The number of participants assessed at each primary care practice within the same municipality was calculated based on the percentage of inhabitants served at each practice by sex and age group. Participants could be enrolled in the study if they were ≥60 years old and were able to give written informed consent. This was ascertained by asking participants to explain on their own words what the study involved. Sixty years old was used as the cut off for older adults in line with the United Nations definition The study received Ethical approval from the Regional Health Administration Commission, Coimbra, Portugal. All participants signed an informed consent prior to their participation. Procedures All participants were interviewed once by a researcher at the primary health care center that the participant usually attended. All researchers involved in data collection were previously trained. Training included the presentation of instruments and methods of application, their application to participants not included in the study and posterior discussion of results. Data collection took place between March 2012 and March 2014. Demographic and health characteristics, aspects of pain, self-reported disability, performance, depressive symptoms and physical activity were assessed. The specific procedures and instruments used are specified below. Demographic and health characteristics Demographic and health characteristics included age, sex, years of formal education, occupation, marital status and presence of chronic disorders. The presence of the latest was ascertained by asking participants whether they had any of the following conditions: (i) hypertension, (ii) diabetes, (iii) cardiovascular disorders, (iv) respiratory disorders, (v) cancer, (vi) osteoarthritis (back, hip or knee), (vii) other known medical condition or (viii) any medical condition for which the nature/medical diagnosis was not known. The total number of reported chronic conditions was counted. The categorization of comorbidities based on number of comorbidities has been used in previous studies. 6,15 Pain intensity, frequency, duration and number of pain sites Pain assessment in clinical practice is essential for older people and requires the use of instruments that are easy and simple to understand. 16 Published guidelines for pain assessment in older people recommend the use of a vertical numeric graphic rating scale and of a body chart for the assessment of pain intensity and location, respectively. 16 In the present study, global pain intensity (pain intensity considering all the pain sites) in the day of data collection was measured using a 10cm vertical numeric graphic rating scale, with 0 for no pain and 10 for the most severe pain imaginable. Participants were also asked to mark on a body chart where they felt pain in the preceding week. The body segments were participants reported pain were identified and the number of pain sites was counted and categorized as (1) single pain site, (2) two pain sites, (3) 3 or more pain sites but not meeting the criteria for widespread pain and (4) widespread pain. Widespread pain was defined as pain in the left and right side of the body, pain above and below the waist and axial-skeletal pain. 17 Both the numeric rating scale and the body chart have been shown to be valid and reliable in older people. 18,19 Body segments with pain were also identified. In addition, pain frequency and duration were also assessed using two forced choice questions. Pain frequency during the week before the interview was assessed by asking participants to choose one of the following options: (1) seldom (once a week), (2) occasionally (2 to 3 times a week), (3) often (more than 3 times a week) or (4) always (all days). This was transformed into a two level variable for analysis: (1) pain seldom or occasionally and (2) pain often or always. To characterize pain duration participants were asked for how long they felt pain and answers were categorized as (1) <6 months and (2) ≥6 months. Self-reported disability Self-reported disability was assessed using the Portuguese version of the 12-item interview administered version of WHODAS 2.0, which is valid and reliable. 20 The WHODAS 2.0 is a disability assessment instrument based on the conceptual framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health with a recall period of 30 days and provides a global measure of disability. 12 WHODAS 2.0 scores were computed according to the simple scoring method as indicated in the manual. 12 This included summing the scores assigned to each of the 12 items – “none” (1), “mild” (2), moderate (3), severe (4) and extreme (5). The sum score for global disability therefore ranged from 0 (no disability) to 60 (complete disability), with higher scores indicating higher levels of disability. Performance-based disability Performance-based disability was assessed using the SPPB. 21 SPPB total score is a composite score based on the individual scores of three timed tasks: the ability to stand with the feet side by side/semitandem/tandem for 10s (balance), usual walking speed (calculated over 3 meters), and the ability to rise from a chair as quickly as possible for five consecutive times. Each of the three performance measures was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the inability to complete the test and 4 indicating the highest level of performance. A summary score (range 0–12) was subsequently calculated by adding the scores of each individual test. Higher scores reflect higher levels of function. 21 Depressive symptoms Depressive symptoms were assessed using the short version of the Portuguese translation of the GDS, 22 a valid and reliable 15 item self-report scale of depression initially developed for adults aged 65 years or more. 23 However, a more recent study 24 showed that its level of sensitivity and specificity for patients aged less than 65 is comparable to that of patients aged more than 65 years. Therefore, GDS was adopted in this study. Participants are asked to respond by answering yes or no to each of the 15 items: 10 items indicate the presence of depression when answered positively and 5 indicate depression when answered negatively. For the comparative analysis we used the GDS total score and for descriptive purposes we dichotomized the results as (1) no depressive symptoms (4 points or less) and (2) depressive symptoms (5 points or more). 24 Physical activity Physical activity was assessed using the Portuguese version of the RAPA questionnaire. 25,26 This questionnaire was specifically designed for use with older people and has 9 items (7+2) with response options of yes or no. The total score of the first seven items is from 1 to 7 points, with the respondent's score categorized into one of five levels of physical activity: (1) sedentary (item 1: I rarely or never do any physical activities), (2) underactive (item 2: I do some light or moderate physical activities, but not every week), (3) regular underactive, light activities (item 3: I do some light physical activity every week), (4) regular underactive (item 4: I do moderate physical activities every week, but less than 30min a day or 5 days a week; and item 5: I do vigorous physical activities every week, but less than 20min a day or 3 days a week), and (5) regular active (items 6: I do 30min or more a day of moderate physical activities, 5 or more days a week; and item 7: I do 20min or more a day of vigorous physical activities, 3 or more days a week). The last 2 items are about strength training and flexibility and are scored separately for individuals that reach the item 7 only as: (1) strength training, (2) flexibility or (3) both. 25 Comparative analysis was performed using the levels of physical activity reported by participants. Additionally, count and proportion of those achieving and not achieving recommended levels of physical activity were also reported. Recommended levels were defined as moderate to moderately vigorous aerobic (endurance) activity, with a total weekly volume of 150–180min/wk. 27 Statistical analysis The Predictive Analytics Software (PAWS software, IBM, New York) (formerly SPSS Statistics) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample in terms of age, sex, years of formal education, occupation, marital status, chronic conditions, depression, WHODAS 2.0 scores, SPPB scores, RAPA scores, and pain characteristics for participants without pain, for those with pain and considering the five most reported body sites with pain. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported for continuous variables and count and proportion were reported for categorical variables. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare RAPA scores between groups (no pain vs. pain at a specific location vs. pain elsewhere) and One Way ANOVAS for the remaining comparisons (age, years of formal education, number of comorbidities, WHODAS and SPPB scores). The Bonferroni test was used for post hoc comparisons. Level of significance was set at p <0.05. Results Sample characteristics A total of 504 (338 females and 166 males) participants aged (mean±SD) 70.9±7.5 years entered the study. A detailed characterization of the sample is presented in Table 1 . Pain characterization A total of 376 (74.6%) participants reported pain in at least one body site during the week preceding data collection. Mean global pain intensity at the time of data collection was 5.8±2.3. In general, most participants had multisite or widespread pain (224; 59.6%), that was present for ≥6 months (313; 83.2%) and very often or always present (286; 76.5%) (Table 2 ). The five pain sites most commonly reported were: low back (54.8%), knee (50.8%), shoulder (29.5%), hip (27.9%) and neck (24.7%) and for this reason these groups were used in the comparative analysis. When considering participants reporting pain at each of these five body sites, results show that pain at multiple locations is present independently of the specific pain location considered (low back, knee, shoulder, hip or neck). The percentage of patients reporting one pain site only, varied between 1.8% for those reporting shoulder pain and 13.1% for those reporting low back pain. The percentage of patients with widespread pain varied between 26.7% in the group of participants with knee pain and 41.4% in the group of participants with shoulder pain (Table 3 ). Global mean pain intensity was quite similar across the five pain syndromes considered. Pain very often or always was reported by a percentage of patients that varied between 81.7% (low back pain) and 87.1% (neck pain) and pain for 6 months or more was reported by a percentage of patients that varied between 84.7% (hip pain) and 92.3 (low back pain). Self-reported disability and performance Overall, participants reporting pain at the body sites considered (low back, knee, shoulder, hip and neck) showed significantly higher levels of self-reported disability, took longer to walk 3m and to perform the chair stands and scored lower in the SPPB when compared to those without pain (Table 4 ). Additionally, participants with pain failed the balance test more often than those without pain (Pearson chi-square≤0.001; able to complete test adjusted residuals: “no pain” group=3.6; “pain elsewhere” group – between 0.4 and −2.5; pain at specific locations group – between −0.8 and −3.7). When comparing those reporting pain at a specific body site with those reporting pain elsewhere, participants with low back pain were found to score lower in the SPPB than those reporting pain elsewhere; participants with knee pain showed higher self-reported and performance based disability and took more time to perform chair stands than those with pain elsewhere; participants with shoulder pain and neck pain showed higher levels of self-reported disability than those with pain elsewhere. Overall, results seem to suggest that both WHODAS and SPPB are able to capture pain associated disability independently of pain location. Depression Participants in all pain groups (the specific condition pain groups and the “pain elsewhere” groups) showed significantly higher scores in the GDS, consistent with more depressive symptoms, than the “no pain” group. In addition, participants with low back and neck pain showed significantly higher scores in the GDS than participants with pain elsewhere. Percentage of patients with and without depression is presented in Table 5 . Physical activity Participants in all pain groups (the specific condition pain groups and the “pain elsewhere” groups) showed significantly less physical activity than the “no pain” group (Pearson chi-square ≤0.01; equal or above recommended physical activity levels adjusted residuals: “no pain” group=3; pain groups ≥−2). Percentage of participants achieving the recommended levels of physical activity varied between 7.5% and 11.4% across the specific condition pain groups and was 18.8% in the “no pain” group (Table 5). Discussion Firstly, the results of this study show that most patients reporting low back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, hip pain and neck pain also report pain at other body sites. Secondly, general measures of self-reported disability (WHODAS 2.0) and performance (SPPB) seem to be able to capture pain associated disability independently of pain location as they were able to differentiate between individuals with low back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, hip pain and neck pain and those without pain. The same applies to the general measures of physical activity (RAPA) and depression (GDS). Additionally, individuals presenting with each of these specific pain syndromes seem to have similar age, education, number of comorbidities, self-reported disability, performance, depressive symptoms and level of physical activity when compared to individuals reporting pain elsewhere. Nevertheless, we did not perform statistical comparisons between groups with different pain syndromes and, therefore, it needs to be explored in future studies. Taken together, this study results suggest that specific painful syndromes do not tend to occur in isolation and are associated with increased disability, decreased levels of physical activity and increased levels of depression, which could be captured by generic instruments. We found that the five most commonly reported pain body sites were: low back (54.8%), knee (24.8%), shoulder (29.5%), hip (27.9%) and neck (24.7%). Despite differences in body site pain prevalence, the first four body sites were also the body sites most commonly reported by Patel et al., 1 in a community based survey (back=30.3%, knee=24.8%, shoulder=19.9%, hip=17.7%). The neck (16.0%) occupied the 7th place after the foot (17.7%) and the hand (16.8%). Differences in prevalence values might be explained by the settings were studies took place (community vs. primary care centers). We also found that 19.0% of the participants reported pain in one body site only and 16.0% reported widespread pain. The percentage for single body site pain is even lower when considering only those with low back, knee, shoulder, hip or neck pain (between 1.8% and 13.1%), while the percentage of widespread pain is higher (between 26.2% and 41.4). Carnes et al. 28 in a community based study with younger participants (mean age 52 years old) has shown that only 14% or less of those reporting chronic pain have it in a single site and that 33% had widespread pain. Viniol et al., 29 conducted a study with 647 patients with low back pain at primary care and reported that a quarter had widespread pain. These figures are similar to those found in the present study for the group of patients with low back pain (26.0%). Croft et al., 4 in a sample of almost 9000 participants aged 50 years old or more and registered with 3 general practices reported that 57.0% of those with knee pain reported at least pain in to other body regions. This percentage is also similar to that found in the present study (54.0%). Mean SPPB scores (no pain=9.5±1.7; pain groups=between 7.1±2.7 and 8.5±2.5) and mean WHODAS 2.0 scores (no pain=14.5±3.5; pain groups=between 19.1±6.8 and 23.6±8.5) found in this study are similar to those previously reported in the literature for older adults aged 65 years or more. Cecchi et al., 30 in a sample of 120 community older adults with hip pain and 886 without hip pain reported mean (±SD) SPPB scores of 8.7±3.3 and 9.8±3.1, respectively. In the same study, mean (±SD) SPPB scores in 225 participants with knee pain was 8.9±3.3 and was 9.9±3.1 in a sample of 781 participants without knee pain. Bean et al., 31 assessed 137 older adults with limited mobility and reported mean (±SD) SPPB scores of 8.7±1.5. Gomes et al., 32 assessed 313 older adults who lived in the community and presented SPPB results separately for those participants with depressive symptoms (mean±SD=7.4±2.9) and without depressive symptoms (mean±SD=8.9±2.4). Sousa et al., 33 assessed older people living in seven low-and middle-income countries (urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Mexico, Peru, China and India). The sample size for each country varied between 2000 and 3000 participants and mean (±SD) WHODAS 2.0 scores varied between 15.7±15.4 and 33.2±28.9. The low percentage of participants that achieved recommended levels of physical activity even in the group that reported no pain (18.8%) and the fact that those in the pain groups, independently of the body site, showed lower levels of physical activity than those without pain highlight the need of strategies to improve physical activity levels as a means of preventing disability and improve health in general. A systematic review on the relationship between functional independence and physical activity recommends physical activity above baseline “normal” daily activity levels at an intensity of moderate to moderately vigorous aerobic (endurance) activity, with a total weekly volume of 150–180min/wk. This physical activity would translate to a >30% decrease in the relative risk of morbidity and mortality, and loss of independence, and further benefit would accrue with greater physical activity and greater fitness gains. 27 Another systematic review aiming to establish global levels of physical activity among older people 34 reported that across the 53 included papers, the percentage of older adults meeting the guidelines varied widely, ranging from 2.4% to 83.0%. Similarly, the high percentage of participants reporting depressive symptoms and the fact that those in the pain groups reported more depressive symptoms than those without pain highlight the importance of considering depression in the primary care. This is in agreement with a previous study of our team 6 where depression emerged as the second most important predictor of self-reported disability. Also Penninx et al., 35 found that depression has a large impact on physical decline over time among community-dwelling older persons. This study has several implications for clinical practice at the primary care setting, in particular for the assessment of patients with pain: • Pain should be routinely assessed at primary care for older adults and patients with a specific pain complaint should always be screened for pain in other body sites as pain at multiple body sites is highly common; • Generic measures of self-reported and performance-based disability, WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB, respectively, are able to capture pain associated disability and therefore could be included in the routine assessment of patients with pain independently of pain location; • Generic measures of physical activity and depression are able to capture differences between patients with and without pain and could also be included in the routine assessment of patients with pain independently of pain location. Additionally, our results suggest that pain management should consider addressing generalized pain rather than pain at specific locations or at least consider whether managing pain at one body site has beneficial effects on the generalized pain and that pain management strategies should consider depression and physical activity. Study limitations The results of this study need to be seen in light of its limitations. First of all, reason to seek primary care and which painful site was the main complaint were not known. This limits the interpretation of study results, but also suggests that pain is relevant even in situations where it might not be the reason to seek primary care. Secondly, patients were asked to report on pain intensity considering all pain sites, rather than a specific pain site. This precluded pain intensity comparisons between pain groups. Thirdly, we did not include measures of upper limb performance. Study results show that participants reporting pain in the neck and upper limb had lower scores in the SPPB, which includes tasks that are heavily dependent on lower limbs function. The opposite, i.e., whether groups reporting pain in the lower limbs performed worse in upper limb measures than those without pain could not be assessed. Finally, as patients in one pain group could also belong to other pain groups it was not possible to statistically compare these groups. Future studies should compare patients with different specific body site main complaints. Conclusions Primary care patients present with multiple pain sites which are associated with self-reported and performance based disability, decreased physical activity and increased depression. Generic instruments of self-reported disability (WHODAS 2.0), performance (SPPB), physical activity (RAPA) and depression (GDS) were able to capture changes associated with pain independently of pain location. Therefore, these instruments should be considered in the routine assessment of patients reporting pain at primary care. Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

And it makes very difficult to characterize, in a centralized manner, the studies performed on each patient. In this context, is there a way to perform population characterization and patient centered studies by analyzing the DICOM metadata stored on Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) from different healthcare facilities? This paper presents the results of population characterization with chest radiographic studies performed on Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DX) modalities in three healthcare facilities. It also identifies the studies conducted on the patient that, in each healthcare facility, in addition to chest radiographic studies, had a higher number of radiological studies involving ionizing radiation. The final sample consists of 95.433 images, corresponding to 89.980 studies belonging to 56.547 patients. The methodology used made it possible to characterize the population by age group, gender and modality, the average number of studies per patient in each age group, as well as the patient with the highest number of chest radiographic studies per modality in each of the healthcare facilities. The results clearly demonstrate the relevance of the use of DICOM metadata stored in disperse PACS archives for population characterization, as well as to identify resources utilization trends and situations that may represent patient radiation over-exposure.",

Tel.: +351 234 247 110; fax: +351 234401597. In clinical environments the information resulting from the provision of healthcare is increasingly used to improve the delivery of healthcare. In the radiology context, the data analysis used to characterize the population that accesses different radiology departments is often supported by software applications from different manufacturers, which makes data integration very difficult. And it makes very difficult to characterize, in a centralized manner, the studies performed on each patient. In this context, is there a way to perform population characterization and patient centered studies by analyzing the DICOM metadata stored on Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) from different healthcare facilities? This paper presents the results of population characterization with chest radiographic studies performed on Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DX) modalities in three healthcare facilities. It also identifies the studies conducted on the patient that, in each healthcare facility, in addition to chest radiographic studies, had a higher number of radiological studies involving ionizing radiation. The final sample consists of 95.433 images, corresponding to 89.980 studies belonging to 56.547 patients. The methodology used made it possible to characterize the population by age group, gender and modality, the average number of studies per patient in each age group, as well as the patient with the highest number of chest radiographic studies per modality in each of the healthcare facilities. The results clearly demonstrate the relevance of the use of DICOM metadata stored in disperse PACS archives for population characterization, as well as to identify resources utilization trends and situations that may represent patient radiation over-exposure.

However, the relationship between both types of measures is not yet completely understood, in particular for older adults attending primary care. Objective. The main objective of the study was to investigate the association between the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) for older adults at primary care. A secondary objective was to determine the influence of sociodemographic and health-related variables on this relationship. Design. This was a cross-sectional study. Methods. A total of 504 participants aged 60 years and older from 18 different primary care centers underwent a one-session assessment including: sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, performance, self-reported disability, pain, depressive symptoms, and physical activity. Performance was assessed using the SPPB, and self-reported disability was assessed using the WHODAS 2.0. Results. The correlation between WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores was strong (r .65). Regression analysis showed that the SPPB total score explained 41.7% of the variance in WHODAS 2.0 scores (adjusted R2 41.6%). A second model including the SPPB subtests (balance, gait, and sit-to-stand), depressive symptoms, number of pain sites, pain intensity, and level of physical activity explained 61.7% of the variance in WHODAS 2.0 scores (adjusted R2 60.4%). No model improvement was found when considering the 6 WHODAS 2.0 individual domains. Limitations. The cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow inferences on causal relationships. Conclusions. This study’s findings confirm that self-report and performance-based measures relate to different aspects of functioning. Further study is needed to determine if primary care interventions targeting lower extremity performance and depressive symptoms improve self-reported disability.",

The second phase consisted of the validity and reliability assessment. The PSSUQ has excelent internal consistency (α = 0.80), as well as, satisfactory inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.67). The PSSUQ presents construct validity, with a high and significant correlation with an overall usability evaluation question (r=0.84, p<0.05).

The acceptance of the AAL paradigm is closely related to the quality of the available systems, namely in terms of intelligent functions for the user interaction. In that context, usability and accessibility are crucial issues to consider. This paper presents a systematic literature review of AAL technologies, products and services with the objective of establishing the current position regarding user interaction and how are end users involved in the AAL development and evaluation processes. For this purpose, a systematic review of the literature on AAL was undertaken. A total of 1,048 articles were analyzed, 111 of which were mainly related to user interaction and 132 of which described practical AAL systems applied in a specified context and with a well-defined aim. Those articles classified as user interaction and systems were further characterized in terms of objectives, target users, users’ involvement, usability and accessibility issues, settings to be applied, technologies used and development stages. The results show the need to improve the integration and interoperability of the existing technologies and to promote user-centric developments with a strong involvement of end users, namely in what concerns usability and accessibility issues.",

Introduction Usability assessment is an important part of the overall design and development of a product or service, which consists of iterative cycles of prototyping, design and validation [1]. Ideally, the usability evaluation must be present at all stages of the design and development process, and must be iterative in order to allow a continuous improvement of the results. * Corresponding author.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license Peer-review under responsibility of organizing committee of the 6th International Conference on Software Development and Technologies for Enhancing Accessibility and Fighting Info-exclusion (DSAI 2015) 294 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 293 â€“ 300 The literature describes a large number of methodologies and tools used to ensure the usability quality of a product or service [2, 3]. There are usability evaluation methods for all design and development phases, from initial definition to the final changes of the product or service [4]. Furthermore, some of these methods are only suitable for a specific stage of the development process [5]. Within the usability evaluation methods described in the literature [2, 3], questionnaires assume a significant importance for qualitative self-reported data collection about the characteristics, thoughts, feelings, perceptions, behaviors or attitudes of users [4]. Questionnaires have the advantage of being low budget techniques, they do not require test equipment, and their results reflect the usersâ€™ opinions. They also provide useful information about what are the strengths and weaknesses of a product or service. In the 80s researchers felt the need to develop and evaluate products in a systematic and methodical way, considering questionnaireâ€™s psychometric properties [6]. Since then several questionnaires were developed and validated, and have long been used in the evaluation of products and services. However, a research through the major scientific databases related to usability assessment revealed the absence of questionnaires validated for the European Portuguese language. Whereby the evaluation of usability is a key aspect in the development of products and services, it is urgent to have validated questionnaires able to be applied within the Portuguese context. The fact that the System Usability Scale (SUS) is one of the usability evaluation questionnaires most widely used [7] justifies the importance of having a European Portuguese version. However, in order to guarantee the quality of the resulting questionnaire, it is not enough to perform a literal translation of the SUS original version. A linguistic and cultural adaptation is crucial to ensure that the constructs of each item of the translated questionnaire have the same meaning as the respective original item, and an observational study must be implemented to verify the internal consistence of the resulting questionnaire, as well as its validity (i.e. accuracy of the results) and reliability (i.e. consistency of measurements, namely if they are reproducible). This paper presents the translation, cultural adaptation and contribution to the validation of the European Portuguese version of SUS and is in line with current efforts of promoting an active involvement of end users in the design and development of new products and services [8]. In addition to this introductory section, the paper comprises four more sections: Related Work, Methodology, Results, and Discussion and Conclusions. 2. Related Work The System Usability Scale (SUS) was developed by John Brooke more than 25 years ago as part of a usability engineering program (1986) as a â€œquick and dirtyâ€� survey scale that would allow the usability practitioner to quickly and easily assess the usability of a given product or service. The SUS development reflected a strong need in the usability community for a tool that could collect a userâ€™s subjective rating of the usability of a product or service [9]. About a decade later the author published a chapter describing SUS in a book about usability engineering in industry [10]. Since then, its use in a variety of research projects and industrial evaluations has increased as SUS has been made freely available for use in usability assessment [10]. SUS is an inexpensive, yet effective tool, for assessing the usability of a product, as well as a wide range of user interfaces, including standard operative system based software interfaces, Web pages and Web applications, cell phones, landline phones, modem and networking equipment, pagers, interactive voice response systems (IVR), speech systems, or video delivery hardware and software. The principal value of SUS is that it provides a single reference score for participantsâ€™ view of a productâ€™s usability [9]. SUS is robust and its use is well established and generalized, with more than 1200 publications [11]. Since the beginning of data collection using SUS in 1996, Bangor and colleagues [9] reported 2324 surveys over the course of 206 studies. For this reason SUS is now considered an â€œindustry standardâ€� [11]. The SUS has several attributes that make it a good choice for general usability practitioners [9]: â€¢ The survey is technology free, making it flexible enough to assess a wide range of technologies. â€¢ It is quick and easy to fill. 295 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 293 â€“ 300 â€¢ It provides a single score on a scale that is easily understood by the wide range of people (from project managers to computer programmers) who are typically involved in the development of products and services and who may have little or no experience in human factors and usability. â€¢ It is a nonproprietary survey, making it a cost effective tool. SUS is composed of 10 statements that are scored on a 5 point Likert scale of strength of agreement. Its final score can range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better usability. Because the statements alternate between the positive and negative, care must be taken when scoring the survey [9, 10]. The total score of SUS is calculated through the formula defined by Brooke [10]: â€¢ For odd items: subtract one from the user response. â€¢ For even-numbered items: subtract the user responses from 5. â€¢ Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5. This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 0 to 40. SUS scores are not percentages, despite returning a value between 0 and 100. To understand how a product compares to others, itâ€™s necessary to look at its percentile ranking. A SUS score above 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average [11]. Originally, the SUS was used in one-time, isolated tests to determine a single usability and satisfaction score for a given product or service. As its use within human factors groups became more frequent, more uses became evident and were adopted. Over the last 10 years it has been used to: â€¢ Provide a point estimate measure of usability and customer satisfaction. â€¢ Compare different tasks within the same interface. â€¢ Compare iterative versions of the same system. â€¢ Compare competing implementations of a system. â€¢ Competitive assessment of comparable user interfaces. â€¢ Compare different interface technologies. While SUS was only intended to measure perceived ease-of-use (a single dimension), recent research shows that it provides a global measure of system satisfaction [12]. Furthermore, it can be divided into two sub-scales of usability and learnability: Usable (8 items) and Learnable (2 items - specifically, Items 4 and 10). These subscales correlate highly with the overall SUS (r = .99 and .78, respectively) and correlate significantly with one another (r = .66) [12]. This scale proved to be applicable to different languages, and has been translated into Spanish, French, and Dutch [13]. The translated versions were shown to have similar reliability to the original English version [13]. Therefore, the objective of this study is to translate, adapt to the Portuguese culture and contribute to the validation of the European Portuguese version of SUS. 3. Methodology For a measuring instrument to be applied in different cultures, it is important to ensure that the translations and adaptations are equivalent. The cross-cultural adaptation of an instrument involves two main steps: i) Scale translation - assessment of the conceptual and linguistic equivalence, and ii) Scale Validation - evaluation of the psychometric properties [14]. The translation, cultural and linguistic adaptation of the SUS to Portuguese followed the internationally established guidelines [15], in order to ensure the quality of the resulting translation and the semantic equivalence (i.e. the consistency of the meaning of concepts between this version and the original) [14]. 296 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 293 â€“ 300 3.1. Phase I - Scale Translation The translation process of the original version of SUS was performed in accordance with the internationally established guidelines [16] and involved the following steps: â€¢ Step 1 (Translation): The original version of SUS was translated to European Portuguese by two independent translators, a health professional and a technology professional, whose native language is European Portuguese. â€¢ Step 2 (Reconciliation version): Three researchers compared the two translations and built a reconciliation version between them and the original version of SUS. â€¢ Step 3 (Retroversion): The reconciliation version was translated from European Portuguese into English by a translator whose native language is English, without training in health and without knowledge of the original versions of SUS. The retroversion was made to confront the original version with the translated one and analyze if both are equivalent. â€¢ Step 4 (Pre-final version): A committee of three researchers developed the pre-final versions of SUS based on the back-translation and on the original instrument. â€¢ Step 5 (Pilot Test): The pre-final version was submitted to a pilot test with 4 individuals of the general population to assess the easiness / difficulty of understanding of the questions, according to the methodology proposed by Foddy [16]. The information collected was used to improve the tool and build the final version. â€¢ Step 6: The back-translation and the description of the methodology used in the translation process were sent, as a courtesy, to the author of the original version. 3.2. Phase II - Scale Validation For the scale validation, an observational study was performed in a church-sponsored charity institution, the Santa Casa da MisericÃ³rdia de Oliveira do Bairro. The reliability and validity of the SUS was based on real data collection. This process consisted of a usability assessment of a web based Agenda. An agenda application was selected because it is an easy concept that virtually everyone understands and are familiar with. The usability was evaluated with SUS and another usability scale, the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) that was validated for European Portuguese, together with a general usability question. The PSSUQ is a usability evaluation questionnaire based on scenarios that was developed by IBM. It consists of 19 items aimed at addressing five usability characteristics of a system: rapid completion of the task, ease of learning, high quality documentation and online information, functional adequacy and rapid acquisition of productivity [17]. The general usability question evaluates global usability using just one question was based on the After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) developed by Lewis [18]: overall, how would you rate the application on a scale from 0 to 10? This question is accompanied by a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, in order to facilitate the completion of the question. The sample was selected according to the following inclusion criteria: age over 18 years, ability to read, understand and sign the informed consent. The only exclusion criterion was the presence of limitation on the thick upper limb movements. The observational study took place between November, 2013 and February, 2014, and comprised two sessions separated by 2 to 4 weeks for each subject. The sessions consisted of four parts: â€¢ Introduction - The evaluator applied a social demographic questionnaire and then delivered the session script, explaining orally all information contained therein. â€¢ Test - The subject performed the tasks described in the session script. â€¢ Usability Assessment Instruments - The evaluator assisted the instruments filling, namely the SUS, PSSUQ and a general usability question. â€¢ Summary - The evaluator thanked the participation of the subject and, if necessary, scheduled the next evaluation session. 297 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 293 â€“ 300 All adults able to fill in the instruments used in this usability assessment were eligible to participate if they gave written informed consent. The written informed consent was obtained prior to data collection. In order to address the ethical considerations, a request of approval was directed to the administration of the Santa Casa da MisericÃ³rdia de Oliveira do Bairro. Prior to the translation and validation of the SUS we requested the authors of the original version for permission. Among that, all data collection was anonymized. The involved subjects received all the information regarding the study and their participation before completing the informed consent. The user was asked to use the web based agenda in order to check the different tasks assigned for each day of the week, interacting freely with the application. Each user explored the Agenda for about 10 minutes. The results and interpretation of the SUS were conducted within the defined parameters for the original scale. To describe and characterize the subjects who constitute the population sample, central tendency and dispersion measures were used, including mean, range and standard deviation. The inter-rater reliability was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and percentage of agreement. The ICC varies between 0 and 1, and is considered \"weak\" (ICC <0.40); \"satisfactory\" (0.40 â‰¤ ICC <0.75); and \"very good\" (ICC â‰¥ 0.75). A percentage of agreement above 80% is considered acceptable. To calculate the percentage of agreement the qualitative score (usable vs. non-usable) of each SUS evaluation (first and second evaluation moment) was compared. In other words, we counted the number of participants that classified the web application as usable and non-usable (based on the SUS cut-off point defined by the author, i.e., 68 points) in both evaluation moments, and calculated the percentage of agreement. The correlation between the SUS and the two other scales was assessed by a Spearman Correlation Coefficient. The level of significance was set at p <0.05. Statistical analyzes were performed with SPSS - Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago). 4. Results 4.1. Phase 1 - Scale Translation The retroversion and the original scale were compared and considered equivalent in semantic and content meaning. The pilot study was conducted with 4 participants from the general community, 2 male and 2 female, aged between 26 and 58 years. The participants understood the semantic and the content of each item. However they found that the SUS alternative items (positive/negative) may turn the scale slightly more difficult to fill. Even so the authors decided to maintain the alternative items identical to the original scale. In general, the European Portuguese version of SUS was considered easy to understand. The translation process resulted in 10 items that were considered equivalent to the corresponding items of the original SUS (Table 1). 298 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 293 â€“ 300 Original Item Corresponding item in Portuguese I think that I would like to use this system frequently. Acho que gostaria de utilizar este produto com frequÃªncia. I found the system unnecessarily complex. Considerei o produto mais complexo do que necessÃ¡rio. I thought the system was easy to use. Achei o produto fÃ¡cil de utilizar. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. Acho que necessitaria de ajuda de um tÃ©cnico para conseguir utilizar este produto. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. Considerei que as vÃ¡rias funcionalidades deste produto estavam bem integradas. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. Achei que este produto tinha muitas inconsistÃªncias. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. Suponho que a maioria das pessoas aprenderia a utilizar rapidamente este produto. I found the system very cumbersome to use. Considerei o produto muito complicado de utilizar. I felt very confident using the system. Senti-me muito confiante a utilizar este produto. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. Tive que aprender muito antes de conseguir lidar com este produto. Table 1 - Original item vs. corresponding item in European Portuguese 4.2. Phase II - Scale Validation The sample consisted of 32 participants with an average age of 47 years (SD = 14.56). The sample was mostly female 87.50%. The characterization of the sample is described in Table 2. Gender n (%) Female 28 (87.50) Male 4 (12.50) Age (years) Mean (SD) 47 (14.56) Min - Max 20 â€“ 84 Table 2 - Sample characterization Regarding the reliability results, the ICC value is 0.36 which indicates weak inter-rater reliability (CI 95% - 0.01; 0.63), while the percentage of agreement is 76.67%, 23 of the 30 participants that completed the SUS twice agreed with themselves in relation to the usable/non-usable usability of the web application. Regarding the scale validation phase, results show that the SUS and PSSUQ presented a correlation of r = 0.70 (p < 0.05) which suggests that both evaluate the same construct that indicates construct validity. Similarly, the correlation between SUS and the general usability question (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) also indicates that the Portuguese version of SUS has construct validity. This results show that the correlation between the SUS and PSSUQ and between the SUS and the general usability question is high and statistically significant. 5. Discussion and Conclusions This study aimed to translate and adapt the original version of SUS into the European Portuguese language and culture and contribute to its validation. The results of the scale translation phase indicate that the items were easy to 299 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 293 â€“ 300 understand and there were no semantic or content problems. The translated items were considered equivalent to the original version. This translation, cultural adaptation and contribution to the validation of the European Portuguese version of SUS is in line with the authors work that has been focused in involving the end used in the development and validation of new products and services [8, 19-21]. In this sense, this validation represents a step forward to the systematic and methodical data collection from usersâ€™ self-reported opinions. The reliability results show weak ICC values (ICC = 0.36), while the percentage of agreement is satisfactory (76.67%). A possible explanation for the low ICC values is the fact that SUS has inverse items, one is in the positive sense and the next one is in the negative, alternately. The reason why the author constructed the scale with alternated items was to avoid response biases, especially as the questionnaire invites rapid responses by being short. By alternating positive and negative statements, the goals of the author were to have respondents read each statement and make an effort to think whether they agreed or disagreed with it [11]. However, the insights produced reveal that in the case of this study, this may have been a disadvantage, as it may have induced filling errors when using this scale. The sample used in this study is not, probably, used to fill this kind of instruments, and the fact that the participants needs to have to decide if they agree or disagree with a positive sentence, followed by a negative one, and may effectively induce mistakes as it is complex logic reasoning. In fact it is not the first time that this problem is mentioned in the literature. Sauro and Lewis [22] found that there were some problems both on the part of users in responding to questions and of researchers in scoring the questionnaires. They developed an â€œall-positiveâ€� version of SUS that they suggested addressed these problems without affecting the validity of SUS. Considering the percentage of agreement (76.67%) the Portuguese version of SUS can be used to distinguish between usable and non-usable applications. However, having in consideration the low reliability values (ICC = 0.36), the authors intend to validate the â€œpositiveâ€� version of SUS in this population and repeat this study with a larger sample size.

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used self-administered instrument for the evaluation of usability of a wide range of products and user interfaces. The principal value of the SUS is that it provides a single reference score for participants’ view of the usability of a product or service. This paper presents the translation, cultural adaptation and a contribution to the validation of the European Portuguese version of SUS. The conducted work comprised two phases, the scale translation, and the scale validation. The first phase resulted in a European Portuguese version equivalent to the original in terms of semantic and content. The second phase involved the assessment of the validity and reliability of the scale. The instrument has construct validity as it presents a high and significant correlation with other two usability metrics, the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) (r = 0.70) and a general usability question (r = 0.48). The reliability results show less than satisfactory ICC values (ICC = 0.36), however the percentage of agreement is satisfactory (76.67%). Further studies are needed to investigate the reliability of the Portuguese version. Keywords System Usability Scale European Portuguese validation usability evaluation user tests References [1] M.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license Peer-review under responsibility of SciKA - Association for Promotion and Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge 660 Sandro Carvalho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 659 â€“ 665 for the management of information related to the provision of formal and informal care, derived from both the health and the social context. This ensures the configuration of information capture forms and their presentation, encompassing also primitives for the persistence of the resulting information. The persistence of information is based on the openEHR framework(1), which was developed considering the requirements of formal health care (ie, Electronic Health Records - EHR). Therefore, this study shows the application of the openEHR to persist not only health care information, but also information related to social assistance and informal care. In addition to this introductory section, the article consists of more six sections: Related Work; Platform of Services; Implementation; Development of a Complete Application; Proof of Concept; and Conclusions. 2. Related Work In general, there is a fairly limited view of user needs and, in particular, elderly people are often characterized as simply frail or disabled, with the risk of focusing too much on their incapacities and functional impairments. Therefore, a significant percentage of typical ehealth applications consists in monitoring health conditions or the progress of some illness, namely chronic diseases. Clearly, the complexity of personal needs, as they can be observed in real life settings, is a limiting factor when it comes to deriving requirements on information technologies to support older people. Sixsmith and colleagues(2) have developed an ecological model for guiding research that focuses on practical aspects of everyday living, highlighting opportunities for technology to support activities of daily living. The model is based on the assumption that the activities that make up a person's everyday life are shaped by a range of different factors, including individual factors (eg, functional ability, cognitive ability or psychological characteristics), the person's immediate environment (eg, support networks, social networks, accommodation, or living circumstances) and the wider sociocultural context. These factors then interact in an ecological relationship to facilitate or constrain an individual's activity. In this ecological approach, assistive devices and human services interactively work together to express potentials from both sides, providing high quality services to the people in need. In particular, the technological solutions can contribute to the optimization of support services, given the need of organizing and managing the different healthcare and social assistance services, and informal care provision, in order to maximize them in terms of quality, access, effectiveness and satisfaction of patients. The use of technological solutions have a significant importance in providing information services to mediate interactions among the different actors that build functional care around the care receiver. This approach has been proposed by various authors, based on different technologies, including the management of chronic diseases(3,4). Furthermore, through innovative monitoring devices, there is a considerable effort to develop suitable services to manage psychosocial information, information generated by the care receivers and their informal caregivers, and information resulting from automatic data gathering about individuals and their environments. Despite all these developments, most of the times dedicated database solutions are being used to persist this information, without considering the available standards for semantic interoperability (eg(3,5)). 3. Platform of Services The study proposed in this paper was supported by a Platform of Services, designed to provide mechanisms to facilitate the persistence of the information associated with care provision in the community, in particular social care provision. In order to do that, in addition to the information storage capacity, the Platform of Service provides communication services with external data sources using standard protocols (eg, the HL7) and interfaces with different types of monitoring devices. A key element of the Platform of Services is the Information Persistence Service (IPS). Additionally, there are Authentication, Security and Support Services, namely a set of services that provide important features for applications that use the Platform of Services, including a Version and Update Control Service, Audit, Terminology, or Encryption. Furthermore, the Platform of Services also has an Applications Building Ecosystem (ABE), which allows the creation of complete applications. The IPS has been developed to provide flexibility in terms of information objects. Actually, the persistence services need to react quickly and appropriately to the requirements change, which means that add a new functionality should be possible with minimal risk. This way, it is a solution targeted to the problem in question and 661 Sandro Carvalho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 659 â€“ 665 not to the technologies involved. Therefore, the Persistence Model highlights the possibility of separation between the Storage Model and the Knowledge Model. The Knowledge Model consists of information structures based on the concepts of archetype and template defined in openEHR(1). In this standard, archetypes are governed by an Archetype Object Model (AOM)(1), which describes their structure and semantics. They are created using an Archetype Definition Language (ADL)(1), although the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are also options to take into account for this purpose. In turn, the templates use archetypes as reusable components to build more complex structures, typically already associated with the needs of a given application. These structures are governed by a Template Object Model (TOM). It should be noted that the template concept is used by the authors in a slightly different way from which they have in openEHR. In fact, in the openEHR a template is already associated in a way to a submit form, something that is not the case here, where it is a top-level structure that groups archetypeâ€™s information, without being connected to the presentation of these information, only to its structure. In addition, the IPS provides a set of features to support the applications, enabling them to storage and access to their information in a standardized and contextualized way, always ensuring data security. These features are accessed through an Application Programming Interface (API). In turn, the ABE includes a set of services and tools that enable the creation of complete applications. This allows the definition of the desired characteristics for an application, as well as its information model and associated persistence. These features are used to shape, automatically, a predefined application, generating then the desired code. Verily, to be able to comply with certain requirements for the generated applications, particularly in terms of adaptability and flexibility, it was decided that they should be based on a solid structure, capable to provide the general features of an application, being the graphical components associated with the templates created for the information model at runtime Thus, the diversity of services provided, and especially the existing capability of interaction between them, enables a manager to define the requirements wanted for their application (the business, information and presentation models, as well as the services to incorporate in the application). In short, the Platform of Services provides a way to automatically generate an application according to the manager needs but, at the same time, able to communicate and interoperate (especially in semantic terms) with existing or future applications. 4. Implementation For the implementation of the Platform of Services it was selected an Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach, because it allows the business processes to have a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, making possible the development of new services from an aggregation of components that can run on different platforms, using different operating systems and/or programming languages. Other advantages of reusing existing services and components include reduced design, development, test and implementation time, allowing the construction of configurable solutions by the user(6). At the IPS level, the storage implementation was based on a non-relational solution (commonly known as NoSQL). The NoSQL solutions, as opposed to relational databases, provide different storage mechanisms and data recovery (eg, documents, graphics, key figures, objects or tables). Its advantages include the simplicity of design, availability, scalability and better control. The NoSQL solutions begin to have a significant and growing use in industry, where large amounts of data are used, being the data access done throughout web applications in real time. The features provided in IPS were implemented through web services, which are orchestrated by processes defined in Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). In turn, the ABE implementation was based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This architecture defends the separation of tasks in three layers: model, view and controller. The model contains access to application data, business rules, logic and functions, while the views are the presentation of the application to the users, working both as an access and a return point. Mediation between the views and the model is made through the controllers, who \"interpret\" the entries received through the views and perform the necessary changes in the model, expressing, subsequently, these changes in the corresponding views. The use of the MVC architecture is advantageous because it facilitates the code reuse, maintenance, and addiction of new resources, presenting a scalable character with a high degree of portability. It allows the existence 662 Sandro Carvalho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 659 â€“ 665 of multiple views for the same model so, several systems can be tested over the original model without the need to stop the main system, which allows new functions to be easily added to the applications. In terms of the ABE implementation, three essential tools were considered for the development of new applications: Archetypes Editor; Templates Editor; and Application Forms Editor. These tools were implemented as web applications, being available to be used by the managers of applications. The general model (Application Base), which is the basis for all applications generated from the ABE, was implemented, such as the ABE itself, using the MVC architecture. Its business model was built through domain classes and the interaction between them held by the controllers. Its graphical parts were defined through views. 5. Development of a Complete Application Building an application using the ABE involves a number of steps, starting with the definition of its requirements. After that, the process is automatic and culminates with the creation of the actual code of the application.The ABE provides a range of mechanisms for setting the requirements needed of each application, in order to generate applications in accordance with the desired characteristics. Fig. 1 shows the steps needed for the requirements collection. In fact, the requirements definition is the key point to create an application that meets the business concerns. This process begins, after authentication, with the selection of the area to which the application is intended to belong, something relevant because each area should define general repositories for the information structures that suit their particular needs. Thus, the selection of an area allows direct access to these structures, whose content are already well adapted to the context of activity in cause. On the other hand, the application type definition allows the provision of constructs, templates, application forms and views, oriented for the specific types of applications such as, for example, applications to record information related to the provision of care. The next step is the definition of the information model using the tools which, in turn, use the features offered by the IPS to build repositories for the information storage, as well as for the accommodation of all the information structures that constitute the applicationâ€™s information model. Finally, after the construction of the information model that will support the defined application, itâ€™s time to select the features to be inserted in the application. It should be noted that despite the selection of the area and the application type target to a certain application standard, the access to services and information from other areas is not compromised by this, so the manager can select other types of services than those commonly found in typified applications. Fig. 1. Definition of the Application Requirements. 663 Sandro Carvalho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 659 â€“ 665 The steps that follow the definition of the necessary characteristics for the application are automatic. Indeed, starting from a general core (common to all applications), that is defined and encapsulated in the form of a plugin, the extensions will be made to it in order to meet the application requirements. The code extensions include: i) the connection to IPS, more properly to the repositories created specifically for the application when defining their requirements (in the ABE), which contains the selected archetypes and templates; ii) custom domain classes from standard source scripts, previously defined and tailored; iii) classes that implement user-requested services through the ABE; iv) interface classes to support the services that may eventually be implemented; v) forms to support the business, ie, standard forms that can be adapted to a specific scenario. The extensions to the source code can be seen as the instantiation of the Core Application to incorporate the desired features. This instantiation involves inserting metadata featuring the final application characteristics and making the connections to external modules. This process is followed by the instantiation of objects at runtime, in order to meet the defined features. This step has to do with non-structural adaptations, being more specific and customized settings. Finally, it is necessary to make a new instantiation of the generated application. 6. Proof of Concept To validate the Platform of Services we considered the needs of Social Solidarity Institutions (SSI), in particular those associated with home care services. The SSI can have a cross-activity (eg, health, education, vocational training or social housing) and many of them include in its objectives the protection of old and disabled individuals. This protection goes either by institutionalization or by the provision of home care services. The home care services include the provision of individualized care at home of people who, because of illness, disability or other impediment, cannot ensure, temporarily or permanently, their basic needs or activities of daily living. This includes health services, such as rehabilitation or nursing care, and support services, such as meal preparation, hygiene, comfort or domestic activities, communication, mobility or transport. Due to the complexity of home care services, the SSI require applications to support the management of information associated with the services provided. In particular, the existence of an Electronic Social Record (ESR) is important, which should include information created by the care providers, but also data provided by the users themselves and/or from monitoring devices, for example, associated with tele-alarm systems. The formalization of the type of information required for the operation of a home care service was supported in a study by QueirÃ³s(7), which allowed to identify different categories of objects: i) administrative objects (eg, authorizations management); ii) demographic information (eg, personal information or family members contact); iii) information provided by the user (eg, objects associated with a Personal Health Record - PHR); iv) health conditions; v) information related to the autonomy and independence (eg, daily activities that are capable of performing in an autonomous way and others who need help), habits (eg, eat or sleep habits) and social participation; vi) context (eg, issues related to support networks or living conditions); vii) provision of care (eg, information on medicines and prescriptions or risk factors); viii) documentation, including objects for scheduling appointments, daily notes, health plans (ie, the description of interventions scheduled during the day), activities performed, remote monitoring data devices, and unforeseen events (ie, unplanned interventions). For the implementation of the different objects of information is necessary to define the corresponding archetypes and, based on these archetypes, use the facilities provided by the IPS and the ABE to, respectively, ensure the persistence of information and create forms for the userâ€™s interaction. The following subsections illustrate the implementation of an information object associated with the Barthel scale, an important tool for obtaining information about the dependency of the patients in the execution of their daily tasks. The Barthel scale is already structured as an archetype available in the openEHR website and can be imported by the Archetypes Editor created. Through the Archetypes Editor we also defined an archetype, to which he gave the name of \"DiaryClassification\", that allows the user to rank their day on a scale that goes from 1 to 5 (1 represents a \"very bad\" day and 5 an \"excellent\" day). Having the necessary archetypes to implement the information model for a component of an ESR application, we built a template to group these archetypes and form the structure of the form for entering information in the application. This process was performed using the designed Templates Editor. From the template, and using the Application Form Editor (called â€œAppForGenâ€�), it was possible to generate the application form for entering information. The generated form (Fig. 2) was automatically integrated into the 664 Sandro Carvalho et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 659 â€“ 665 application created by ABE, forming the basis of its information model. Fig. 2. A component of an ESR application and the respective information object. 7. Conclusion The methodology presented was applied to other information objects identified as necessary to home care services. This allowed us to conclude that openEHR framework can be used to support the persistence of information related to formal social assistance services and also to the provision of informal care, which is the main conclusion of the study. Another conclusion is that the Platform of Services can support the implementation of ESR, making possible to configure it to the specific needs of each institution and be changed over the time, without implying modifications in the structures of databases and manual implementation of new programming code. Obviously, the concerns of the authors were focused on the creation of the interaction forms and mechanisms for the persistence of information from the archetypes and templates. To complete ABE is still necessary, as future work, mechanisms for automatic creation of workflows, ie, to integrate the different components, in terms of forms and persistence of information, into a single application with well-defined business rules. The use of business languages such as BPEL will have to be reconciled with the parsing of local interfaces in order to establish the correct flows for applications, allowing, for example, the inclusion of services outside the logic application. Since we want to allow the access to information not only for formal caregivers but also to care receivers and their informal caregivers, the establishment of a pilot can be a unique opportunity to develop mechanisms to integrate the information provided by formal and informal caregivers and allow reasonable accommodation to individual choices. It can also enable the implementation of applications that support efficiently teamwork, involving both formal and informal caregivers, and the study of how to overcome the difficulties resulting from low levels of digital literacy, which is a big problem considering the target users. The establishment of a pilot can also help to detect the improvements to be made to the ABE and the other components of the Platform of Services. References 1. Beale T, Heard S.

The aging of population worldwide leads to the emergence of new needs with regard to the provision of care, including continuity and integration of care. Obtaining a holistic view of the users, and have access to this information on the place and time it is needed, is a key aspect to achieve an improvement in care activities. In this paper we propose a Platform of Services to support and build complex applications for the registration of information, which should enable the integration of health care and social assistance.

Introduction Usability assessment is an important part of the overall development of user interaction mechanisms, which consist of interactive cycles of design, prototyping and validation1. The development processes should not only focus on adherence to technical and functional specifications in order to guarantee a broad acceptance of the results2. Introducing user centered methods ensures that \"real products can be used by real people to achieve their tasks in the real world\"3. There are a variety of usability assessment methods for all stages of design and development of products and services based on information technologies (IT), from the specification to the final design adjustments4. Certain methods rely on usability experts (e.g. inspection methods) while others obtain data from real users (e.g. test or inquiry methods)5,6. Questionnaires and scales are the most common inquiry methods5,6. Several questionnaires and scales were developed and have been used in the assessment of IT based products and services, as their application is fast and inexpensive and allows the collection of large amounts of data. Examples of existing general purpose usability questionnaires and scales are the System Usability Scale (SUS)7 and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ)8. The individual needs, as they can be observed in real life settings, are clearly complex. In particular, user interaction is influenced by a wide range of factors distributed across different levels of impact that interact with each other continuously and in subtle ways9. These include personal, behavioral, social and environmental factors. Sixsmith and colleagues10 developed an ecological model for guiding user research of services supporting individuals with dementia that focuses on practical aspects of everyday living, and highlights opportunities for technology and design to support activities of daily living. The model is based on the assumption that the activities that make up everyday life of an individual are shaped by a range of different factors, including personal factors (e.g. functional ability, cognitive ability or psychological characteristics), the individual's immediate environment (e.g. support networks, social networks, accommodation and living circumstances) and the wider sociocultural context. These factors then interact in an ecological relationship to facilitate or constrain individualâ€™s activities. An ecological approach is useful to consolidate the requirements of older adults, because it highlights the impact and experience of age-related changes in context, and allows for exploration of how this affects everyday life. Contextual factors11 are an important aspect to be addressed when designing and evaluating user interaction mechanisms. Therefore, similarly to aforementioned work10, the authors have been developing a comprehensive framework for the design, development and evaluation of ambient assisted living products and services for older adults12,13, based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)14. The endorsement of the ICF by the World Health Organization (WHO) has promoted a paradigm shift in the way health and disability are understood and measured15. The ICF describes the positive and negative aspects of the interaction between each individual (with a specific health condition) and the respective contextual factors (i.e. environmental and personal factors). The general objective of ICF is to provide a unified and standardized terminology as well as a conceptual model for the description of health and health-related states. The ICF is a hierarchical classification based on the perspective of the body, individual and society, organized in two parts: functioning and disability, and contextual factors. Each part is also subdivided into two components. The first part, functioning and disability, includes body functions and structures, activities and participation. The second part, contextual factors, is divided into personal factors and environmental factors14. The ICF model allows a complete and multidisciplinary approach focused on the individual16 and, additionally, replaces the negative focus of impairment and disability, by a neutral perspective embracing all components that promote or hinder the execution of specific functions, both biological and social17. With this paradigm shift, the disease is no longer seen as the only responsible for disability and impairments, but as one of the factors influencing health, such as environmental factors, social and personal factors18. According to ICF, functioning indicates the positive aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a particular health condition) and the contextual factors (i.e. environmental and personal factors)14. On the opposite, and in a negative perspective, disability is the generic term for disabilities, limitations in activity and restrictions in participation. Furthermore, the interaction between health conditions, individuals and the surrounding environment assumes a great importance11. The environment is crucial for the attenuation or elimination of the disability caused 134 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 132 â€“ 139 by injuries that occur as a result of adverse health conditions. According to ICF, an environmental factor is classified as a facilitator if contributes to increase performance and participation of the individual. On the other hand, if an environmental factor restricts individual's performance and participation, then it is classified as a barrier. Different environments can have a distinct impact on the same individual with a specific health condition. An environment with barriers restricts the individual's performance and, on the other hand, environments with facilitators improve the individual's functioning14. For example, barriers to mobility in the home context (e.g. stairs) may limit the individual's abilities to carry out activities. The same happens with the mobility barriers in the community context (e.g. irregular sidewalks) that may limit the involvement in community activities19. Conversely, products to support mobility (e.g. canes and wheelchairs) may enhance the individual's participation in daily activities by providing physical assistance in performing specific tasks. Similarly, transport facilitators (e.g. availability of a car or public transport) can enable greater participation in community activities19. This is an inclusive and universal perspective that favors all individuals, whether they have a limitation or not20,21. Because there are IT based products and services that intent to change the individual's surrounding environments, in order to improve the individual's activities and participation22, they should be considered as environmental factors according to ICF. In fact, if the individuals are surrounded with products and services tailored to their characteristics, they will be able to reach a higher level of functioning. Therefore, ICF can support a holistic approach to characterize users, theirs contexts, activities and participation13 and for the evaluation of the impact of the environmental factors, namely the usability of IT based products and services. In this context, the authors proposed the development of the ICF based Usability Scale (ICF-US), whose development process, including the definition and the validation phases, is presented in this paper. The paper, in addition to this introductory section, comprises three more sections: Methodology, Results, and Discussion and Conclusions. 2. Methodology The methodology that has been followed comprised two different phases: the scale definition (phase I) and the scale validation (phase 2). 2.1. Phase I - Scale Definition The definition process of the ICF-US was performed according to international guidelines23 and involved the following steps (Figure 1): â€¢ A literature review on validated usability questionnaires and scales was performed to assess the type and content of the questions being used. The review also considered usability principles which allowed the systematization of the following principles: use easiness, satisfaction, learning easiness, efficacy, coherence, flexibility and familiarity, responsiveness, visibility of the feedback and clarity of the feedback. â€¢ The construction of the scale was performed by three researchers that analyzed the results of the literature review. This allowed the definition of the first version of the ICF-US, which was composed by 10 items and a answer key combining barriers and facilitators, according to a numerical scale from -3 to 3. â€¢ The content validation was evaluated by experts in the area of usability that analyzed the first version of the ICF-US aiming to ensure that it measures what is intended to. Each expert classified the different items as unnecessary, useful but not essential, useful or essential. â€¢ The preliminary version of the scale was subjected to a pilot test with a small number of participants from the general population and the data collected was used to refine the instrument, in order to obtain its final version. The complete process took four months, from February until May, 2013. 135 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 132 â€“ 139 Figure 1. Scale definition workflow. 2.2. Phase II - Scale Validation For the scale validation, an observational study was performed in a church-sponsored charity institution, the Santa Casa da MisericÃ³rdia de Oliveira do Bairro. The reliability and validity of the ICF-US was based on real data collection. This process consisted of a usability assessment of a usability assessment of a web based agenda. The usability of the application was evaluated with ICF-US and another two usability scales, SUS and PSSUQ, that were validated for European Portuguese, together with a gold standard question. The observational study took place between November, 2013, and February, 2014, and comprised two sessions separated by 2 to 4 weeks for each participant. The sessions consisted of four parts: â€¢ Introduction â€“ The evaluator applied a social demographic questionnaire (in the first session of each participant) and delivered the session script, explaining orally all information contained therein. â€¢ Test â€“ The participant performed the tasks described in the session script. â€¢ Usability assessment instruments â€“ The evaluator assisted the participant filling the ICF-US, SUS and PSSUQ instruments, as well as to answer the gold standard question. â€¢ Summary â€“ The evaluator thanked the contribution of the participant and, if necessary, scheduled another session. Before data collection a request of study approval was directed to the administration of the Santa Casa da MisericÃ³rdia de Oliveira do Bairro. All adults able to fill in the instruments used in this usability assessment were eligible to participate if they gave written informed consent. The participants received all the information regarding the study and their participation before signing the informed consent. 2.3. Data Analysis To describe and characterize the participants that constitute the population sample, central tendency and dispersion measures were used, including mean, range and standard deviation. The reliability and construct validity were analyzed. Construct validity is the degree to which a test measures what it claims, or purposes, to be measuring. For the reliability analysis the ICF-US was applied twice under similar conditions to each participant with a 2 to 4 weeks interval. The inter-rater reliability was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), which varies between 0 and 1, and is considered: weak (ICC < 0.4), satisfactory (0.4 â‰¤ ICC < 0.75), and very good (ICC â‰¥ 0.75)24. The correlation between the ICF and the remaining scales was assessed by a Spearman correlation coefficient. The level of significance was set at p < 0.01. Statistical analyzes were performed with SPSS - Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago). 136 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 132 â€“ 139 3. Results 3.1. Phase I - Scale Definition The literature review and the construction of the instrument resulted in a 10-item scale. Table 1 shows all the items of the scale. Table 1. ICF-US items. Como classificaria a aplicaÃ§Ã£o quanto: (How would you rate the application regarding:) Ã€ facilidade de utilizaÃ§Ã£o (Ease of use). Ao grau de satisfaÃ§Ã£o com a sua utilizaÃ§Ã£o (The satisfaction with its use). Ã€ facilidade de aprendizagem (the learning easiness). Ã€ obtenÃ§Ã£o dos resultados esperados (The achievement of expected results). Ã€ semelhanÃ§a da forma de funcionamento nas diferentes tarefas (The similarity in the operation mode in the different tasks). Ã€ possibilidade de interagir de vÃ¡rias formas (The possibility to interact in various ways). Ao entendimento das mensagens apresentadas (The understanding of the messages presented). Ã€s respostas da aplicaÃ§Ã£o Ã s suas aÃ§Ãµes (The application responses to your actions). Ao saber o que estava a acontecer na aplicaÃ§Ã£o durante a sua utilizaÃ§Ã£o (The knowledge of what was happening in the application during the utilization). Globalmente, considero que a aplicaÃ§Ã£o foi... (Overall, I consider that the application wasâ€¦) This ICF-US allows the assessment of the aforementioned usability principles (i.e. use easiness, satisfaction, learning easiness, efficacy, coherence, flexibility, familiarity, responsiveness, clarity of the feedback and visibility of the feedback). The answer key of the scale was adapted from the first qualifier of the ICF environmental factors (i.e. barriers and facilitators). Therefore, each item is classified as a barrier or a facilitator. Since the user must take a positive or negative position for each item, the neutral qualifier was removed from the answer key (Table 2). The experts agreed that a graduation of -3 barrier to a +3 facilitator would be the most appropriate, making it easier for the user to position among small, medium or large barrier or facilitator. Table 2. Answer key. Barrier Facilitator Big -3 Medium -2 Small -1 Small 1 Medium 2 Big 3 The content validation was performed by 7 usability experts that analyzed the first version of the ICF-US. In general, questions were classified as essential or useful; however four items were considered unclear by the experts. To address this issue, some examples were added to each one of the four questions. For example, the item â€œComo classificaria a aplicaÃ§Ã£o quanto Ã possibilidade de interagir de vÃ¡rias formasâ€� (in English, â€œHow would you rate the application regarding the possibility to interact in many waysâ€�) was completed with â€œpor exemplo, teclado, toque ou vozâ€� (in English, â€œfor example, keyboard, touch or speechâ€�). The examples are intended to enhance the understanding of each item. Table 3 shows the English translation of the problematic items and the examples that were added to facilitate the comprehension and understanding of these items. Table 3. Problematic items and the examples added. Original Item Example added The achievement of expected results. For example, I wanted to write a text and managed to do it. The similarity in the operation mode in the different tasks. For example, the way I confirm an action is always the same. The possibility to interact in various ways. For example, keyboard, touch or speech. The understanding of the messages presented. For example, written or audio messages. 137 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 132 â€“ 139 The new version of the scale was used in a pilot test with 4 participants from the general population in order to ensure the correct formulation of questions and the appropriateness of the content, the comprehensibility of the language, the sequence of the questions and the adequacy of the presentation format being used. The data collected was used to refine the instrument and build the final version. Concerning the version, the questions and examples were considered easy to understand. 3.2. Phase II - Scale Validation For the observatory study, the sample was selected according to the following inclusion criteria: age over 18 years, ability to read, understand and sign the informed consent. The only exclusion criterion was the presence of limitation on the upper limb movements because this could affect the interaction with the web application used to validate the ICF-US. The sample consisted of 32 participants with a mean age of 47 years (DP = 14.6). The sample was mostly female (87.5%). The characterization of the sample is described in Table 4. Table 4. Sample characterization. Participants 32 Gender n (%) Female 28 (87.5) Male 4 (12.5) Age Mean (DP) 47 (14.6) Min - Max 20 â€“ 84 Table 5 presents the number of participants that completed each scale in both the first and second sessions. Table 5. Number of participants that completed the scales. The ICC value was 0.46 which indicates a satisfactory inter-rater reliability (CI 95% - 0.10; 0.71). The correlation between the ICF-US and the remaining scales was assessed by the Spearman correlation coefficient (Table 6) that indicates a higher correlation between the ICF-US and PSSUQ (r = 0.84) than between ICF-US and SUS (r = 0.68). Table 6. Correlation between the ICF-US and the remaining scales. SUS (Total) PSSUQ (Total) Gold Standard ICF-US 0.68a 0.84a 0.84a a P < 0.01 4. Discussion and Conclusions This study contributes to the application of the ICF by using its concepts and terminology to create a generic usability assessment scale. The observational study that was performed and the analysis of the results, including the comparison of ICF-US with SUS and PSSUQ, allows the authors to conclude the validity and reliability of ICF-US. Since ICF-US is a generic usability scale it can be used regardless the specific characteristics of the products or services. n First Session n Second Session SUS 31 31 PSSUQ 29 31 ICF-US 28 31 Gold Standard 31 31 138 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 67 ( 2015 ) 132 â€“ 139 When the ICF-US was compared with SUS and PSSUQ, it was verified that there is a correlation between the ICF-US and PSSUQ (r = 0.86) (p < 0.01), and between ICF-US and SUS (r = 0.68) (p < 0.01). These correlations suggest that the three scales evaluate the same construct and, therefore, ICF-US is valid when compared to both SUS and PSSUQ. Surprisingly, the Spearman correlation coefficient is lower for the first comparison (ICF-US versus SUS). This is an unexpected result because both SUS and PSSUQ are already established scales. A possible explanation for this fact is that SUS has inverse items, one is in the positive sense and the next one is in the negative, alternately, and this may have induced filling errors when individuals with low literacy using this scale. The results suggest acceptable reliability and validity values for the ICF-US indicating that this instrument may be a useful tool for the usability assessment of IT based products and services. The main advantage of using this scale instead of other usability scales is the fact that it is based on a conceptual model that is supported by concepts and terminologies established by WHO, which means that are universally accepted. This can facilitate a clear understanding of what are barriers or facilitators, as well as the consolidation of knowledge, which is essential for strategic planners, technological innovators, care providers and users involved in the design and development of IT based products and services. The translation of the ICF-US to English is being considered as future work. Furthermore, another study is being performed to define and evaluate the ICF based Usability Scale II (ICF-US II). The main goal of this second scale is to gather additional information in order to understand what should be modified (barriers) and what should be established as a good practices (facilitators)13,25,26. The ICF-US and the ICF-US II are part of a comprehensive framework for the design, development and evaluation of ambient assisted living products and services for older adults12,13,27. Furthermore, in future, the authors also intend to evaluate if the use of the ICF terminology may facilitate the communication between the multidisciplinary teams involved in the development of new products and services.

Questionnaires and scales are valuable instruments to collect large amounts of subjective data from users and their application is a reliable technique to assess usability. Furthermore, when considering products and services for older adults, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) might be used as a conceptual model for usability assessment. This paper presents the development and validation of the ICF-Usability Scale (ICF-US), an instrument supported by concepts and terminologies related to ICF and that is part of a comprehensive framework for the design, development and evaluation of ambient assisted living products and services for older adults. The methodology that has been followed in the study reported by this paper comprises two phases: the development and the validation phases. The last phase consisted in an observational study performed in a nursing home involving 32 adults and its results suggest acceptable reliability and validity values for the ICF-US.

This paper introduces some results of the AAL4ALL project, as an approach to the provision of assistance and health care services (ie, AAL@MEO) using the commercial Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) deployment of the Portugal Telecom MEO service. First, we present the related work. Then, we introduce the methodological approach and we present the results of a prototype testing with real users. Finally, we present some concluding remarks. 2. Related Work The recent developments related to smart components highly integrated and miniaturized(4) together with the existing ubiquitous communication networks make transfer and access of health-related information such as measurement data or medical knowledge possible anywhere and at any time. Therefore, the advances on sensing and communication technologies make it possible to develop mobile and wearable sensors able to continuously monitor physiological parameters, activities and behaviours in out-hospital conditions. Monitoring physiological parameters, together with monitoring daily activities (ie, identifying consistency and completeness in these activities), to assess, in a naturalistic and continuous way, health and cognitive status(5,6) might help to automate assistance and prevent accidents or disease exacerbations. Concerning emergency situations, monitoring patients and providing alerts to health care providers might facilitate a prompt intervention. In this respect, pervasive health applications might improve access to care, particularly when time is vital (eg, in stroke or acute trauma). These systems are based, in most cases, on solutions designed to solve specific problems related to specific care process and specific patient situations(7-12), which means that users need to acquire skills and abilities to interact with a broad range of systems deployed at home. In this respect the use of a TV set at home as the central interaction and communication system is advantageous(13-14). 3. Methodology The development methodology of the AAL@MEO, an interactive TV application for remote care services, was based on a series of procedures that go from the analysis of system requirements to the final evaluation of systems or services (prototype and pilot tests). The AAL@MEO application was the result of an in-depth requirements analysis and a conceptual validation involving several stakeholders(15). The study reported in this paper is related to the usability evaluation of the AAL@MEO prototype. The AAL@MEO prototype was evaluated in terms of usability(16) by an observational study. This study took place between July 22th and December 3rd, 2014. Each session consisted of four parts: i) Introduction â€“ The investigator applied a social and demographic questionnaire and then delivered the session script, explaining orally all information contained therein; ii) Test â€“ The participant performed the tasks described in the session script and the investigator collected data on the user interaction with the AAL@MEO; iii) Usability Evaluation Instruments â€“ The investigator assisted the participant when filling in the usability questionnaires and scales; and iv) Summary â€“ The investigator thanked the participant. All adults able to fill in the instruments were eligible to participate if they gave written informed consent. The only exclusion criterion was the presence of limitation on the fine upper limb movements. All data collection was anonymized and the involved participants received all the information regarding the study and their participation before completing the informed consent. Additionally, the written informed consent was obtained prior to data collection. A request of approval was directed to the administration of the Santa Casa da MisericÃ³rdia de Aveiro (SCMA), a church-sponsored charity institution. 637 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 3.1. Instruments The instruments used to evaluate ALL@MEO were the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) together with a general usability question, the ICF based Usability Scale I (ICF-US I) and the ICF based Usability Scale II (ICF-US II). The PSSUQ is a usability evaluation questionnaire based on scenarios that was developed by IBM. It consists of 19 items aimed at addressing five usability characteristics of a system: rapid completion of the task, ease of learning, high quality documentation and online information, functional adequacy and rapid acquisition of productivity(17). The results and interpretation of the PSSUQ were performed within the defined parameters of the original scale. Lewis(17) developed the rules to calculate the PSSUQ score and defined a global total score and partial scores for the subscales associated with PSSUQ: i) Global: average of the responses from items 1 to 19; ii) System Utility (SysUse): average of the responses from items 1 to 8; iii) Quality of information (InfoQual): average of the responses from items 9 to 15; and iv) Interface Quality (IntQual): average of the responses from items 16-18. The final score of PSSUQ is calculated by the average of the scores of the items and the scores of the subscales. Higher scores are associated with better usability. If a participant fails to respond an item or classifies it as not applicable, then that item should be replaced by the average score of the remaining items. Another evaluation tool that reflects the usersâ€™ opinion is the general usability question: \"Overall how would you rate the application on a scale from 0 to 10?â€�. This question was based on the After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) developed by Lewis(17) and is accompanied by a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, in order to facilitate the completion of the question, and 0 represents the worst possible score and 10 the best possible score. In addition to these evaluation measures, two scales that reflect the opinion of the investigators were also used: the ICF-US I and ICF-US II. The ICF-US I allows a comprehensive usability evaluation, while the ICF-US II allows the evaluation of specific components of the application. The two scales allow the identification of barriers and facilitators (small, middle and big barrier or facilitator) and, consequently, the application weaknesses and strengths(18). The ICF-US I scores all items from -3 to 3, which -3 is the less positive and 3 is the most positive response. If a participant fails to respond an item or classify it as not applicable, then it should be replaced by the average of the remaining items, rounded to the units. The final score of the ICF-US I is the sum of all itemsâ€™ score. In addition, the ICF-US II scale is composed of items that identify different application components (eg, menu navigation, image or interaction with the remote control). This scale has three parts: i) the application components; ii) detailed usability; and iii) overall evaluation. Each item is classified as a barrier or a facilitator. Whenever a component is classified as a barrier, the user must identify the characteristic that is causing the component classification as a barrier (e.g. the characters can be considered as barrier due to their size, color or sharpness). Therefore, it is possible to identify which items require more work in order to improve the application(18). Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Office Excel and SPSS - Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago). 3.2. Performance During the test, an investigator recorded data on the execution of each task in a performance evaluation grid. Performance evaluation is a technique centered in the users and the tasks they perform, and involves the collection of quantitative data. For each task included in the script, the following data was recorded: the success or failure in carrying out the task, the execution time (in seconds) and the total number of errors. Statistical analysis of the performance evaluation grid data were performed using Microsoft Office Excel. 3.3. Critical Incidents Record The same investigator that recorded the performance also logged the critical incidents in order to systematically identify behaviors that contribute to the participantsâ€™ success or failure in specific situations. Several details were considered, such as easy/difficult interaction with the application or calmness/restlessness. 638 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 4. Used Technology In Portugal, there are elderly people who feel uncomfortable when using PCs/laptops or Smartphones. The major reasons are the complexity and the small size of characters usually used in those terminals, namely in the small screens like the ones of the Smartphones. On the other hand, a TV set equipment is well known by the elderly population, so that the adaptation to a new application/service is usually more natural. For that reason, the AAL@MEO was developed over the commercial IPTV deployment of the Portugal Telecom MEO service. This allows LiveTV and VoD channels as well as a sort of interactive commercial services related with different IPTV contents, supported over a Mediaroom TV Platform. Furthermore, the development of new applications is supported by a special purpose Application Program Interface known as Presentation Framework (PF). The Fig. 1 presents a screen capture of the AAL@MEO application, which was developed to: x Present information, namely vital signs measurements (eg, blood pressure), weight measurements, or information videos, starting with a general dashboard with a summary of all the information available to the end user. x Receive pop-up in the TV screen with alerts or notifications. x Allow interactions with the end-users for confirmation of the measurements or answering questionnaires related to their physical and psychological state. The use of characters with big size and figures in the several TV screens of the PF application oriented to the elderly population, associated to an easy navigation menu with only five buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right and OK) of the remote control, were the major requirements for this developed TV interface in order to have a friendly service. Fig. 1. Screen capture of the application. 5. Results The sample was selected according to previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (consecutive recruitment). The sample consisted of 30 female collaborators of the SCMA that provide care to elderly people. The average age was 58 years old (SD = 3,3). In terms of education level most participants (n = 12) had the 4th grade, followed by the 7th grade (n = 9), 5th grade (n = 5) and finally the 12th grade (n = 2) and graduation (n = 2). Among the participants, 28 reported to use a mobile phone regularly, 26 of which use a simple mobile phone and 2 use a smartphone. Regarding the computer utilization, only 11 participants have ever used a computer, but very sporadically and with help from a third person. Only 5 participants had already used the commercial MEO service before. Most participants are very satisfied with their ability to perform day-to-day activities (n = 21). With regards to the quality of life, 16 participants considered it reasonable and 11 good. Most participants (n = 18) considered them as having good memory. 639 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 According to the experimental design, the following subsections discuss the results related to: i) PSSUQ and the ICF-US I and II scales; ii) the performance evaluation; and iii) the critical incident analysis. 5.1. Instruments The average score of PSSUQ for all participants was 5,82 out of a maximum of 7 (SD = 1,01), which indicates a high degree of usability and satisfaction. The results for the subscales associated with PSSUQ were: â€¢ System Utility (SysUse): average of the responses from items 1 to 8 = 5,52 (SD = 0,38). â€¢ Quality of information (InfoQual): average of the responses from items 9 to 15 = 5,89 (SD = 0,55). â€¢ Interface Quality (IntQual): average of the responses from items 16-18 = 6,34 (SD = 0,09). In a more detailed analysis, the items that obtained higher scores were \"The interface of this system was pleasant\" (6,43 out of 7) and \"This system has all the functions and capabilities that I expected it to have\" (6.31 out of 7). Both items are related to the interface quality subscale. This is in agreement with the participants expressed satisfaction about the visual part of the application. The items that obtained lower scores were \"Whenever I made a mistake using the system, I could recover easily and quickly\" (4,86 out of 7) and \"I was able to complete the tasks and scenarios using this system\" (4,90 out of 7). Both items are related to the interaction of participant-application. Another evaluation tool that reflects the participantsâ€™ opinion is the general usability items whose average rating was 7,77 out of 10 (SD = 1,74), reinforcing participantsâ€™ satisfaction regarding the application. According to the ICF-US I, the application was considered a facilitator by 19 participants and a barrier by 11 participants. The mean score for all participants was 3,67 (SD = 14,20), out of a range from -30 to 30, indicating that in general the application was a small facilitator. The participant with the highest score had 24, and the participant with the lower score had -22. Reviewing the items individually it is important to classify each one as a barrier or facilitator (see Fig. 2). The barriers, in order of severity, were: \"The ease of use\" (-0,70); \"The similarity of the way it works on different tasks\" (-0,43); \"The ease of learning\" (-0,40); \"The achievement of expected results\" (-0.27); and \"Globally, I consider that the application was\" (-0,10). Analyzing the items identified as barriers, most participants had difficulty in tasks related to interaction, learning, execution and repetition of actions. In turn, the facilitators in order of importance, were: \"The application responses to your actions\" (1,77); \"The understanding of the messages displayed\" (1,63); \"The degree of satisfaction with the utilization of the application\" (1,40); and \"The knowledge of what was happening in the application during its use\" (0,77). By analyzing the items identified as facilitators, it seems that most participants clearly understood the information provided by AAL@MEO. The users were aware of what was happening in the application and were satisfied with it. The item 6: \"The ability to interact in various ways\" was considered not applicable since there was only one form of interaction (via a remote control). The ICF-US II was developed to evaluate the Application components (6 items), Detailed Usability (7 items), Overall Evaluation (1 item). Globally, the application of ICF-US II shows that the application was a facilitator for 20 participants, neutral for 1 and a barrier for 9 participants. The mean of the total scores for all participants was 8,90, in a range of -42 to 42 (SD = 18,31), indicating that in general the application was a small facilitator. The participant with the highest score had a score of 40, and the participant with the lower score had a score of -23. 640 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 Fig. 2. ICF-US I results. The results of the subscales within the ICF-US II were analyzed according to the mean of the items (range -3 to 3): â€¢ Application Components: average of the responses = 0,37 (SD = 2,40); â€¢ Detailed Usability: average of the responses = 1,02 (SD = 2,41); â€¢ Overall Evaluation: average of the responses = -0,47 (SD = 2,01). The barriers, in order of severity, were: \"The evolution graphs in the health menu\" (-1,87); \"Navigation on the horizontal menu\" (-0,90); \"Navigation with the remote control\" (-0,67); \"Measurements confirmation\" (-0,60); \"Navigation on the vertical menu\" (-0,53); \"The application functions\" (-0,50); and \"The session progress\" (-0,47). Analyzing the items identified as a barrier, it seems that most participants had difficulty in tasks related to the navigation in the vertical and horizontal menus, interaction with the remote control and the interpretation of the application behavior. In the other hand, the facilitators were: \"The contrast between the background and the information\" (3,0); \"The font\" (2,97); \"The menu colors\" (2,97); \"The information on the monitor menu\" (1,97); \"The information on the alerts menu\" (1,97); \"Authentication with the ID card\" (1,50); \"Icons/symbols/graphics\" (0,13). Analyzing the items identified as facilitators, it seems that most participants found it easy to understand the information provided by the application interface and authenticating of the system. 5.2. Performance For each task included in the session script, the data recorded was: the success or failure in carrying out the task, the execution time (in seconds) and the total number of errors. The data from the performance evaluation grid is shown in Table 1. The most problematic tasks, with a higher failure and error rate were the tasks 8, 9 and 3. No participant was able to successfully complete Task 8 since it was not clear that swiping to the side it would display the graph of the monthly values and because it was not clear that to return to the previous menu the user should press the OK button in the remote control as Back was selected as default. Task 9, because in the vertical menu (on the left) the items are represented by icons and the participants were not familiar with any of those icons. For that reason they had great difficulty finding out for themselves how to logout. Task 3, because the participants tend to the press OK button to confirm, but in this case, they had to move to the confirm option first and then press OK button. Generally, these Item 1 â€“ The ease of use. Item 2 â€“ The degree of satisfaction with the use. Item 3 â€“ The ease of learning. Item 4 â€“ The achievement of expected results. Item 5 â€“ The similarity of the way it works on different tasks. Item 7 â€“ The understanding of the messages displayed. Item 8 â€“ The application responses to your actions. Item 9 â€“ The knowledge of what was happening in the application during its use. Item 10 â€“ Overall, I consider that the application wasâ€¦ 641 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 were also the tasks that had higher execution times, except for the task 2 and 4, in which the execution time depends on the devices rather than in the difficulty performing the task. Table 1. Performance evaluation results. Tasks Success (nÂº of persons) Average Time (seconds) Number of errors (average) 1 - Authenticate in the system using your ID card and the card reader. 22/8 12,1 0,6 2 - After correct authentication, weigh yourself using the scale. 30/0 75,7 0,1 3 - Using the remote control, confirm the weight. 8/22 21,9 0,8 4 - Using the blood pressure monitor check your blood pressure and pulse rate. 30/0 101,7 0,0 5 - Using the remote control, confirm the blood pressure and pulse measurements. 12/18 24,6 0,8 6 - Enter the menu \"monitor\" and check for alerts (in red).

Critical Incident Analysis In terms of critical incidents, about half of participants showed insecurity and lack of autonomy during the interaction as they constantly seek approval from the investigator in the interaction with the application. Some of the participants (7) had difficulty interacting with the remote control, especially the arrows buttons and must participants reported difficulties browsing the menus (17 participants had difficulties with the horizontal navigation while 13 participants had difficulties with the vertical navigation). These results are consistent with the results of the application of the ICF-US II scale. 6. Conclusion The usability evaluation shows that elderly users have a high degree of satisfaction towards the interaction with the TV set. Despite the results being mostly positive, AAL@MEO presents some usability issues that occurred repeatedly, clearly indicating what features needed to be improved. Early on it was clear the lower computer literacy of the participants which was reflected in the execution of many of the tasks. The application was developed to present information, namely on vital signs (eg, blood pressure), weight, or information videos, starting with a general dashboard with a summary of all information available to a specific end user. According to the proposed solution, the entire control interface is integrated in a TV set. Furthermore, considering the elderly population, characters with big size and figures were used in association with a navigation mechanism with five buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right and OK) of the remote control. However, it is relevant to mention the difficult of using the multiple functions button of the remote control due to the option of using the same type of remote control included in the available MEO service. As the arrows buttons are part of a \"single\" button it was difficult for participants to press the correct option, which had consequences in the navigation using the menus. This implies that the solution being used should be further analyzed. Results suggest that even the commercially available MEO service would benefit with a different type of remote control. The services offered may be dynamically extended through the inclusion of third-party or new services. Having a common access interface based on IPTV allows elderly people to feel safer and have a perception of familiarity and confidence when interacting with new services. 642 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 Acknowledgements This study was funded by Project QREN NÂº 13852 I&D Â«AAL4ALL â€“ Ambient Assisted Living for AllÂ», co- funded by COMPETE and FEDER.

Having a common access interface based on IPTV allows elderly people to feel safer and have a perception of familiarity and confidence when interacting with new services. 642 Vitor SimÃµes Ribeiro et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 635 â€“ 642 Acknowledgements This study was funded by Project QREN NÂº 13852 I&D Â«AAL4ALL â€“ Ambient Assisted Living for AllÂ», co- funded by COMPETE and FEDER.

This paper presents the usability evaluation of the AAL@MEO, an application running in a commercial service of Internet Protocol TV that integrates technological solutions to support home care. The evaluation methodology comprises the application of usability assessment instruments (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and the International Classification of Functioning based Usability Scale), performance tests and analysis of critical incidents. The results show that elderly users had a high degree of satisfaction towards the interaction with the TV set, but some of the interaction mechanisms based on a remote control with multiple functions need further developments.

Introduction The existence of different information systems in clinical setting, as well as multiple imaging modalities and different manufacturers, together with the production of huge volumes of information, makes relevant the development of tools that can be used for the extraction, processing, delivery and analysis of large volumes of data. Such tools can be useful for the professional practice characterization, including through performance indicators definition1, which can be analyzed using dashboards in order to promote productivity, performance and other health care quality improvement initiatives2. This paper aims to demonstrate the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) metadata consolidation feasibility of images stored on a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) archive for the production of indicators with different granularity levels, independently of medical imaging equipment manufacturers and information systems. The experimental study was conducted in a Hospital Center (HC) which resulted from the junction of three Health Care Facilities (HCF_01, HCF_2 and HCF_3). The imaging studies stores in two institutions PACS since 2009 (HCF_01 and HCF_2) were transferred to a central PACS archive installed in May 2011 and belonging to a third institution (HCF_3). The authors used Dicoogle application3 to build an index supported in the DICOM metadata contained in the HC PACS. This index, containing 92.6 GB, allows the information consolidation regarding to 20.595.967 images, bellowing to 467.243 studies, which is useful for retrospective studies. In particular, in this paper will explore the Index results for a macro characterization of the Radiology department who supported the study. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 are addressed some factors with influence in the production of high volumes of information associated with imaging studies and some existing limitations when analyzing the DICOM metadata stored in PACS archives. This section also provides a DICOM metadata indexing methodology, independent of equipment manufacturers and information systems, and its contribution within DICOM metadata mining initiatives. In section 3 is presented the methodology used for indexing and analysis of DICOM metadata existing in the CH PACS archive. In section 4 there are presented the results and in section 5 there are presented the discussion, some conclusions and future work initiatives. 2. Background The existence of inherently digital medical imaging modalities (eg, Computed Tomography - CT, Magnetic Resonance - MR) and the introduction of modalities such as Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DX) at Radiology departments, where they can generate 60-70% of the volume of images produced4 have made clear the need for the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for the daily information management. This led to the use of information systems such as PACS5-7 to access and use of relevant information to the Radiology departmentâ€™s activity. At this level, there has have been developed strategies for a more assertive management of large volume of studies performed daily. These strategies may comprise better definition of studies protocols, but also the optimization of existing PACS systems8, 9. In order to allow different users to create custom searches over the DICOM metadata that is part of the different modalities images, and according to the data that the user want to analyze, there are emerging IT solutions that complement the search functions normally provided by PACS10-15. An IT solution that enables the indexing, extraction and export of images and DICOM metadata, and that seeks to respond to the requirements mentioned above, is the Dicoogle3. The typically PACS Archive Server and Databases are general prepared to take maximum efficiency for clinical usage. Thus, the access to the information that typically are not used by the clinical or diagnosis is not typically implemented in the PACS Archive, or many of them supports the dump of all the DICOM fields in the screen, but they do not support a massive analyses of the field and do a statistical analyses from third party tools. General the 653 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 651 â€“ 658 structure of the database is complex and depends on the manufacture. To tackle the issue, there is a tool called Dicoogle3, free and an open source that allows to easily access to a image archive over the file systems and massive extracts all the DICOM headers from the images. Dicoogle supports not only a powerful system to parse the DICOM headers but they can do it in hard-drives that can be remotely mounted in a local machine 16. On one hand, the process of the data gathering is named as â€œindexingâ€� and it allows to extract all the fields and store them in a data structure that is flexible and portable to move across locations. For instance, it is possible to index multiple locations in the same Dicoogle instance. On another hand, the process of query is really flexible compared with the traditional PACS. For instance, they restricted typically to the DIM (DICOM Information Model) fields, while in Dicoogle is possible to all the fields that contains the image and combine in an advanced and complex boolean query using range of values and wildcards. For instance, Dicoogle will be able to answer: â€œHow many patients have exams to the TORAX with ExposureTime between X and Y?â€�. Moreover, all of the results can be easily exported to an Excel spreadsheet. Finally, they also have an extension to analyze the index and easily extract global statistics, such as quality of the data, image per device and the most used terms in the DICOM fields. These results can be visualized graphically and also exported to a CSV file to be analyzed by third-party tools17. The DICOM metadata indexing process allows DICOM Meta Data Mining initiatives, and can be a very useful information resource for the professional practice characterization in radiology departments. For example, their use for the characterization of the actors involved in the provision of health care, or to analyze the exposure to X-radiation to which patients are subjected during radiological studies18-19, can help to identify situations that can represent a deficit of quality of health care, or can contribute to the definition of continuous quality improvement initiatives18. On the other hand, the DICOM metadata indexing process can occur over files from different modalities and health care facilities PACS archives since it is not dependent on the equipment manufacturer or information systems20. The different imaging modalities (eg, CT or MR) are supported by the DICOM standard for the studies acquisition and management, particularly when using PACS. In general, in these systems the users are always dependent on the provision by the manufacturer from a set of search functions. These are usually limited, that is, we can only use a limited number of DICOM fields for research activities. This promotes screening DICOM data in a standardized and inflexible manner3,15. This situation is mainly due to the fact that PACS do not make available all DICOM fields to support the DICOM Information Model Query & Retrieve (DIM Q / R), which means that a large amount of DICOM information is not searchable16. On the other hand, there is a need for tools and methodologies for the analysis of information produced in radiology department, including DICOM metadata, which can serve to support clinical decision-making and human and material resources management. 3. Material and Methods A retrospective study of the metadata stored in a Hospital PACS archive that stores studies performed in three Health Care institutions was done (HCF_1, HCF_2 and HCF_3). Access to studies stored in the PACS archive was conducted after approval by the ethics committee and the hospital administration. The confidentiality of patients and actors involved in the provision of health care was guaranteed The DICOM metadata indexing process occurred on the PACS archive using Dicoogle installed in a virtual machine bellowing to the Hospital domain and supported by an Intel (R) Xeon (R) E5540 with 2.53 GHz speed processor and 2 GB of RAM. Each of the 17 discs that form the PACS archive was indexed separately and merge in to a global index. The extraction of DICOM metadata was supported by specific queries, supported by the DICOM attributes Institution Name, Modality and Study Date. Data statistical analysis was supported by the statistical Dicoogle plugin22. In this context were analyzed: â€¢ The number of patients with studies, as well as the number of studies and images stored, â€¢ The contribution of each modality to the volume of information produced, â€¢ The contribution of each Health Care facility for the volume of studies stored at the PACS archive. 654 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 651 â€“ 658 4. Results Within the HC, the PACS archive supports the storage of studies from three Health Care facilities (Fig. 1) bellowing to different modalities and conducted in different equipment. In this PACS, the images bellowing to a study are distributed across different disks, which imply having to index all existing records to ensure that all images belonging to a study is indexed. Fig. 1. Central PACS for the three Health Care facilities. At the time of DICOM metadata indexing process, de PACS archive consisted of 17 discs, with a total capacity of 8.626 GB, with 6.707 GB used and 1.934 GB free. The index of 17 disks held for 63 days (from October 6 to December 9, 2014), with an average speed indexing of 3.8 images/s, and resulted in an index of 92.6 GB, containing information on 467.243 studies, bellowing to 162.138 patients and comprising 20.595.967 images. The value of 308,336 patients in Table 1 arises from the fact that many patients went more than once to the Health Care facility between 2009 and 2014. In this table are also presented the queries structures used for the analysis of the number of patients with studies performed and the number of studies and images acquired and stored in different years . Table 1. Number of patients with studies performed per year and the number of studies and images stored at the PACS archive.

However, despite the decrease of the number of patients in 2014 compared to 2013, we see an increasing number of studies and images. 655 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 651 â€“ 658 The number of acquired images has direct implications on storage space management. In this context, the disks that are part of the PACS archive have different levels of use, being noticeable values of about 400 GB (roughly 80%) of space used in most of them. However, there are two disks with lower space utilization (disk S and T with 200 GB) and two disks with fulfillment values slightly below 300 GB (disk U and V). Fig. 2 shows the capacity, used space and free space on each disk indexed. Fig. 2. Used an free space on each disk. The analysis of the contribution of different modalities to the information volume stored, and affecting the values shown in Figure 2, was supported by the queries presented in Table 1. In this context we analyzed the percentage of different values stored in the DICOM attribute â€œModality â€œ. These values range from 95,55% of images from CT modality in 2013 and 0,0% in other modalities such as Mammography (MG), Digital Radiography (DX) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) in some years (Table 2). In Table 2 we see a gradual increase in the percentage of CT and RF images existing in the PACS archive, decreasing in 2014. However, in this year we see a significant increase in MR images (6%) compared to previous years. The percentage of DX images decreases over the years. On the other hand, the percentage of US images gradually increases from 2011. From 2011 the percentage of CR images does not vary. When we look at Table 2 we also verify the existence of residual values of other modalities (eg, Other - OT and Angiography - XA), and values for Structured Reports (SR) and Presentation Layers (PR).

In Table 2 is also clear that there is 6% images belonging to the MR modality, a modality that does not exist at the HC, which could represent an increase in the number of studies conducted outside of CH and whose images were stored in the PACS archive, so it can be relevant to know the health care facility responsible for conducting these 656 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 651 â€“ 658 studies. As a result, we identified 24 names for the outside health care facilities identification (Table 3) as well as 5,9% images with a numeric identification of the health care facility. On the other hand, it was evident the existence of different names to identify the same health care facility. For example, HCF_1 is identified with one designation in 0,07% images, and HCF_2 is identified with 9 different designations in 3,3% images (e.g. Hosp. XPTO, Hosp.xpto, HXPTO). The HCF_03 appears identified in 88,42% images but with 12 different designations. Furthermore, 5,90% images come with numerical values for the health care facility identification (eg, 11003, 11004, 11028). Table 3. Number of the Health Care facility designations and percentage of associated images. External HCF HCF _1 HCF _2 HCF- 3 Hospital Center Unknown (numeric values) Number of different designations (Institution Name DICOM attribute) 24 1 9 12 1 6 % 1,96 0,07 3,30 88,42 0,35 5,90 5. Discussion and Conclusions Most of the information stored in PACS archives was never accessed again by health care providers. However, the retrospective study of DICOM metadata, stored at the PACS archive, can be a very relevant source of information about the health care provision, but also for information management and information quality assessment, especially when the information results from the aggregation of data from different health care facilities. Despite the amount of information in the HC PACS archive, the merger indexing methodology of DICOM metadata stored on multiple disks, and from different health care facilities, was achieved within a time period which represents a considerable computational effort, especially if one takes into account the DICOM metadata indexing speed of 3.8 images/s. The 92.6 GB of data resulting from the indexing process allowed us to know the number of patients from three health care facilities with studies stored in the PACS archive. The DICOM metadata consolidation has provided an overall view of the Radiology department activity. However, the data interpretation should take into account the clinical environment from where they emerge. The definition of queries with specific structures, in accordance with the metadata to be extracted, allowed the collection of the data shown in Table 1. In this table we identified a significant increase in the number of patients, studies and images stored in the PACS archive in 2011 and went up again in 2012. These values result from the fact that the installation of the HCF_3 PACS occurred only on April 2011 and, on the other hand, the fact that only this health care facility have DX and MG modality, and two multi-slice CT equipment, which may explain the significant increase of studies and images stored in the PACS archive after 2011. However, when we analyze the 2014 data, we find that a smaller number of patients is associated with a greater number of studies and images stored (which can be explained by the fact that the indexing process was performed only until December 9). These values can be associated with a smaller number of images acquired in DX modality in 2014 and with an increased number of images in US and MR modalities (Table 2). In fact, the data analysis allow us to identify a decrease in the number of DX modality images associated with an increase of the number of images from US and MR modalities. In Table 2 we also found that in 2009 and 2010 there are no images from some modalities (eg, MG and DX), which is due to the fact that these modalities only exist in HCF_03 from the year 2011. Moreover, we found that a decrease in the number of CT images is associated with an increase in the number of MR images, in a very similar percentage. In this scenario it may be pertinent to study the existence of a cause-effect relationship. The identification of the health care facilities with studies stored in the PACS archive has proved a difficult task due to the poor information quality recorded in the DICOM attribute â€œInstitution Nameâ€�. This reality undermines the implementation of improvement initiatives in a clinical environment using existing resources, where the identification of the actors involved in the provision of health care is very important, starting with the identification of health care facilities. This identification can be diminished by multiple designation of the health care facilities and by the fact that 5,90% images are identified with numeric values. On the other hand, and as 657 Milton Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 64 ( 2015 ) 651 â€“ 658 an example, HCF_1 is uniquely identified in only 0,07% images, which can be associated to the migrating data process between HCF_1 PACS archive and HC PACS archive. The studies integration in HC PACS resulted in the possibility to analyze 8.626 GB of information, which allowed a better understanding of the evolution of the number of studies by the population covered by the three health care facilities. Knowing this reality makes it possible to anticipate hardware and software requirements that contribute to the proper management of information, including storage needs, or to the definition of strategies that result in optimizing performance, namely by optimizing studies protocols, particularly in the CT modality context. In fact, this modality comes to be responsible for over 95% of the information stored in the PACS archive (Table 2), aspect which may be associated with a large number of studies but also the use of multislice CT equipment and the inappropriate use of multiplanar image reformatting The knowledge of the data volume acquired over time can be relevant to the anticipation of needs in terms of information management and storage, in particular within the relevance to have 20% of disks storage capacity not used. In fact, and in average, every year has been produced more than 1.340 GB of metadata, and based on a retrospective analysis of information stored in the PACS archive, we expect that next year will be necessary to acquire 4 more disks for data storage. Within the quantity of information stored, in addition to the CT modality contribution, the MR modality emerges as the second modality with more images stored in the PACS archive. In this context, the existence of an increase in the number of images may be associated with an increased number of studies, which may represent an increase of financial burden for the institution whenever they are paid to health care facilities external to HC. On the other hand, MR studies may come from other health care facilities and does not represent a spending increase, it is, therefore, pertinent to identify these entities. In Radiology context, the production of a high data volume associated with imaging studies, and the constraints in accessing stored DICOM metadata supported by proprietary manufacturers tools for DICOM metadata analysis, emphasizes the need of new tools and methods for information analysis independently of manufacturers, stored information volume and information systems. The results of indexation and analysis of more than 20 million images, presented in this work, allows foreseeing the potential of the methodology used for the analysis of information stored in large PACS archives. The results of the work done and presented in this paper evidence the possibility of consolidation of a large volume of DICOM metadata, on the other hand, allows us to obtain relevant information to the provision of health care. In addition, allows us to identify usage trends of existing resources in different health care facilities, particularly in medical imaging equipment management context and DICOM information management, and makes it possible to audit the quality of the information stored in DICOM attributes. This aspect can be very important for the actors involved in the realization of the studies identification, but also in the identification and dissemination of good practices as well as for the definition of health care quality continuous improvement initiatives, particularly in the management of human and material resources scope. The flexibility that Dicoogle allows for conducting queries with different structures and according to user interests, and, by not using DICOM query & retrieve services for DICOM metadata access, leaves open the possibility of replication of the study presented in this paper in different professional realities, regardless different equipment manufacturers and information systems that exist in a clinical environment.. As future work, we foresee the possibility to carry out initiatives that enable the identification of situations that may represent opportunities for DICOM metadata quality improvement, as well as for the continuous improvement of health care provision at Radiology departments. This can be made through DICOM metadata indexing and analysis in a systematic way. References 1. Ondategui-Parra S, Bhagwat JG, Zou KH, Gogate A, Intriere LA, Kelly P, et al.

Tel.: +351 234 247 110. fax: +351 234401597. In a clinical environment are produced on daily basis huge volumes of information. In the radiology context, the realization of an increasing number of studies, in particular those associated with modalities that produce huge amounts of images, has given rise to large PACS archives. Proprietary tools available for the analysis of the stored information are limited and usually do not allow efficient analysis of the radiology department performance. In this work we demonstrate that with seamless access to DICOM metadata we can provide a consolidated view of departmental production data regardless of the heterogeneous imaging sources and subsidiary information systems. With our non-proprietary approach it is therefore feasible to conceive indicators that may be included in wider scope institutional performance evaluation. The results from the consolidated DICOM information analysis of more than 20 million images, belonging to more than 467 thousand studies performed on more than 162 thousand patients, justify the relevance of the implementation of similar methodologies in order to optimize the management of Radiology departments.

The use of a TV set at home as the central interaction and communication system is advantageous for elderly users that do not have a close relationship with technological advances but are used to control their TV set. The results of the evaluation of the AAL@MEO show that elderly users are willing for new services and have a milder rejection towards the interaction with the TV set.

All rights reserved.Background: Due to the challenges faced by health and social care systems, in particular those related to actual demographic trends, home care emerges as a potentially cost-effective solution to answer the needs of citizens, and to allow the reallocation of resources to alternatives to hospitalization or institutionalization. Objective: Home care services require cooperation between different actors, including health and social caregivers, care receivers, and their informal caregivers (eg, relatives or friends), across time, space, and organizational boundaries. Therefore, it is foreseeable that eHealth services can contribute to their improvement. The aim of this study is to evaluate information persistence services based on the Reference Information Model (RIM) of the Health Level Seven (HL7) version 3 to support formal caregivers, both health and social care providers, and informal caregivers in the context of home care services. Methods: A pilot study was set up involving two Portuguese institutions that provide home care services for the elderly. Defining of information requirements was performed according to a comprehensive process. This included a review of the literature, observations of work activities, interviews with caregivers, care receivers and their relatives, analysis of paper documentation related to care receivers' histories, health conditions and care plans, and brainstorming groups involving specialized professionals. Following this, information objects were implemented and validated. Results: The methodological approach, as well as the information persistence services, proved to be robust and adequate to specify, implement, and validate different types of information objects related to home care services for the elderly. This study also reinforces the application of the RIM of the HL7 version 3 beyond the strict scope of health care, allowing the persistence of not only health care information, but also information related to social assistance activities. Conclusions: This study contributes to the ongoing efforts related to the development of eHealth applications to improve the cooperation among formal health care and social caregivers, as well as care receivers and their informal caregivers.",

Fifty-five Portuguese older adults were assessed in two sessions, approximately one week apart. Test-retest reliability was evaluated by weighted kappa (K). Construct validity was evaluated by Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the RAPA and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) and the short physical performance battery (SPPB) (gait and chair stands tests, and total score); and by the Mann-Whitney U test between participants with and without depression and able and unable to complete the SPPB balance test.Results: Weighted K was 0.67 (95% CI=0.52–0.81) for reliability. A significant correlation was found between the RAPA and WHODAS 2.0 (rs=–0.47, p<0.01), gait test (rs=–0.45, p<0.01) and total SPPB score (rs=0.45, p<0.01). Participants able to complete the SPPB balance test had higher levels of physical activity than those unable (3.25±1.23 vs 2.37±1.30, p<0.05), and those without depression had higher levels of physical activity than those with depression (3.24±1.23 vs 2.50±1.34, p<0.05).Conclusions: The European Portuguese version of the RAPA questionnaire seems valid. However, its reliability requires further investigation.",

The study design was a two-sequence, two-period, randomized, crossover trial (NCT01967290) in 44 patients with upper-limb motor deficit (non-plegic) after medial cerebral artery ischemia. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the experimental session (repetitive motor task under vibratory feedback and 3D motor characterization) or the active comparator (3D motor characterization only). The primary outcome was the number of correct movements per minute on a hand-to-mouth task measured independently. Vibratory feedback was able to modulate motor training, increasing the number of correct movements by an average of 7.2/min (95%CI [4.9;9.4]; P < 0.001) and reducing the probability of performing an error from 1:3 to 1:9. This strategy may improve the efficacy of training on motor re-learning processes after stroke, and its clinical relevance deserves further study in longer duration trials.",

Innovative cognitive training methodologies and collaborative professional networks are necessary evolutions in the mental health sector. Objective: The objective of the study was to describe the implementation process and early outcomes of a nationwide multi-organizational network supported on a Web-based cognitive training system (COGWEB). Methods: The setting for network implementation was the Portuguese mental health system and the hospital-, academic-, community-based institutions and professionals providing cognitive training. The network started in August 2012, with 16 centers, and was monitored until September 2013 (inclusions were open). After onsite training, all were allowed to use COGWEB in their clinical or research activities. For supervision and maintenance were implemented newsletters, questionnaires, visits and webinars. The following outcomes were prospectively measured: (1) number, (2) type, (3) time to start, and (4) activity state of centers; age, gender, level of education, and medical diagnosis of patients enrolled. Results: The network included 68 professionals from 41 centers, (33/41) 80% clinical, (8/41) 19% nonclinical. A total of 298 patients received cognitive training; 45.3% (n=135) female, mean age 54.4 years (SD 18.7), mean educational level 9.8 years (SD 4.8). The number enrolled each month increased significantly (r=0.6; P=.031). At 12 months, 205 remained on treatment. The major causes of cognitive impairment were: (1) neurodegenerative (115/298, 38.6%), (2) structural brain lesions (63/298, 21.1%), (3) autoimmune (40/298, 13.4%), (4) schizophrenia (30/298, 10.1%), and (5) others (50/298, 16.8%). The comparison of the patient profiles, promoter versus all other clinical centers, showed significant increases in the diversity of causes and spectrums of ages and education. Conclusions: Over its first year, there was a major increase in the number of new centers and professionals, as well as of the clinical diversity of patients treated. The consolidation of such a national collaborative network represents an innovative step in mental health care evolution. Furthermore, it may contribute to translational processes in the field of cognitive training and reduce disease burden.",

All rights reserved.Background: Older adults' function level can be used as a predictor of future detrimental events, such as disability, reliance on others, risk of institutionalization and likelihood of death. The assessment of function at the primary health care centers using self-reported and/or performance based measures is of prime importance. Objective: To determine whether personal factors, pain, depression and physical activity are associated with self-reported and performance based disability for older adults aged ≥ 60 years attending primary health care centers, as measured by the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), respectively. Methods: Participants (196 females and 55 males; mean age ± SD = 70.87 ± 7.76) had their pain, self-reported disability, performance, physical activity levels and depressive symptoms assessed. Regression analyses were performed with self-reported and performance-based disability as the dependent variable and age, sex, education, chronic conditions, depression, physical activity and pain characteristics as dependent variables. Results: Mean (SD) results for SPPB were 8.45 (2.86) and 20.06 (8.21) for WHODAS. Pain intensity, depression, pain frequency, number of chronic conditions and level of physical activity explained 44% of the self-reported disability variance. Pain intensity, age, level of physical activity, years of formal education and chronic conditions explained 37% of the performance variance. Pain intensity alone explained 27% and 18% of the self-reported and performance based disability, respectively. Conclusion: Findings indicate that primary health care interventions should target pain intensity, depressive symptoms and physical activity as a means to preventing or decreasing both self-reported and performance based disability.",

Background Older adults' function level can be used as a predictor of future detrimental events, such as disability, reliance on others, risk of institutionalization and likelihood of death. The assessment of function at the primary health care centers using self-reported and/or performance based measures is of prime importance. Objective To determine whether personal factors, pain, depression and physical activity are associated with self-reported and performance based disability for older adults aged ≥60 years attending primary health care centers, as measured by the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), respectively. Methods Participants (196 females and 55 males; mean age ± SD = 70.87 ± 7.76) had their pain, self-reported disability, performance, physical activity levels and depressive symptoms assessed. Regression analyses were performed with self-reported and performance-based disability as the dependent variable and age, sex, education, chronic conditions, depression, physical activity and pain characteristics as dependent variables. Results Mean (SD) results for SPPB were 8.45 (2.86) and 20.06 (8.21) for WHODAS. Pain intensity, depression, pain frequency, number of chronic conditions and level of physical activity explained 44% of the self-reported disability variance. Pain intensity, age, level of physical activity, years of formal education and chronic conditions explained 37% of the performance variance. Pain intensity alone explained 27% and 18% of the self-reported and performance based disability, respectively. Conclusion Findings indicate that primary health care interventions should target pain intensity, depressive symptoms and physical activity as a means to preventing or decreasing both self-reported and performance based disability. Keywords Pain intensity Performance-based disability Self-reported disability Determinants Quantifying the functional consequences of disease is of prime importance when assessing older adults' health condition as a decrease in function has been shown to be a predictor of greater disability, more reliance on others, higher risk of institutionalization and an increased likelihood of death. 1–4 Functional assessment can be performed using self-reported measures and/or performance based measures. The first instruments capture the individuals' perception of their ability/inability to perform a range of activities in their day-to-day life. The latter instruments capture how well people can perform a task and usually involve the completion or timing of basic strength, balance, or mobility tasks. 5 Therefore, they seem to measure different but complementary constructs. In light of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), 6 self-reported disability instruments are related to the individual's participation while performance based disability instruments are more related to activities. Participation is defined as the person's involvement in a life situation, while activities refer to the execution of a task or action. 6 Previous studies have shown that several physiological and psychosocial factors, such as age, strength, physical activity, falls efficacy, aspects of pain or depressive symptoms are related to performance based and/or self-reported based disability for older adults with mobility limitation, 7 patients with musculoskeletal pain 8 and patients with low back pain. 9 However, it is unclear whether self-reported and performance based functional status are associated with different individual's characteristics, in particular pain characteristics, as different studies use different instruments. In addition, we were unable to find any study exploring the underlying predictors of performance based and self-reported disability for older adults at primary health care centers. This is of major relevance as it would inform which aspects need to be targeted by primary health care interventions in order to prevent further degradation of function. In this study we used the 12 item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) as a measure of self-reported disability and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) as a measure of performance-based disability. The WHODAS 2.0 is a generic, valid and reliable instrument that has a longer version with 36 items that takes up to 45 min to complete rendering it difficult to use in a clinical context and a shorter version of 12 items that explains up to 80% of the longer version variance and takes 10 min to complete rendering it easier to use in the primary health care context. 10 The SPPB is one of the most used performance based instruments both in research and clinical practice and is easy to administer without the use of specialized equipment. 3,11 Furthermore, it has been shown to be reliable and valid among several elderly populations that differ in terms of culture, language and education 5,12 and to be an important predictor of several adverse events such as disability, hospitalization and death. 13,14 Both SPPB and WHODAS 2.0 are simple and easy to use instruments that can be used in primary health care to characterize patients' functional status and screen for individuals at risk of developing greater disability. However, the association between these two instruments has not been investigated. The aim of this study is to determine whether personal factors, pain aspects, depression and physical activity are associated with self-reported and performance based disability for older adults attending primary health care centers as measured by the WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB, respectively. Methods Participants Participants were older adults comprising a convenience sample and were recruited through primary health care practices, either by referral from health care practitioners or direct invitation by researchers, among those attending health services on the days of data collection. Subjects could be enrolled in the study if they were ≥60 years old and were able to give written informed consent. This was ascertained by asking participants to explain on their own words what the study involved. The study received Ethical approval from the Regional Health Administration Commission, Coimbra, Portugal. All participants signed an informed consent prior to their participation. Procedures All participants were interviewed once by a researcher at the primary health care center that the participant usually attended. Demographic and health characteristics, aspects of pain, depressive symptoms and physical activity were assessed as these have previously been identified as predictors of disability. 7,8,15 The specific procedures and instruments used are specified below: Demographic and health characteristics Demographic and health characteristics included age, sex, years of formal education, occupation, marital status and presence of chronic disorders. The presence of the latest was ascertained by asking participants whether they had any of the following conditions: i) hypertension, ii) diabetes, iii) cardiovascular disorders, iv) respiratory disorders, v) cancer, vi) osteoarthritis (back, hip or knee), vii) other known medical condition or viii) any medical condition for which the nature/medical diagnosis was not known. The total number of reported chronic conditions was counted. The categorization of comorbidities based on number of comorbidities has been used in previous studies. 8,16 Self-reported disability Self-reported disability was assessed using the Portuguese version of the 12-item interview administered version of WHODAS 2.0, which is valid and reliable. 17 The WHODAS 2.0 is a disability assessment instrument based on the conceptual framework of the ICF with a recall period of 30 days and provides a global measure of disability. 10 WHODAS 2.0 scores were computed according to the simple scoring method as indicated in the manual. 10 This included summing the scores assigned to each of the 12 items – “none” (1), “mild” (2), moderate (3), severe (4) and extreme (5). The sum score for global disability therefore ranged from 0 (no disability) to 60 (complete disability), with higher scores indicating higher levels of disability. Missing data were also handled as suggested in the WHODAS 2.0 manual: when one item was missing a value, the mean of the other items was calculated and used to assign a score to the missing item. 10 Performance-based disability Performance-based disability was assessed using the SPPB. 2 SPPB total score is a composite score based on the individual scores of three timed tasks: the ability to stand with the feet side by side/semitandem/tandem for 10 s (balance), usual walking speed (calculated over 3 m), and the ability to rise from a chair as quickly as possible for five consecutive times. Each of the three performance measures was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the inability to complete the test and 4 indicating the highest level of performance. A summary score (range 0–12) was subsequently calculated by adding the scores of each individual test. Higher scores reflect higher levels of function. 2 Pain intensity, frequency, duration and number of pain sites Pain assessment in clinical practice is essential for older people and requires the use of instruments that are easy and simple to understand. 18 Published guidelines for pain assessment in older people recommend the use of a vertical numeric graphic rating scale and of a body chart for the assessment of pain intensity and location, respectively. 18 Therefore, we measured pain intensity today using a 10 cm vertical numeric graphic rating scale, with 0 for no pain and 10 for the most severe pain imaginable. Participants were also asked to mark on a body chart where they felt pain in the preceding week. The number of pain sites was then counted and categorized as 1) single pain site, 2) two pain sites, 3) 3 or more pain sites but not meeting the criteria for widespread pain and 4) widespread pain. Widespread pain was defined as pain in the left and right side of the body, pain above and below the waist and axial-skeletal pain. 19 Both the numeric rating scale and the body chart have been shown to be valid and reliable in older people. 20,21 In addition, pain frequency and duration were also assessed using two forced choice questions. Pain frequency during the week before the interview was assessed by asking participants to choose one of the following options: 1) seldom (once a week), 2) occasionally (2–3 times a week), 3) often (more than 3 times a week) or 4) always (all days). This was transformed into a two level variable for analysis: 1) pain seldom or occasionally and 2) pain often or always. To characterize pain duration participants were asked for how long they felt pain and answers were categorized as 1) <6 months and 2) ≥6 months. Depressive symptoms Depressive symptoms were assessed using the short version of the Portuguese translation of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), 22 a valid and reliable 15 item self-report scale of depression initially developed for adults aged 65 years or more. 23 However, a more recent study 24 showed that its level of sensitivity and specificity for patients aged less than 65 is comparable to that of patients aged more than 65 years. Therefore, GDS was adopted in this study. Participants are asked to respond by answering yes or no to each of the 15 items. Ten items indicate the presence of depression when answered positively and 5 indicate depression when answered negatively. For analysis, results were dichotomized as 1) no depressive symptoms (4 points or less) and 2) depressive symptoms (5 points or more). 24 Physical activity Physical activity was assessed using the Portuguese version of the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) questionnaire. 25,26 This questionnaire was specifically designed for use with older people and has 9 items (7 + 2) with response options of yes or no. The total score of the first seven items is from 1 to 7 points, with the respondent's score categorized into one of five levels of physical activity: 1) sedentary (item 1: I rarely or never do any physical activities), 2) underactive (item 2: I do some light or moderate physical activities, but not every week), 3) regular underactive, light activities (item 3: I do some light physical activity every week), 4) regular underactive (item 4: I do moderate physical activities every week, but less than 30 min a day or 5 days a week; and item 5: I do vigorous physical activities every week, but less than 20 min a day or 3 days a week), and 5) regular active (items 6: I do 30 min or more a day of moderate physical activities, 5 or more days a week; and item 7: I do 20 min or more a day of vigorous physical activities, 3 or more days a week). The last 2 items are about strength training and flexibility and are scored separately for individuals that reach the item 7 only as: 1) strength training, 2) flexibility or 3) both. 25 Statistical analysis The Predictive Analytics Software (PAWS software) (IBM, New York) (formerly SPSS Statistics) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample in terms of age, sex, years of formal education, occupation, marital status, chronic conditions, depression, WHODAS 2.0 scores, SPPB scores, RAPA scores, and pain characteristics. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported for continuous variables and count and proportion were reported for categorical variables. The relationship between age, years of formal education, number of pain sites, pain intensity, number of chronic conditions and physical activity and WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores was calculated using Spearman correlation coefficients. Differences in WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores for dichotomous variables (sex, presence or absence of depression, pain duration and pain frequency) were investigated using t-tests. Only the variables that showed a statistically significant correlation with WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores or a significant difference between groups were entered in the model. A correlation matrix for all independent variables was performed to assess multicollinearity and inform the regression model. Tolerance values >0.2 and Variation Inflation Factor >10 were required for variables to be included in the final model. 27 Stepwise regression analyses were performed with WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores as the dependent variable. The independent predictors of both WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores were analyzed using separate models. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Sample characteristics A total of 251 (196 females and 55 males) participants from 12 out of a total of 16 primary care practices located across the Council of Aveiro, Portugal, participated in the study. Participants' mean age was 70.87 ± 7.76 years (range 60–90). A detailed characterization is presented in Table 1 . Depression, pain and level of physical activity A total of 98 participants (42%) had a score ≥5 in the GDS indicating depressive symptoms. In what concerns pain, 203 (81%) of the 251 participants reported pain in at least one site during the week preceding data collection with a mean intensity of 5.58 ± 2.31 at the time of data collection. In general, most participants had multisite or widespread pain (133; 53%), that was chronic, i.e., pain duration was ≥6 months (170; 84%) and often or always present (148; 73%) (Table 1). Less than a quarter of participants were either regular underactive or regular active and only 6 participants reported to perform strength and/or flexibility training (Table 1). Disability The mean ± SD total WHODAS 2.0 score was 20.06 ± 8.21. Mean ± SD scores for the 12 individual items varied between a minimum of 1.13 ± 0.46 (item 10: Dealing with people you do not know) and a maximum of 2.34 ± 1.30 (item 1: Standing for long periods such as 30 min) indicating none to mild disability (Table 2 ). Item 12 was missing in 134 (53%) of participants as these participants reported not to be working or studying and was replaced by the mean of the other 11 items. However, mean scores of item 12 for these participants were not significantly different from mean values for the remaining participants (mean ± SD of item 12 when replaced by the mean values of the other 11 items = 1.73 ± 0.88; mean ± SD of item 12 as reported by participants = 1.79 ± 0.70, p = 0.55). The mean total SPPB score was 8.75 ± 2.86 out of a maximum score of 12. A total of 248 (99%) of participants performed the usual gait speed test with a mean ± SD time to walk 3 m of 4.94 ± 2.27 s. A total of 221 (89%) participants were able to perform the chair stand test and took (mean ± SD) 12.88 ± 4.52 s to perform it. Only 176 (75%) of participants were able to maintain tandem stance for 10 s (Table 3 ). Associations Correlations between the independent variables (age, years of formal education, pain intensity, and number of pain sites, physical activity level and number of chronic conditions) are presented in Table 4 . Significant correlations were found between WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB and all these variables. Significant differences for WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores were also found for all categorical variables (sex, GDS, pain frequency and pain duration) (Table 5 ). Tolerance and VIF values were above the cut off points for all variables. Therefore, the following variables were entered in the regression model for both WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB: i) age, ii) sex, iii) years of formal education, iv) number of chronic conditions, v) pain intensity, vi) number of pain sites, vii) pain duration, viii) pain frequency; ix) depressive/no depressive symptoms and x) physical activity level. A significant and high correlation was found between the WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores (r = 0.70; p < 0.01), suggesting that performance and self-reported disability are associated. Linear regression models Table 6 shows the results of the multiple linear stepwise regression analysis. Pain intensity, depressive symptoms, pain frequency, number of chronic conditions and level of physical activity remained in the final model for total WHODAS 2.0 score and explained 44% of its variance. Pain intensity, age, level of physical activity, years of formal education and chronic conditions remained in the final model for SPPB scores and explained 37% of its variance. Although pain intensity emerged as the most important predictor of both self-reported and performance based disability, it seems to be a stronger predictor of the latest. In addition, pain frequency and depressive symptoms were not present in the SPPB model, while level of physical activity explains more of the SPPB variance than of the WHODAS 2.0 variance, suggesting that self-reported and performance based disability have different but also similar predictors. For these, the magnitude of association with the WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB seem to vary. Discussion The results of this study suggest that some of the underlying predictors of the self-reported and performance based disability are common. However, there are also variables that seem to be associated with one form of disability only: depressive symptoms and pain frequency are associated with self-reported disability only and age and years of formal education are associated with performance based disability only. Pain intensity, level of physical activity and number of chronic conditions are associated with both self-reported and performance based disability, however the magnitude of this association varies. For example, pain intensity emerged as the most important predictor of both self-reported and performance based disability, but explains 18% of the SPPB variance and 27% of the WHODAS 2.0 variance. Similarly, level of physical activity seems to explain around 9% of the SPPB variance and only 1% of the WHODAS 2.0 variance. Another interesting finding of our study was the significant and high correlation found between the WHODAS 2.0 and SPPB scores (r = 0.70; p < 0.01), further supporting the idea of an association between self-reported and performance based disability as illustrated by the finding of common predictors. The similarities and differences found for self-reported and performance based predictors seem to corroborate the assumption that both instruments assess slightly different aspects of function. Overall, the models explain 27% of the SPPB and 44% of WHODAS 2.0. Similar results were found by Bean et al 7 who reported multivariable regression models predicting 33% and 42% of the variance of the SPPB and Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument, respectively. There are also similarities in some of the disability predictors identified in both studies. Bean et al 7 reported that leg strength, leg velocity, exercise tolerance and age, were associated with SPPB, while leg velocity, aerobic capacity, number of chronic conditions, sex, and falls efficacy were associated with self-reported disability. Pain was not assessed in this study. The finding that pain intensity is the most important predictor of both self-reported and performance based disability has an important practical implication, suggesting that primary health care interventions should target pain, in particular, pain intensity as a means to improve both self-reported and performance based disability. This is even more important as participants in this study were not necessarily looking for pain related-care. However, pain prevalence rates in this study (81%) are similar to those of an older adults population based study that reported the 4-week prevalence of any pain to be 72%. 28 It also corroborates previous findings of our team in a sample of participants with musculoskeletal pain aged ≥50 years old. 8 In this previous study pain intensity was the most important predictor of the 36-items WHODAS 2.0 total scores, explaining 19% of its variance. Additionally, it was also the most important predictor of the scores of 3 out of 6 subdomains, namely getting around, self-care and household activities and work. In addition, a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial that manipulated pain intensity by administering opioid analgesics to patients with chronic back pain, found that the acute administration of opioid analgesics improved lifting performance between 15% and 48%. Improvements in exercise performance were attributed to reduced pain intensity, implicating pain as an important influence on performance. 29 Depressive symptoms also emerged as an important modifiable predictor of self-reported disability, but not of performance-based disability. This is in agreement with a previous study of our team 8 where depression emerged as the second most important predictor of self-reported disability. However, they contrast with the findings of Penninx et al 30 who found that chronic depression has a large impact on physical decline over time among community-dwelling older persons, but not remittent depression. In our study depression was assessed at only one time point preventing distinction between chronic and remittent depression and this might explain the contrasting results. The inclusion of physical activity level in both models of disability and the low levels of physical activity reported by participants in our study (only 11.2% were classified as regular active) highlight the need of strategies to improve physical activity levels as a means of preventing disability. A systematic review on the relationship between functional independence and physical activity recommends physical activity above baseline “normal” daily activity levels at an intensity of moderate to moderately vigorous aerobic (endurance) activity, with a total weekly volume of 150–180 min/wk. This physical activity would translate to a >30% decrease in the relative risk of morbidity and mortality, and loss of independence, and further benefit would accrue with greater physical activity and greater fitness gains. 31 Mean SPPB scores (8.75 ± 2.86) and mean WHODAS 2.0 scores (20.06 ± 8.21) found in this study are similar to those previously reported in the literature for older adults aged 65 years or more. 7,32,33 Bean et al 7 assessed 137 older adults with limited mobility and reported mean (±SD) SPPB scores of 8.70 ± 1.50. Gomes et al 32 assessed 313 older adults who lived in the community and presented SPPB results separately for those participants with depressive symptoms (mean ± SD = 7.42 ± 2.90) and without depressive symptoms (mean ± SD = 8.92 ± 2.40). Sousa et al 33 assessed older people living in seven low- and middle-income countries (urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Mexico, Peru, China and India). The sample size for each country was between 2000 and 3000 participants and mean WHODAS 2.0 scores varied between 15.7 ± 15.4 and 33.2 ± 28.9. Study limitations The results of this study need to be seen in light of its limitations. The cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow inferences on causal relationships between predictors and disability measures. In addition, pain intensity, self-reported disability and performance-based disability refer to different periods of assessment as participants were asked to report on pain intensity for the actual moment and self-reported disability for the previous 30 days. It is unknown whether these different periods of recall for the main variables of interest as well as recall bias (for WHODAS 2.0) might have affected the results. Additionally, the SPPB includes tests for lower limb function only while WHODAS 2.0 assesses domains that require intact functioning of the upper limbs as well. For example taking care of household responsibilities or getting dressed is, usually, dependent of upper limb function. This might have decreased the potential of similarity between both measures of disability. Another limitation is related with the count of comorbidities based on participants' self-report as participants might not have accurate knowledge on comorbidities and total count fails to incorporate disease severity. Future studies may explore the use of pain and physical activity diaries and include a performance based instrument for the upper limb. Furthermore, prospective studies on the long term predictors of self-reported and performance-based disability for older adults are needed. Conclusions Our results show similarities and differences in the underlying predictors of self-reported and performance based disability suggesting that they relate to complementary aspects of function. In addition, they have practical implications for the planning of primary health care interventions, indicating the need for targeting pain intensity, depressive symptoms and physical activity as a means to preventing or decreasing both self-reported and performance based disability.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Eric and CiteSeerX databases using a predefined strategy. The relevant literature extracted was screened and a list of models and frameworks was elaborated. Seven models or frameworks were included for analyses. It was possible to find ICF components in all of the models or frameworks.

        "doc_abstract": "Background: Cognitive training has been playing an increasing role in the treatment of patients with cognitive deficits. This type of intervention, namely its intensity, can be optimized by incorporating information technology-based systems. Objective: The intent of the study was to determine the treatment intensity and patient adherence to home-based cognitive training strategies (Web-based cognitive training). Methods: A cohort of 45 patients with neurologic and psychiatric diseases attending an outpatient memory clinic (average age 50.7 years, SD 17.0; average education 7.8 years, SD 4.9) was followed over 18 months. Participants were challenged to use a Web-based cognitive training system, \"COGWEB\", on a daily basis, and fulfilled at least four weeks of training supervised remotely. Additionally, 11 patients attended face-to-face sessions. Results: The average duration of continuous cognitive training was 18.8 weeks (SD 18.9). Each patient performed on average 363.5 minutes/week (SD 136.6). At 6-month follow-up, 82.8% complied with their treatment plan. The average proportion of complete weeks was 0.75 (SD 0.22). Patients with dementia trained more intensively (444.6 minutes/week), followed by patients with static brain lesion (414.5 minutes/week; P=.01). The group that held face-to-face sessions performed more training overall (481.4 vs 366.9 minutes/week), achieving a stronger expression and statistical significance in the last week of training (652.6 versus 354.9 minutes/week, P=.027). Conclusions: Overall, the weekly training intensity was high. Patients with dementia and static lesions performed more cognitive training. Face-to-face sessions were associated with higher intensities. The combination of classical methods with information technology systems seems to ensure greater training intensity.",

Selection and peer-review under responsibility of the Scientific Programme Committee of the 5th International Conference on Software Development and Technologies for Enhancing Accessibility and Fighting Info-exclusion (DSAI 2013). 410 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 Engineering of Porto and two small and medium enterprises, Micro I/O and Plux Wireless Biosignals, implemented a Living Usability Lab (LUL) located on the University of Aveiro campus (Aveiro, Portugal) [1, 2]. Although traditional approaches for the systems and services development usually consider the involvement of all stakeholders, including end users, it is nevertheless also true that the experts are the responsible for the conception, design and development of the systems and services, deciding which functions to integrate and how users interact with them. Users are only involved at an advanced stage, when the concepts are already consolidated, which means, in general, that the initial conceptualization is not based on their experiences or mental models. In contrast, a central aspect of a living lab methodology [2, 3] is the continuing involvement of the different stakeholders at all stages of the development process: idealization of concepts, requirements analysis, systems and services development and respective validation and assessment in semi-realists and structured contexts. The LUL aims to improve translational research and to promote the development, integration, validation and evaluation of new user interaction technologies related with Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems and services. These objectives are of most importance, given that ALL systems and services must have a broad range of intelligent functions in terms of user interaction, supported by usable and accessible interfaces with adaptive mechanisms [4], which is not always taken into due account. A recent systematic literature review [5] shows that only a low percentage of papers related with AAL refer the involvement of end-users, namely elderly and disabled people both in the development phases and in the results validation and evaluation. Therefore, it is clear that the usability and accessibility issues are not sufficiently explored within the AAL domain. Furthermore, knowing that AAL systems and services have complex interaction mechanisms, including explicit and implicit interactions, and that multimodality is a fundamental aspect [6], it becomes evident the need for additional concerns in terms of usability and accessibility. To solve the usability and accessibility issues, a close involvement of the end users is recommended. However, these could be less successful when the user population is varied and the involvement of elderly and disabled people introduces additional difficulties [7, 8]. Moreover, methods to obtain requirements and evaluation data from elderly and disabled people are not straightforward and monitoring or interacting with them in their home environments, rather than in a workplace situation, require additional organisational challenges [9, 10]. In these aspects, infrastructures like LUL could have an important role, if there is a methodological framework for the specification, development, validation and evaluation of new systems and services. This paper is not intended to be a comprehensive description of the LUL and the related technological services, nor the presentation of its wide range of methodological tools, but rather the explanation of how the concepts of personas and scenarios can be enhanced to ensure that the different stakeholders involved in the development of a given AAL system or service have a common view of the target users in all the development stages, which, consequently, may contribute to better solutions in terms of usability and accessibility. Considering that the AAL paradigm focuses on services that aim to maintain the human functioning and minimize the consequences of health conditions, within the methodological development of the LUL it was a major concern the use of systematic mechanisms to characterize the issues related to functioning, health conditions and quality of life. Thanks to an interdisciplinary collaboration in which the authors are involved [11, 12], it was possible to use the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) conceptual model [13] developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to optimize the essential role of personas and scenarios. This approach has the advantage of emphasizing the functioning in the development of new AAL systems and services, as well as the contextual factors that impact on those systems and services. It has been used, and consequently improved, in various projects related with AAL, namely AAL4ALL and Smartphones for Seniors. In addition to this introductory section the paper is composed of another four sections: Living Usability Lab, Conceptual Model for the Definition of Personas and Scenarios, Example of a Persona and Respective Scenario, and Conclusions. 411 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 2. Living Usability Lab The LUL is a collaborative, multi-contextual and empirical environment to allow [1, 2]: i) the development, integration and evaluation of systems and services with demanding interactive requirements, such as AAL solutions; ii) the development of comprehensive methodologies to support the different design and development phases of systems and services, from the initial conception to the final evaluation, involving users and other stakeholders; iii) the translational research related to interaction mechanisms and their adequacy to the users, the nature of the tasks, the surrounding contexts and the technological platforms and iv) the conception of reference models to consolidate knowledge related to the users' needs and critical mechanisms associated with the quality of services, interaction paradigms and development platforms. Living lab methodologies follow a perspective that conceives the users and the society as sources of innovation [14]. Therefore, within LUL, the stakeholders (including potential end users, formal and informal care providers, governmental and local organizations, research and development entities, funding agencies or industrial partners) must actively participate in the iterative process of specification, development, validation and evaluation that has three reference phases: the first one is the conceptual validation which is followed by the prototype test and, finally, the pilot test. The main objective of the conceptual validation is to verify the sustainability of the initial concepts for potential systems or services and if they deserve to be explored. Additionally, the conceptual validation should gather all the required information to allow the development of consolidated prototypes. In turn, the main purpose of the prototype test phase is to evaluate the systems and services in terms of usability and accessibility. The prototype test is conducted in a controlled environment involving real users and the results should be incorporated in the development to allow the implementation of systems and services to be evaluated during the pilot test. Finally, the third methodological phase, the pilot test, aims to assess not only usability and accessibility, but also the degree of user satisfaction and determine how the systems and services impact on the usersâ€™ daily lives. These different phases are not isolated from each other, but complementary. Moreover, the process, although sequential must be sufficiently flexible to allow advance and retreat along the different phases, since the assessment performed at each phase dictates the next steps in the course of the development of the systems and services. The methodology relies thus on a spiral development, in which it is possible to advance and retreat through the different methodological phases (Figure 1). Figure 1. Reference phases of the LUL methodology. Within the LUL, end users may be [1] i) elderly interested in maintaining their typical activities and everyday life tasks, including social participation; ii) elderly with activity limitations and participation restrictions due to specific 412 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 health conditions and iii) other informal caregivers that to provide care to people with special needs. It is also a LUL goal the involvement of formal carers (health care or social care providers) potentially interested in innovative systems and services to supervise and assist remotely their clients. Other service providers to consider are i) professionals of occupational or day centres able to offer, not necessarily for free, leisure activities and ii) other professionals that intend to develop specialized business solutions targeted to elderly. To complete a categorization which includes all the necessary contributions of the different stakeholders for the LUL success, four additional categories must be considered: i) researchers (either because their research can boost innovative projects, or because they can benefit from the LUL synergies, namely the ability to engage a large number of users and the proximity to social and business organizations); ii) students (whether in the engineering area, health or social sciences areas); iii) industrial partners interested in innovative solutions and to take advantage of the LUL added value and iv) policy makers who may help to create and maintain a supporting network for the LULâ€™s innovative environment. Given the potential users range, whether end users or services providers, efficient tools are needed to characterize and to ensure that this characterization is taken into account throughout the development process. In particular, the experience of research and development fostered by LUL has shown that the elaboration of personas is an essential tool so that the involved parties always consider, in a clear and throughout manner, the design phases (development, validation and assessment), the essential characteristics and needs of the potential end users, which obviously have a significant impact in terms of usability and accessibility of the interaction mechanisms. 3. Conceptual Model for the Definition of Personas and Scenarios Personas are potential usersâ€™ group representations with characteristics, needs, behaviours, motivations and common expectations. According to Cooper [15], despite being fictitious, personas must be precisely and accurately defined from detailed knowledge about the target population. The details are important to promote that all stakeholders share a consistent view of potential end users, allowing one â€œhuman face\" for a set of demographic data. Therefore, it is necessary to consider various aspects: Î¾ The characteristics of the potential users of the systems and services being developed and what roles they can play. Î¾ The potential usersâ€™ needs and behaviours, and how these may vary over time. Î¾ The potential usersâ€™ motivations and expectations in respect of the systems and services being developed. In systems development methodologies, scenarios often appear associated with personas. Typically, a scenario describes how a given system or service can be used, in a given context and in a given period of time. It is usually developed by usability experts, in a close collaboration with users and developers. The scenarios are written in a simple language, with minimal technical details, in order to provide to concerned parties a common example to focus their discussions, and should provide: Î¾ The surrounding contexts that need to be explored. Î¾ The situations or events that have impact on personas. Î¾ The information requirements that the system needs to incorporate. Î¾ The functions or actions requirements that the system must be able to perform. Î¾ The technological requirements that may be significant for the system performance. Î¾ The interaction requirements, i.e. what kind of precaution should be considered in the management of the interaction mechanisms that may vary accordingly to the scenarios being considered. Î¾ Other requirements, such as business or corporate requirements. Given the various methods available, there are many alternatives that can be considered as a starting point for the elaboration of personas and scenarios: interviews, questionnaires, observational studies, focus groups, brainstorms, nominal groups, creation workshops and day-books fulfilments. The information gathered through these methods allows systematizing the different personasâ€™ characteristics and elaborating the different scenariosâ€™ requirements. 413 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 Considering that potential end users of AAL systems and services are elderly, health conditions are important factors. Furthermore, AAL aims to increase the autonomy of older people and assist their daily living activities, improving, therefore, their functioning. This implies that end usersâ€™ health conditions and functioning must be highlighted. The ICF conceptualizes functioning associated to health conditions in an extended socio-ecological context which also considers the role of services, systems and technologies. The ICF considers the structures and body functions, activities, participation and contextual factors [13] as components of the personâ€™s functioning: Î¾ The body's functions entail the individualâ€™s physiological functions. The ICF defines impairment as any problem of the individual with his/her body functions. Physical functions depreciations can, in principle, have no consequences for the individual's ability to do activities, especially if there is a help aid that compensates a particular function depreciation (e.g. an individual with weak eyesight wearing glasses would not have a limitation; an individual with a missing leg with a prosthesis will be able to do activities). Î¾ Activities are the individualâ€™s recital of assignments and tasks. Difficulties with these activities are noted as activity limitations. Limitations are usually due to function depreciation of body functions but also due to environmental hindrances. When the individual's ability to do activities is evaluated the consequences of function depreciation or environmental barriers become clear. Î¾ Participation covers the individualâ€™s involvement in daily life and society. Difficulties in participation are classified as participation restrictions. The same way as activities limitations, the participation restrictions can be caused by weakness, illness and/or handicap but also due to environmental hindrances. There is also a restriction when the individual is not being able to do activities according to his/her own norms of what is considered acceptable. Î¾ The contextual factors are the environmental and personal factors which either enhance or limit the individual's functioning. The environmental factors are the physical, social or attitudinal world ranging from the immediate to more general environment. The personal factors entail elements that make people different and unique, such as life style, education level, gender, etnicity, life events or psychological characteristics. These factors are important to explain certain situations (e.g. two individuals with the same diagnosis or physical function depreciation may have different limitations when it comes to activities and participation). The environmental factors can have a positive (i.e. be facilitators) or negative impact (i.e. be barriers) on the individualâ€™s performance as a member of society, on the individualâ€™s capacity to execute actions or tasks, or on the individualâ€™s body function or structure. When coding an environmental factor as a facilitator, issues such as the accessibility of the resource, and whether access is dependable or variable, of good or poor quality, should be considered. In the case of barriers, it might be relevant to take into account how often a factor hinders the person, whether the hindrance is great or small, or avoidable or not. It should also be kept in mind that an environmental factor can be a barrier either because of its presence (e.g. negative attitudes towards people) or its absence (e.g. the unavailability of a needed service). The authors propose to use the ICF fundamental concepts related to functioning and performance in activities and participation for the specification, development and evaluation of AAL systems and services. In particular, the ICF concepts may be used for building personas, in order to consider and structure aspects such as: Î¾ The bodyâ€™s structures and functions. Î¾ The relevant aspects of health conditions that may constrain the systems or services use (health conditions should not be understood only as a disease, but also as specific features which are present in the persona, and that will restrain the systems or services use). Additionally, the ICF can also help to systematize particular aspects of personas, including: Î¾ Activities and participation (which has consequences on the daily routines). Î¾ Environmental factors (e.g. a noisy environment turns difficult to use the telephone). Furthermore, the ICF allows alternative forms over what is normally considered in personasâ€™ defining aspects, such as personal factors (e.g. the specific life history and individual lifestyle), which the ICF considers alongside 414 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 with environmental factors, or the contextual factors. In this respect, the ICF considers that the individualâ€™s functioning results of his/her own health conditions interacting with his/her contextual factors [16]. This dynamic interaction is important for scenariosâ€™ definition. A narrative of events or persona experienced situations (a persona can remain unchanged, but the scenario demands changes in the use of systems and services) can be enriched by the identification, in a given situation, of the events and the positive or negative factors (facilitators or barriers, according to the ICF) that impact on activity and participation of personas. In the following section it is explained how the ICF was used for personas and scenarios development within the LUL framework. 4. Example of a Persona and Respective Scenario As already mentioned, the conceptualisation of a persona must consider the potential end users of the systems and services being developed, based on existing or specifically collected data, namely demographic data. However, there should be always present the need for personalization, as can be seen in the persona Anselmo Pires represented in Table 1. Table 1. Persona Anselmo Pires. Example of a Persona: Anselmo Pires Persona: Principal. Name: Anselmo Pires. Age: 67 years old. Location: Matosinhos. Technological Proficiency: Basic computer skills. Position: Senior partner and manager of a carrier business. Personal History: Anselmo Pires is married to Marieta Pires and has two sons, Alberto and Romeu, and a 23 years old grandson, CÃ©sar. Recently, he had a heart attack that made him weaker. Anselmo started cycling with his son Alberto at the weekends. Since he is the senior partner and manager he has the habit to get up early in order to be the first to reach the office. Normally, he goes out of home without taking breakfast, which compensates with a mid-morning break in the patisserie near the office. Anselmo stays at the office up to 8PM and has dinner at home around 8:30PM with Marieta. Once a week, he plays chess with his grandson, a habit started in the first scholar holidays of his grandson. Motivation: His grandson is now in London to continue his studies and Anselmo wants to keep contact and proximity with him, since they have always been very close. Frustrations: Whenever he tries to talk to his grandson using a video call, Anselmo eventually gets bored with the process. Although he has some basic computer skills, making a video call is something that frustrates him, because of the associated complexity. Quote: \"I play chess with my grandson every week, there are already 16 years!\" The persona Anselmo Pires was developed according to the principles proposed by Cooper [15]. Analysing the persona description, we can easily see that the personal history consists of a set of personal characteristics and description of some aspects of daily routines. In particular, some information appears described in various ways. This is the case of computer literacy that is referred in the topic technological proficiency and also in the topic frustrations (\"Although he has some basic computer skills... \"). On the other hand, the points related to health conditions are focused on an existing pathology. Finally, it is possible to state a negative point of view, as stated in the discrimination of possible frustrations. 415 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 In contrast, in the model proposed by the authors, there is a concern to identify different groups of information: Î¾ Personal factors: individualâ€™s life history and characteristics. For example, he/she likes blue, he/she prefers voice interaction or he/she is funny. Î¾ Health conditions: generic term for diseases (acute or chronic), injuries or traumas. It may also include other circumstances like pregnancy, age, stress, congenital abnormality or predisposition. For example, an individual has limitations in mobility of the right upper limb and he/she suffers of lowback pain. Î¾ Daily routines: individualâ€™s planning and management of demands, tasks and obligations of everyday life. Î¾ Activity types: individualâ€™s execution of tasks or actions. For example, buy a book, write a letter, do a mental exercise or clean the floor. Î¾ Participation: individualâ€™s involvement in life situations. For example, social events, educational activities or household management. Therefore, instead of the heterogeneous topic personal history, the authors propose a clear distinction between personal factors and daily routines, because this information is considered essential in the context of AAL systems and services. On the other hand, the authors strongly suggest the neutral perspective associated to the ICF (it should only be identified those facts that determine functioning or performance), which implies some concerns with the description. For instance, instead of referring to \"Since he is the senior partner and manager he has the habit to get up early in order to be the first to reach the officeâ€� we should refer â€œhe is the senior partner and manager and he has the habit to get up early\", i.e. only neutral information. In this perspective, there should not also be references to frustrations, but only abilities and personal factors such as personal tastes. In terms of health conditions, these should not appear associated with a deficiency in the structure or function of the body or to an existing pathology, but rather with a holistic perspective. Often a limitation in activities or a restriction in participation occur due to health conditions, but they are also influenced by the context in which the activities or participation will be held. The definition of a persona using the ICF concepts should clarify what health conditions and context situations may interfere with the performance of the individual along with the description of daily routines and types of participation. Incidentally the concept participation appears as something innovative in the elaboration of personas, because it is something more complex than activity that contains information related to a life event. The modified version of the persona Anselmo Pires (Table 2), which has been used in the project Smartphones for Seniors[17], includes personal factors that may influence the way the user interacts with the systems and services: Anselmo has 67 years old, lives with his wife, has the fourth grade and basic computer skills and is the senior partner and manager of a carrier business. According to this information the interaction may have to be simplified due to his lower academic or computer literacy. The daily routines are also important elements in defining the personas as they will constrain the use of the available systems and services. In the current example, Anselmo has the habit of getting up early, not taking breakfast at home because he prefers to take a mid-morning break in the patisserie near his office and he works up to 8PM. The fact of taking breakfast in the patisserie can interfere with a smart phone interaction and the fact of working up to 8PM means, in principle, that he will only access leisure features after that time. The health conditions are associated to relevant information that will impact on the performance of some activities and participation. For example, Anselmo had an episode of hospital admission and was recommended to start performing physical exercises and to manage his health condition via regular monitoring of blood pressure. Activity and participation turn out to be implicit in health conditions. For example, the regular monitoring of blood pressure has impact in daily routines. It is also possible identify specific activities that are also driven by his health conditions (e.g. cycling with his eldest son). The case of participation is similar to activities since they may result from variations in health conditions and daily routines, or be identified as specific interests (e.g. Anselmo wants to keep a close contact with his grandson who is now in London). 416 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 Table 2. Modified version of the Persona Anselmo Pires. Example of a Persona: Anselmo Pires Name: Anselmo Pires [Personal factor]. Age: 67 years old [Personal factor]. Anselmo Pires lives in Matosinhos, with his wife Marieta Pires. Their marriage has 30 years and they still have the same complicity of the first years [Personal factor]. He has elementary education and basic computer skills. He is the senior partner and manager of a carrier business [Personal factor]. Recently Anselmo had to be hospitalized due to a suspect of a heart attack. He was recommended to do daily exercises and to monitor his blood pressure [Health condition]. Anselmo usually wakes up early. He doesnâ€™t take breakfast at home, he prefers to take it in the middle of the morning in a patisserie near his office. He stays at the office up to 8PM. Around 8:30PM, he has dinner with his wife at home [Daily routine]. At the weekend Anselmo goes cycling with his eldest son [Activity type]. He has a 23 years old grandson, CÃ©sar, and they play chess once a week. [Participation type], a habit started in the first scholar holidays of his grandson. Anselmo wants to keep a close contact with his grandson who is now in London. They have a strong relationship. In many occasions his grandson asks his opinion about what to do, whether is related with his personal life or work [Participation type]. The definition of scenarios should also consider all the existing information on the target usersâ€™ needs, in order to specify the functional requirements of the systems and services to be developed: Î¾ Problems scenarios: identification of the actual situations, events (positive or negative) that have impact in personasâ€™ activities. For example, the voice interaction is a barrier in a noisy environment or the keyboard should be big enough to facilitate the writing of a SMS. Î¾ Data requirements: information elements that the systems have to include. For example, in an email application the basic elements can be messages or contact lists. Î¾ Functional requirements: actions that the system has to complete, information that the system has to present as well technological requirements relevant to the way the system should perform (e.g. requirements in terms of video calls, the types of interfaces required or the need of a Wi-Fi network). Î¾ Interaction requirements: detailed information about how user interaction should be, which can vary according to the created scenarios, even if thereâ€™s no alteration in userâ€™s characteristics. For example, Anselmo likes to use keyboard, but when heâ€™s driving he uses voice interaction (the persona is the same, but the context has changed). Î¾ Other requirements: business, corporative or customer requirement. For example, prices, installation conditions, company characteristics that should be reflected in the systems and services. Identifying the problem is an important issue because it situates the activity to be achieved. For example, Anselmo likes to receive oral information related with his trucks in order to perform, simultaneously, two activities: getting information about the trucks situation while reading the documents left by his secretary in the previous day. In this example, associated with the identification of the problem, there are some data requirements (e.g. information on trucks) and interaction requirements (e.g. he likes to receive orally the information related with the trucks situation). Another problem identified was the need to monitor his blood pressure. Therefore, he needs an easy to use application that should not interfere with his activities. Table 3 presents how the authorâ€™s proposal was applied in the Smartphones for Seniors [17]. 417 Alexandra Queir s et al. / Procedia Computer Science 27 ( 2014 ) 409 418 Table 3. An illustrative application example of scenarios. Example of a Scenario for the Persona Anselmo Pires Anselmo starts his work at 8AM and the first task he does is to check the localization of the transports for that day [Problem scenario] and he wants this information early in the morning [Functional requirement]. Because he is an active person, he likes to receive this information orally [Interaction requirement] while he reads the documents left by his secretary in the previous day. Today Anselmo is upset because two trucks are immobilized in Switzerland due to an adverse whether situation. He is following the weather report with particular interest [Data requirement] and he has activated the feature of sound alert [Functional requirement] to know when the trucks start to travel. When the night comes, he still doesnâ€™t have any information. Anselmo has a family dinner to celebrate his 30 years of marriage, so he deactivates the sound alert and activates the vibrating alert [Interaction requirement]. Once a week Anselmo plays chess online [Problem scenario] with his grandson for keeping the regular contact and healthy competition, so he wants to have a shortcut in his personal computer to this application [Functional requirement]. Anselmo has several friends in Brazil [Problem scenario] and he uses Facebook to communicate with them, as it allows communication asynchronously, which is important due to the time difference [Functional requirement]. He uses his desktop personal computer, which he has to boot up every time, as it is usually off. By selecting a desktop shortcut he opens the browser to activate the Facebook He prefers an automatic access to Facebook, because he does not want to be bothered to log in every time he uses it and, furthermore, he often forgets the password [Functional requirement]). The first thing he does is to check his wall for new posts, scrolling up and down with the mouse to see if something grabs his eye. If so, he often replies using the keyboard [Interaction requirement], especially direct inquiries. He keeps a regular contact through the Facebook, sharing photographs (he would like to have a way to convert automatically the pictures size [Functional requirement]) and information about his daily routines [Data requirement]. Sometimes he also uses the video call [Functional requirement]. He thinks that the size of a smart phone is a problem because it is too small [Interaction requirement]. Anselmo has to monitor his blood pressure everyday [Problem scenario] and he decided to install an application to help him in this task. He is looking for an easy to use application. He is also looking for an application that can give him the latest information about his disease [Functional requirement]. 5. Conclusion The described methodology is being used to develop applications on several projects, including telerehabilitation applications [18], multimodal applications [19] smart phones applications [17] and applications for a Living Home system Center (LHC) [20]. The developed tools proved suitable for their purposes and are expected to be explored in future developments. One of the problems of the development of AAL systems and services is the difficulty of communication between users, care providers and technological professionals. Stakeholders with different backgrounds need a common language in order to make teamwork more efficient and effective. The ICF conceptual framework can contribute to this goal. However, there is still a long way to go so that everybody involved in AAL developments be able to share a common language and a set of common concepts.

The acceptance of the AAL paradigm is closely related to the quality of the available systems and services, namely in terms of the user interaction. This means that usability and accessibility are crucial issues. The paper presents how the concepts of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) can be used to optimize the role of personas and scenarios in the development and evaluation of AAL systems and services, especially in aspects related with human functioning and health conditions.

        "doc_abstract": "The Radiology departments are increasingly taking advantage of Information Technologies (IT) to enhance the efficiency and quality of patient care services. These IT systems are normally able to handle huge amounts of digital data and to extract relevant fingerprints useful to improve the quality of clinical practice. However, they provide multiple and heterogeneous databases and informational environments, namely regarding to the information stored in Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). The heterogeneous of environments make the access to the information a challenge to extract relevant data. This paper presents the deployment and validation process of the Dicoogle system in two health care facilities. This system represents a new approach able to collect and index information from distinct PACS archives, developed on top of Dicoogle, which allow the construction of multiple views over data repositories according to the standard Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM), in a flexible and fast way. The developed methodology can contribute to improve the use of DICOM metadata, stored over disperse PACS of radiology departments, which otherwise not be used in productivity, efficiency and quality initiatives at radiology departments. © 2013 AISTI.",

        "doc_abstract": "Background: Most studies that investigate the impact of pain on function have focused on a particular pain site and use unidimensional measures of disability, making it difficult to know how pain impacts on different areas of functioning and whether different pain characteristics impact differently on function. Aim: To investigate the relationship between pain characteristics and self-reported disability in patients with musculoskeletal pain aged ≥50 years. Methods: Two hundred and four consecutive patients with musculoskeletal pain aged ≥50 years had their pain assessed (frequency, global pain intensity, pain intensity for the most painful site, location and number of pain sites) and were asked to fill in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) that assesses disability in 6 domains of daily life. Results: Most patients reported chronic (77.5%), multisite or widespread (55.4%) pain that was always present (90.2%) and of moderate to severe intensity (mean score for global pain intensity = 5.91; SD = 2.02). Mean WHODAS 2.0 total score was 28.06 and SD was 19.86, corresponding to moderate disability. When entering age, sex, level of education, depression, number of comorbid chronic conditions and pain characteristics in a stepwise regression analysis, global pain intensity was the most important predictor for the domains of getting around (adjusted R2 = 0.21, p < 0.001), self-care (adjusted R 2 = 0.14, p < 0.001), household activities (adjusted R2 = 0.20, p < 0.001) and work (adjusted R2 = 0.34, p < 0.001) and total score (adjusted R2 = 0.19, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Pain intensity seems to be an important predictor of disability for several domains of life, suggesting that pain-related disability should be assessed for these domains. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Background Most studies that investigate the impact of pain on function have focused on a particular pain site and use unidimensional measures of disability, making it difficult to know how pain impacts on different areas of functioning and whether different pain characteristics impact differently on function. Aim To investigate the relationship between pain characteristics and self-reported disability in patients with musculoskeletal pain aged ≥50 years. Methods Two hundred and four consecutive patients with musculoskeletal pain aged ≥50 years had their pain assessed (frequency, global pain intensity, pain intensity for the most painful site, location and number of pain sites) and were asked to fill in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) that assesses disability in 6 domains of daily life. Results Most patients reported chronic (77.5%), multisite or widespread (55.4%) pain that was always present (90.2%) and of moderate to severe intensity (mean score for global pain intensity = 5.91; SD = 2.02). Mean WHODAS 2.0 total score was 28.06 and SD was 19.86, corresponding to moderate disability. When entering age, sex, level of education, depression, number of comorbid chronic conditions and pain characteristics in a stepwise regression analysis, global pain intensity was the most important predictor for the domains of getting around (adjusted R 2 = 0.21, p < 0.001), self-care (adjusted R 2 = 0.14, p < 0.001), household activities (adjusted R 2 = 0.20, p < 0.001) and work (adjusted R 2 = 0.34, p < 0.001) and total score (adjusted R 2 = 0.19, p < 0.001). Conclusions Pain intensity seems to be an important predictor of disability for several domains of life, suggesting that pain-related disability should be assessed for these domains. Keywords Musculoskeletal pain Disability WHODAS 2.0 Musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent in the general population internationally across all age groups. 1 The most common sites of musculoskeletal pain include the low back, shoulder and neck, affecting more than 20% of the world population and contributing to the high consumption of health care services. 1,2 Musculoskeletal pain is also associated with disability, leading to changes in the normal performance of a range of activities including moving around, recreational activities, sleep, work and psychological functioning. 3–6 Despite a slight decrease in the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain with age, 7 the extent to which it interferes with daily life has been shown to have a more than twofold increase for individuals 80 years old and older (35.0%) in relation to individuals 50–59 years old (16.0%). 8 Studies exploring the association between aspects of pain such as frequency, duration, intensity or number of pain sites on older adults revealed that they might impact differently on function. In a population-based study, Eggermont et al 9 found that number of musculoskeletal pain sites and pain severity were associated with poorer performance in a battery of physical performance tests. However, multisite pain was more strongly associated with lower function than pain severity. Hartvigsen et al 3 reported that duration and intensity of back and neck pain were associated with a decrease in physical activities, but duration appeared to be more important than intensity. However, most studies that investigate the association between pain aspects and function have focused only on one or two aspects of pain for a particular pain site such as the knee, the neck or the back, 3,9,10 making it difficult to compare how the different aspects of pain impact on function. In addition, most studies assess function through the use of physical performance tests including gait velocity, balance, and strength or chair stands. 9,11–14 However, pain may interfere with many life situations and it is difficult to know how a change in balance or chair stands translates into changes in real life situations, where the person interacts with the environment. A complementary alternative to the physical performance tests is to assess the individual's perception on how pain affects his or her daily life by using self-reported measures. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0). This is a generic assessment instrument that links directly to the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) and captures the level of functioning in six domains: i) cognition, ii) mobility, iii) self-care, iv) getting along, v) life activities and vi) participation. Its use allows the characterization of the individual's perceived impact of pain on several daily life domains. 15 Therefore, the instrument supports the investigation of associations between aspects of pain and disability; and, allows a broader characterization of how pain impacts different areas of functioning and whether different pain characteristics impact function differently. This is relevant as a greater insight into which pain characteristics are more strongly associated with changes in specific areas of functioning may provide crucial information to improve pain assessment and management and to prevent the deleterious effect of pain on function. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence of the association between symptoms, such as pain, and function, suggesting that measuring function may be sufficient for capturing the combined effects of conditions on an individual's capabilities without having to capture information on symptoms, body structures and body functions, depending on the purpose of the study. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between pain duration, frequency, intensity, and number of pain sites and self-reported disability in 6 domains of daily life for patients with musculoskeletal pain aged 50 years or older, when controlling for age, sex, level of education, depression and number of comorbid chronic conditions. Methods Participants Participants were consecutive patients attending three different Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics in the region of Aveiro, Portugal. We believe that the population served by these clinics is heterogeneous as they cover i) both urban and rural areas, ii) traumatic and non-traumatic disorders and iii) different sub-systems within the Portuguese health system. Subjects could be enrolled in the study if the main reason for attending the Clinic was pain related to a musculoskeletal disorder, were ≥50 years old, and were able to give written informed consent. This age cut point was used as a previous study 8 has shown that the extent to which pain interferes with everyday life increases incrementally with age from 50 years old up to ≥80 years old. Subjects with central nervous system disorders or amputation were excluded from participation. The patients were personally invited by the investigators to participate in the study. The study received Ethical approval from the Service of Bioethics and Medical Ethics, Porto University, Portugal. All participants signed an informed consent prior to their participation. Procedures All subjects were interviewed once and underwent the following assessments: Demographic and health characteristics Demographic and health characteristics included age, sex, number of years of formal education and presence of chronic non-musculoskeletal disorders. The presence of the latest was ascertained by asking participants whether they had any of the following conditions: i) hypertension, ii) diabetes, iii) cardiovascular disorders, iv) respiratory disorders, v) cancer, vi) other known medical condition or vii) any medical condition for which the nature/medical diagnosis was not known. The total number of reported comorbid chronic conditions was counted. Pain intensity, frequency, duration and number of pain sites Pain intensity was measured using a 10 cm vertical numeric graphic rating scale, with 0 for no pain and 10 for the most severe pain imaginable. Number of pain sites and pain location were assessed using a body chart and participants were asked to mark on the drawing where pain was felt. The number of pain sites was then counted and categorized as 1) single pain site, 2) two pain sites, 3) 3 or more pain sites but not meeting the criteria for widespread pain and 4) widespread pain. Widespread pain was defined as pain in the left and right side of the body, pain above and below the waist and axial-skeletal pain. 16 Participants with pain in more than one site, were asked to rate both the global intensity of pain and the intensity of the worst pain. Pain frequency during the week before the interview was assessed by asking participants to choose one of the following options: 1) seldom (once a week), 2) occasionally (2–3 times a week), 3) often (more than 3 times a week) or 4) always (all days). To characterize pain duration participants were asked for how long they felt pain and answers were categorized as 1) <6 months and 2) ≥6 months. These measurements were conducted in line with published guidelines for pain assessment in older people. 17 Depressive symptoms Depressive symptoms were assessed using the short version of the Portuguese translation of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), 18 a valid and reliable 15 item self-report scale of depression initially developed for adults aged 65 years or more. 19 However, a recent study 20 showed that its level of sensitivity and specificity for patients aged less than 65 is comparable to that of patients aged more than 65 years. Therefore, GDS was adopted in this study. Participants are asked to respond by answering yes or no to each of the 15 items. Ten items indicate the presence of depression when answered positively and 5 indicate depression when answered negatively. For descriptive analysis, results were dichotomized as 1) no depressive symptoms (4 points or less) and 2) depressive symptoms (5 points or more). 20 Disability Disability was assessed using the Portuguese version of the 36-item interview administered version of WHODAS 2.0, which is valid and reliable. 21 The WHODAS 2.0 is a disability assessment instrument based on the conceptual framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) with a recall period of 30 days. 15 It provides a global measure of disability and 6 domain-specific scores: 1) Understanding and Communicating (6 items), 2) Getting around (5 items), 3) Self-care (4 items), 4) Getting along with others (5 items), 5a) Life activities: household (4 items), 5b) Life activities: work/school (4 items), and 6) Participation in society (8 items). Response options range from 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (extreme difficulty or unable to do). WHODAS 2 scores were computed according to the item response theory method of scoring as indicated in the manual for WHODAS 2.0. 15 This included i) summing of recoded item scores within each domain, ii) summing of all domain scores and 3) converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of disability. The manual considers that a summary score can be calculated from all the items (36) or from all except the Life activities – work/school – when this domain does not apply (32 items). Both summary scores are comparable. 15 For descriptive analysis, WHODAS scores were interpreted using the International Classification of Functioning Scale: no disability (0–4%), mild disability (5–24%), moderate disability (25–49%), severe disability (50–95%) and complete disability (96–100%). 22 Statistical analysis The PAWS software (IBM, New York) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample in terms of sex, age, level of education, marital status, occupation, comorbid chronic conditions, WHODAS 2.0 scores and pain characteristics. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported for continuous variables and count and proportion were reported for categorical variables. The relationship between ordinal (pain frequency) and continuous variables (number of pain sites, pain intensity, GDS score, number of comorbid chronic conditions and years of education) and WHODAS 2.0 scores was calculated using Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficients, respectively. Differences in WHODAS 2.0 score for dichotomous variables (sex and depression) were investigated using t-tests. A correlation matrix for all independent variables was performed to assess collinearity and inform the regression model. Stepwise regression analyses were performed with domain and total WHODAS 2.0 scores as the dependent variable. In addition to pain characteristics (pain intensity, pain duration, pain frequency and number of pain sites), age, sex, years of formal education, GDS scores and number of comorbid chronic conditions were also entered in the model for each of the six domains and total score. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Sample characteristics A total of 204 participants entered the study. Participant's age varied between 50 and 90 years (mean = 65.93; SD = 9.11) and 71.6% (n = 146) were females. A detailed characterization of participants is presented in Table 1 . Pain characteristics More than 50% of the study sample reported pain in 2 or more sites. Nearly one-third of the sample reported widespread pain (29.9%) that was always present in the week preceding data collection (90.2%). Only 22.5% of participants reported that their pain duration was less than 6 months. Mean pain intensity for the most painful site (mean = 6.28; SD = 2.13) was significantly different (t = 6.42, p < 0.001) from mean global pain intensity (mean = 5.91; SD = 2.02). The pain locations reported most frequently were the lumbar region (59.3%) and the lower limbs (56.4%) (Table 2 ). Disability The mean total WHODAS 2.0 score was 28.06 and SD was 19.86, revealing moderate disability. This was calculated without the scores of domain 5.2 (work) as 63.0% of patients did not endorse this domain. Individual domain scores indicate mild disability for cognition (domain 1), self-care (domain 3) and getting along (domain 4), moderate disability for domains getting around (domain 2), work (domain 5.2) and participation (domain 6) and severe disability for household activities (domain 5). Disability scores were highest in the life activities-household domain, followed by scores in life activities-work and getting around domains, respectively. The lowest disability was reported for getting along (Table 3 ). Associations Correlations between WHODAS 2.0 scores and pain intensity, pain frequency, number of pain sites, number of chronic conditions and years of formal education are presented in Table 4 . Global pain intensity and intensity of the most painful site demonstrate the highest correlations with WHODAS 2.0 scores. However, all the remaining variables were significantly correlated with at least 3 domains of WHODAS. WHODAS scores according to sex and pain duration are presented in Table 5 . Cognition (domain 1) and getting along (domain 4) were significantly more impaired in patients that reported chronic pain. Cognition (domain 1), getting along (domain 4) and household (domain 5.1) were significantly more impaired in females than males. The intercorrelation matrix revealed that global pain intensity and intensity for the most painful site were highly correlated (r = 0.92), suggesting collinearity. Therefore only global pain intensity was included in the regression analysis. The correlation coefficients between the remaining variables were ≤0.44. Linear regression models Table 6 shows the results of the multiple linear regression analysis. Global pain intensity emerged as the most important predictor of WHODAS 2.0 scores, being present in the final model for total score and for all domains except cognition (domain 1) and getting along (domain 4). Furthermore, it was the most important predictor for getting around, self-care, household activities and work and total score. Frequency was not included in any of the models; pain duration was included in the final model for household activities (domain 5.1), and number of pain sites was included in the final model for cognition (domain 1) and getting around (domain 2). Depression also emerged as an important predictor present in the final model for all domains except work (domain 5.2) and in the model for the total score, being the most important predictor for cognition, getting along and participation. In the final model of predictors for WHODAS 2.0 scores only global pain intensity and depression were statistically significant, explaining 23% of the variance. Global pain intensity alone explained 19% of WHODAS 2.0 scores variance. Discussion This is the first study exploring the association between global pain intensity, duration, frequency and number of pain sites on several domains of self-reported disability measured by WHODAS 2.0 in patients presenting to a rehabilitation clinic due to musculoskeletal pain. Results show that global pain intensity, number of pain sites and pain duration are the pain characteristics associated with disability. Number of pain sites is a predictor of disability for the domains of cognition and getting around, pain duration is a predictor of disability for the domain of household activities and pain intensity is a predictor of disability for all domains of life assessed by the WHODAS 2.0 except cognition and getting along. This indicates that pain is associated with disability for several domains of life. Furthermore, global pain intensity explains more of the variance of WHODAS 2.0 scores compared to other pain characteristics and appears to be the most important predictor of disability for getting around, self-care, household activities and work and total score. This indicates that global pain intensity is a better indicator of the level of disability than pain duration or number of pain sites. Another important predictor of functioning in individuals with musculoskeletal pain receiving treatment for their complaints is the GDS score. While it is unknown whether pain was causally attributable to depression in this study (since this was a cross-sectional study), it has been shown that depression is related to both pain and function, so it was important to control for depression in the models. 23 A qualitative study exploring how pain complicates disability according to the patients' perspective shows that participants tend to refer more often to pain severity than other pain characteristics when explaining how pain interferes with their daily life. The distress and daily losses associated with pain evoke a range of emotional responses, which include depression. 24 Our results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies. Scudds and Robertson 25 found that pain intensity is more strongly associated with self-reported disability than pain frequency and number of pain sites in a sample of community-dwelling seniors. Also Gheldof et al 26 found pain intensity to be a strong predictor of self-reported disability (beta = 0.69, p < 0.001) in a sample of 890 working employees reporting at least 1 day of back pain during the past year. In addition, a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial that manipulated pain intensity by administering opioid analgesics to patients with chronic back pain, found that the acute administration of opioid analgesics improved lifting performance between 15% and 48%. Improvements in exercise performance were attributed to reduced pain intensity, implicating pain as an important influence on functional capacity evaluation. 27 In contrast, Lichtenstein et al 28 found that pain location is more strongly associated with self-reported disability than pain intensity in a population-based sample of participants aged 65–72 years old. However, in the present study we did not test for pain location, only for number of pain sites. Therefore, results are difficult to compare. WHODAS total mean score indicates that the sample was moderately disabled. Individual scores for each domain indicate that participants were only mildly disabled for the cognition, self-care and getting along domains. Previous studies have shown that these domains are the least affected in patients with osteoarthritis, low back pain, multiple sclerosis or chronic widespread pain. 29,30 Mean scores for all domains in our study are also similar to those presented in these studies. This may be due to the high percentage of patients with low back pain, lower limb pain and chronic widespread pain in the sample of the present study. Implications for clinicians The results suggest that global pain intensity, and not only pain intensity at the most painful site, should be included in routine clinical assessment of patients with musculoskeletal pain as it is an important predictor of self-reported disability. Clinicians should also assess pain-related disability for several domains of life, including cognition, getting around, self-care, household activities, work and participation and depression should be assessed and considered when planning treatment. In addition, results suggest that treatment interventions aiming at decreasing global pain intensity rather than pain at a specific location may be more successful in decreasing pain associated disability than site-specific treatments. This should be investigated by future studies. Study limitations The results of this study need to be seen in light of its limitations. This is a cross-sectional study that uses patients with musculoskeletal pain that actively sought treatment for their pain. People with musculoskeletal pain from the general population may respond differently to pain and pain-related interference. The cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow inferences on causal relationships between pain and disability. In addition, pain intensity and self-reported disability refer to different periods of assessment as participants were asked to report on pain intensity for the previous week and disability for the previous 30 days. It is unknown whether these different periods of recall for the main variables of interest may affect the results. However, the risk of bias in recall of pain is a threat to the validity of any study and a longer period of recall was not advisable. The effect of comorbidities on disability may be biased as our data on the number of comorbidities is based on participants' self-report. Causes of musculoskeletal pain were not ascertained and therefore it was not possible to subgroup participants according to this information. Conclusion Most patients with musculoskeletal pain seeking treatment present with multisite pain. Global pain intensity seems to be an important predictor of disability in these patients for several domains of daily life. Therefore, global pain intensity should be included in routine clinical assessment of these patients and pain-related disability should be assessed for several domains of daily life. Nonetheless, future studies should investigate whether interventions aiming at decreasing global pain intensity are more successful in decreasing pain associated disability than site-specific treatments.

        "doc_abstract": "Background: Cognitive deficits are among the most disabling of neurological diseases and have a serious impact on the quality of life of patients and families. Cognitive training has been proven successful in improving or compensating for neuropsychological deficits after acute brain injury, but its efficacy highly depends on the intensity of treatment over an extended period of time. Therefore, cognitive training indicates expensive human resources and renders the rehabilitation process vulnerable to physical and economic barriers for the majority of patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test a new Web-based rehabilitation tool that provides intensive cognitive training at home under clinical prescription and monitoring, at affordable costs. Methods: From a pool of 60 original exercises, designed and used over the past 10 years for cognitive training at our center, we developed 27 exercises on a computer game format, with automatic increase or decrease of difficulty levels. These exercises were assembled in a clean, user-friendly design and covered various cognitive domains such as attention (n=4), memory (n=11), language (n=3), calculus (n=3), praxis (n=2), and executive functions (n=3). A Web 2.0 platform was also designed to provide medical prescription of cognitive training sessions, performed at the patient's home. These sessions included continuous monitoring of compliance, performance, and evolution; algorithms for automatic adjustment and long-term learning through use, and database recording of all activities. The end-user interaction test included 80 patients from our memory clinic from several groups including subjective memory complaints (n=20), traumatic brain injury (n=20), stroke and other static brain lesions (n=20), and mild Alzheimer's disease (n=20). During a 1-hour session, patients and their relatives were taught to use the system and allowed to practice using it. At the end of the session, they were asked to complete a questionnaire. Results: A total of 48/80 patients (60%) attended the training session. The mean age of the patients was 60 years (SD 13.3, range 41-78), and the mean level of formal education was 6 years (range 4-16). Of all the participants, 32/48 patients (66%) have previously used a computer. All patients and their relatives made a positive evaluation of the cognitive training tool. Only 2/48 patients (4%) were not interested in performing the exercises at home; 19/48 patients (39%) mentioned the need for further coaching from a relative or health care professional. The patients who mentioned difficulties in performing the exercises have not used the computer earlier. Conclusions: This new Web-based system was very well accepted by patients and their relatives, who showed high levels of motivation to use it on a daily basis at home. The simplicity of its use and comfort were especially outlined. This tool will have an important effect on human resource management, in increasing the patient access to specialized health care and improving the quality and national health system costs of rehabilitation programs.",

METHODS: The original, 36 item version of the WHODAS 2.0, administered through an interview, was translated into Portuguese following international guidelines and tested on 9 participants from the general population. The Portuguese version was then administered to 204 patients with musculoskeletal pain. The patients' socio-demographic and health data were collected, as were the number of sites where they were experiencing pain and the intensity of that pain. The WHODAS 2.0 was administered again by a second interviewer within three days to determine its inter-rater reliability. Construct validity was assessed according to the ability of WHODAS 2.0 to discriminate between patients with different numbers of pain sites and the correlation between WHODAS 2.0 scores and pain intensity. Internal consistency was also assessed. RESULTS: The Portuguese version of the WHODAS 2.0 is easily understood and has good internal consistency (α = 0.84), as well as, very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.95). In addition, it was able to detect statistically significant differences between patients with different numbers of pain sites (p < 0.01) and showed that higher levels of disability are associated with more intense pain (r = 0.44, p < 0.01), indicating that it has construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: The Portuguese version of the WHODAS 2.0 has shown to be reliable and valid when administered to patients with musculoskeletal pain.",

Introduction The approval of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) [1] by the World Health Organization (WHO) has marked a paradigm shift in the way health and disability are understood and measured [2]. The ICF describes the health and health-related states of an individual and indicates the positive and negative aspects of the interaction between the individual (with a health condition) and the contextual factors (environmental and personal). Until ICF publication, disability has been seen as an unrelated entity that imposes restriction on the individual. ICF has brought these concepts into a comprehensive whole of multiple dimensions of human functioning, such as biological, psychological, social and environmental [2]. Previous concepts, like Design for All, also emphasize the impact of the surrounding environment in the functionality of individuals. This perspective changes how care is provided, and empowers people as part involved in the care provision motivation to control participation and develop skills to adapt and to influence the environment. This approach underlines the role of participation and control, supporting functionality versus disability [3]. This enabling perspective is one of the premises of active aging, as it corresponds to the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age [4]. In order to contribute to a greater overall functionality of the individual, the use of software and complex systems can be decisive to assist the elderly in all areas of life. These products and services play a key role in the interaction of users with the surrounding environment. In order to make this products and services easily usable and adapted to users, it is crucial that the development and evaluation process happens according to it is essential that the functionality of individuals and the environment where they conduct their lives is contemplated in the development and evaluation of such products or services, thereby insuring their suitability. However, the current state of development is still mostly oriented to a ICF arises as a possible conceptual model for the development and evaluation of environmental factors such as products or services. In this paper we intend to describe the base fundamentals of this proposal, as well as present some results concerning a practical implementation of this methodology. This paper consists of four sections: 1) Introduction: exposition of the problem; 2) Background: overview of the conceptual modal of ICF; 3) A practical implementation using an ICF based methodology: brief methodology description and presentation of an illustrative application example using a Telerehabilitation service and 4) Conclusions: final considerations and presentation of suggestions for future work. 2. Background 2.1. International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health The ICF is one of the international classifications developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its general objective is to provide a unified and standardized language as well as a framework for the description of health and health-related states. The ICF is a hierarchical classification based on the perspective of the body, individual and society, organized in two parts; (1) functionality and disability, (2) contextual factors. Each part is subdivided into two components, the first, functionality and disability, includes body functions and structures and activities and participation. The second, contextual factors, is divided into personal factors and environmental factors [1]. In this classification, functionality indicates the positive aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a particular health condition) and the contextual factors (environmental and personal) [1]. On the opposite, in negative terms, disability refers to the generic term for disabilities, limitations in activity and participation restrictions. The utilization of ICF allows a complete and multidisciplinary 295 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 293 â€“ 300 approach focused on the individual [5]. The ICF model replaces the negative focus of impairment and disability, by a neutral perspective embracing all components that promote or hinder the execution of their functions, both biological and social [1, 6] . With this paradigm shift, the disease is no longer seen as the only responsible for disability and impairments, but as one of the factors influencing health, such as environmental factors, social and personal factors [7]. The ICF evidence the importance of interaction between the health condition, the individual and the surrounding environment. Figure1 presents the spectrum of interactions between the components of ICF. The environment is crucial in attenuation or elimination of the disability caused by injuries that occur as a result of adverse health conditions. In ICF, an environmental factor is classified as a facilitator if contributes to increase users performance and participation. On the other hand, if an environmental factor restricts user performance and participation, then it is classified as a barrier. Different environments can have a distinct impact on the same individual with a specific health condition. An environment with barriers, restricts the individual's performance, on the other hand, other environments with facilitators improve his functionality [1]. For example, barriers to mobility in the home context may limit an individual's ability to carry out activities (for example stairs or ports), the same happens with the mobility barriers in the community context (for example, irregular sidewalks) that may limit involvement in community activities [8]. Conversely, products to support mobility (for example, canes and wheelchairs) may enhance the person's participation in daily activities by providing physical assistance in performing specific tasks. Similarly, transport facilitators (for example, availability of a car or public transport) can enable greater participation in community activities [8]. Environmental factors are organized in the ICF in two distinct levels [1]: home, workplace, among others. This level includes, apart from environmental materials, direct contact with other individuals, such as family members; laws and government bodies. Fig. 1 - Interactions between the components of ICF. The functionality of an individual in a particular area is a complex interaction or relationship between health condition and the contextual factors. There is a dynamic interaction between these entities: an intervention in an element can potentially modify one or more other elements. These interactions are specific and operate in all directions [1]. 296 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 293 â€“ 300 The personal factors are not yet classified in the ICF due to the high social and cultural variety among subjects. Recent studies reveal that there is a growing recognition that the role of environmental factors changed the problematic and, consequently, the focus of intervention, disability is no longer understood as a single category, but rather the result of an interaction between an individual's health condition and environmental factors [9]. It is essential that the environment where an individual lives is inclusive. Ensure full accessibility is an essential aspect of the quality of life of all citizens. A fully facilitator environment enable all people to have equal opportunities for participation in all aspects of life in society. Creating an inclusive environment manufacturers, and political leaders. To achieve this, all that is designed, in particular, the surroundings, the everyday life, culture and information, should be developed considering the concept of Design for All [10]. This concept aims to develop social inclusion and equality considering human diversity enabling all people to have equal opportunities for participation in all aspects of life in society. Design for All approach should apply to the development of [10]: impact on mobility, work and leisure within the community); standards); rfaces (development of services, products and systems that eliminate social exclusion and functional difficulties of individuals); prejudices and other negative social attitudes). The elderly emerges as obvious beneficiaries of a physical, social and atitudinal facilitator environment. Ageing affects all areas of life of an individual and causes several disabilities, including limitations in terms of mobility, sensory deficits, and increase susceptibility to diseases, particularly chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and dementias [11]. The age pyramid inversion and the increased number of elderly, evidence even more the need to make the services and products, and consequently the environment, accessible to this population. 3. A practical implementation using an ICF based methodology The paradigm introduced with ICF is inclusive and universal, so it favors not only the old people, as well as all others, whether they have a limitation or not [10, 12]. The characteristics of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are appropriate to fulfil elderly needs as it refers to concepts, products or services that interconnect and improve new technologies and social systems, with the aim of promoting the quality of life of all people during all stages of their lives [13]. AAL enables the utilization of products and technologies and the provision of distance services such as health care, helping to achieve autonomy, independence and dignity [12]. The Living Usability Lab (LUL) intends to develop AAL services to fulfil some needs that are common to older adults: full participation in society, health and quality of life or living with security [14]. The LUL is essentially an interactive environment to facilitate the research, development, integration, validation and evaluation of multimodal, adaptability and user monitoring technologies, new modes of interaction and new services supported by new generation networks using a strong involvement of users for the specification of new services. A central idea of the Living Lab concept is a strong involvement of the users in all the development phases, including the conceptual design and, later, the prototypes. This method allows a more realistic validation of environmental factors centered in the user. Therefore, the living Lab approach seems to be a good method to evaluate environmental factors is this perspective because it is in line with the ICF approach as both adopt a holistic perspective of user involvement. Therefore, new evaluation methodologies are required to allow the 297 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 293 â€“ 300 generating of new design solutions and the evaluation of design solutions derived from the first phases of user involvement. A major problem inherent in the development of AAL products and services is its validation. Only through and developing guidelines for users and developers [15]. The utilization of AAL products and services aims to improve people's participation and performance in carrying out activities i.e., improve the individuals functionality. Because AAL products and services intent to change the personal environment surrounding, in order to improve individuals participation, they should be considered as environmental factors in an ICF approach. In fact, if an individual is surrounded with services and products tailored to their characteristics, he will be able to reach a higher level of functionality. Accordingly, the ICF may arise as a conceptual model for the holistic development of a methodology for evaluation of environmental factors and, consequently, AAL products and services. Using the ICF as a framework to develop instruments for the evaluation of environmental factors permits that the terminology, concepts and coded information can be aggregated with the available information, and can also be used as a comprehensive model to characterize users and their contexts, activities and participation [16]. Therefore, the ICF can be used to specify, develop and characterize AAL products and services, as well as to develop appropriate tools to assess them and their imp [16]. Generally, in the development of AAL products or services, experts define which functions and services should be used and how the user should interact with the product or service. The prototypes, based on those conceptual design ideas, are then evaluated by users. Therefore, this approach is inadequate for the development of such services and products because the initial design ideas are not based on the mindsets, experiences and mental models of the users as in a living lab approach [14]. Under the Living Usability Lab project we have defined a methodology and created some evaluation tools for evaluation of AAL services according to a Living Lab perspective, based on the ICF. This evaluation methodology assumes three phases of reference. The first phase is the conceptual validation, followed by a prototype test, and finally a pilot test. Those phases are not isolated, and they are based on a spiral approach that follows the development progress since the beginning [14]. The first phase of evaluation, conceptual validation, aims to determine if an idea of a product or service is sustainable in terms of interface and functions. In prototype test, the second phase of the evaluation, it is Fig. 2. Phases of reference of the Living Lab methodology 298 Ana Isabel Martins et al. / Procedia Computer Science 14 ( 2012 ) 293 â€“ 300 intended to collect information regarding the usability and user satisfaction. At this phase there is already a physical implementation of the product or service prototype in order to be tested by users. The prototype test is conducted in a controlled environment. Finally, the third phase of evaluation, pilot test, intends to evaluate, in For this reason, this last phase of testing differs from the prototype phase in the context where it happens. The product The phases of reference in the Living Lab methodology are present in Figure 2. 3.1. An illustrative application example using a Telerahabilitation service The ICF based evaluation methodology was first used to evaluate the TeleRehabilitation service under develop in the LUL project [17, 18]. In general terms, the TeleRehabilitation service allows supervised remote exercise sessions, as a way to maintaining health and prevent illness [18]. The results of a first effort to evaluate an AAL service, the Telerehabilitaion service, possible to use ICF as a conceptual framework to evaluate environmental products in a Living Lab approach. It was conducted an exploratory pretest to assess the evaluation tools adequacy based on the ICF, developed in this methodology. Although the results seemed to point toward a good measure to discriminate facilitators and barriers, the instrument was not sensitive to recognize why a particular component or feature acted as a facilitator or barrier. Tests held revealed a difficulty in identifying the reason why a particular component or characteristic of a component is identified as a barrier [14]. Thus, we suggest that, whenever a component is identified as a barrier, a set of predefined categories should be presented and the user should mark the ones that correspond to the reason why this component acts as a barrier. This selection should be complete with additional written information. This procedure enables the developers to identify what changes to perform on the product or service in order to make it more adapted to users, and must be performed for all the components identified as a barrier. 2 How would you characterize the components present in the service?

The reason why this component acts as a barrier is reflected in the category 1 (icons size) and completed in the additional information (small size). it can be useful to define priority in the development progress of the environmental factors, both in terms of Another advantage of this specification is the possibility to match the barriers identified with the characteristics of users, verifying p component features as barriers. The gradation of facilitators may also be important because it permits the definition of good practices regarding the development of environmental factors. If a particular component or feature of an environmental factor is repeatedly identified as a facilitator in similar products or services then it may have the potential to be a good practice for services of the same type. 4. Conclusion The development of new products and services should promote the participation of all in society, such as people with disabilities, elderly or any other. A holistic approach is necessary to understand these special needs and to contribute to an inclusive society. The ICF describes the health and health-related states of an individual in a holistic way as it participation and, in the context of quality of life, health and security, this products and services can be relevant. Therefore, developing and classifying AAL products and services, using the ICF language, may facilitate communication between different intervenient interested in AAL products and services. Since the current stage of development/evaluation of AAL products and services is still very technology-oriented [19] and its functionality has not been addressed adequately, we have developed assessment tools that address the The first tests held showed that ICF seems to be useful in a first level of screening, discriminating facilitators and barriers. In order to address this, we have completed the instruments with categories that help us to understand the reason why a certain component of the environmental factor acts as a facilitator or a barrier. This allow us to collect more and more significant information in order to understand what changes should be performed in the environmental factor in order to make it more adapted to its users so it can enhance their functionality contributing to a higher participation in the society, a better performance and an improved quality of life. In addition, this methodological option can also be useful to guide the definition of good practices. This is a very characteristics. The verification of possible relationships between groups of users and the identification of certain components as barriers or environment. The definition of a conceptual model for the evaluation of environmental factors is still in a very early stage of development and the ICF based assessment tools still needs further work in order to verify the general applicability of this methodology and determinate the validity and reliability.

The concept of Design for All emphasizes the impact of the surrounding environment in the individual's functionality. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health brought the concepts of functionality and disability into a comprehensive whole of multiple dimensions of human functioning, such as biological, psychological, social and environmental. In order to contribute to a greater overall functionality of the individual, the use of software and complex systems can be decisive to assist the people with special needs in all areas of life. The paradigm introduced with ICF is inclusive and universal, so it favors not only the old people, but all others, whether they have a limitation or not. The characteristics of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are appropriate to fulfill elderly needs. However, the current state of development is still mostly oriented to a technological perspective, where the individual's functionality has not been fully addressed. Under the Living Usability Lab project we have defined a methodology and created some evaluation tools for assessment of AAL services according to a Living Lab perspective, based on the ICF. In this paper we intend to describe the base fundamentals of this proposal, as well as present some results concerning a practical implementation of this methodology.

Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL and PEDro databases was conducted using a pre-determined search strategy. The identified instruments were screened independently by two investigators, and meaningful concepts were linked to the most precise ICF category according to published linking rules. Results: Six instruments were included, containing 526 meaningful concepts. Instruments had between 20% and 98% of items linked to categories in Chapter 1. The highest percentage of items from one instrument linked to categories in Chapters 2-5 varied between 9% and 50%. The presence or absence of environmental factors in a specific context is assessed in 3 instruments, while the other 3 assess the intensity of the impact of environmental factors. Discussion: Instruments differ in their content, type of assessment, and have several items linked to the same ICF category. Most instruments primarily assess products and technology (Chapter 1), highlighting the need to deepen the discussion on the theory that supports the measurement of environmental factors. This discussion should be thorough and lead to the development of methodologies and new tools that capture the underlying concepts of the ICF.© 2012 The Authors.",

        "doc_abstract": "We made a cross-sectional study aimed at 50 professionals (18 doctors, 32 nurses) of a terciary hospital Internal Medicine (IM) ward, focusing the relevant knowledge in various areas of Patient-Centered Care in Chronic Disease: symptom control, pharmacology and palliative prognostic discussion. Almost 98% believe that most patients need strategies for symptomatic care, which died in hospital in considerable suffering (68%). Provision of palliative care in the community was rarely established with the primary health team. 90% were favourable on the creation of a hospital palliative care team. Around 57% find essential to prognosticate before thinking about mitigation strategies. While 75% of professionals had already discussed end-of-life directives with, at least, one patient, only one case could be formalized in writing. The rate of use of scales for assessing the intensity of pain was less than 50% and 38% did not indicate major opioids for the treatment of moderate intensity pain. These were considered contra-indicated for relief of dyspnoea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by 20% of professionals and 55% of those were unaware that its use and titration is governed by the same principles used in pain control. Around 44% of the respondents had already used the subcutaneous route for administration of drugs and 58% for hydration. Despite the team recognition of the potential for suffering of patients and the need for mitigation strategies, they remain linked to prognosis and not to symptomatic complexity. There are gaps in regard to control of pain, dyspnoea and in continuity of care. © 2010 CELOM.",

Women's mean age was 27.6 years. Positive criteria for digital cervicography were identified in 111 positive cases with pre-cancerous cervical lesions (100%) and in 8 cases classified as false positives (2.6%). Evaluations 1 and 2 classified the tests as positive (163; 54.3%) and suspected (146; 48.6%), respectively. According to the findings, digital cervicography was more sensitive (99.1%) and cytology more specific (100%). Digital cervicography sensitivity increased by 4.5 times when the positive criteria were applied as compared to cytology alone, besides involving low cost, thus suggesting that it is a. viable technique.",

Nevertheless, a home support service called SAD (Serviço de Apoio Domiciliário—Domiciliary Support Service), provided by non-profit institutions to the elderly population is believed to be a first approach to integrated care. Purpose: The aim of this work is to describe and discuss the services provided by the institutions that participate in SAD and understand if this service is the first step in a change towards integrated care. Data source: The main data sources were documents provided by institutions like INE (Instituto Nacional de Estatística—National Institute of Statistics) and a questionnaire that was submitted to 75 institutions in order to capture: (a) demographic and structural data; (b) the type of information that the professionals need to fulfil their jobs and (c) the kind of relationship and constraints, if they exist, to better integration, between the institutions that provide SAD and the patients, the social and health systems, and other entities. Conclusion and discussion: SAD seems to have been promoting a formal collaboration between several entities in the social and health systems. The information shared between these institutions has increased, but where cooperation in care service provision is concerned this seldom surpasses the social bounds because health care is still difficult to integrate.",

To date, however, few people with more severe intellectual disabilities have benefited from these opportunities. Many such persons can, with systematic instruction, rapidly learn complex work tasks, but need long-term support to maintain an acceptable level of performance over time. We describe a new system, based on a 'palmtop' computer, to assist people with severe intellectual disabilities to perform complex work tasks. Using the system, a worker with severe intellectual disabilities uses a radically simplified palmtop computer to access a series of pictorial instructions guiding him/her through the steps in a task. For users who may become distracted from job tasks, devices similar to a commercial radio-pager remind the user to request the next instruction after a pre-set time has expired since the previous instruction. Should the user not respond to the prompt, the job coach or supervisor receives a similar alert. We present data from a series of six single case experiments in which the system was evaluated in use by workers with severe intellectual disabilities in real work settings. The results show that the system supports higher levels of work accuracy and pace than simpler support systems such as booklets of picture instructions, and that the prompting capacity of the system is useful to workers who may become distracted from job tasks. In addition, the capacity of the system to deliver instructions in clusters tailored to the needs of the individual user increases the utility of the system for persons with varying support needs.",

The new system, which was small and battery powered, could provide auditory and vibratory prompts in addition to pictorial instructions concerning the task steps. To control for the effects of the computer-based system, the subjects were also exposed to a card system. The results showed that the subjects had a significantly higher level of correct performance on the tasks presented with the computer-based system than on the tasks presented with the card system. Two of the subjects, moreover, seemed to prefer the computer-based system to the card system.",

A proposal is presented for an integrated network management system, suitable for such a heterogeneous scenario, that will hide the differences of the underlying LANs.
