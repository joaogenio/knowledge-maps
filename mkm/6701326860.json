Keywords 5G+ Cascaded channel Channel estimation Convolutional neural networks FPGA 1 Introduction In the literature, the wireless cascaded channel has gained attention, mainly due to its deployment in different communication scenarios [1–10]. Indeed, the wireless cascaded channel has been considered for cooperative vehicular [1], satellite [2] and multihop communications systems, relay stations [3–7], and in the context of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) [8–10] for example. Cascaded channels are subject to phenomena such as multipath scattering, time dispersion and Doppler shift between the different links, which impose great challenges in relation to the channel estimation processing function in the receiver. Thus, over the years, new estimation techniques have been proposed in order to deal with these issues and improve the global network performance, given the impact of the channel estimation processing function on it. In [3] for example, the performance analysis for multiple-relay amplify and-forward (AF) cooperative system over fading channels, with imperfect channel estimation, is presented. The authors in [3] demonstrate that a minimal imperfection in the channel estimation influences directly the overall performance of a system containing multiple-relay. Regarding works that address practical and theoretical cascaded channel estimators, the authors in [4] use a predefined pilot matrix sequence in order to improve the channel estimation performance in a two-hop relay system using the least squares (LS) algorithm. In [5], a channel estimation process for dual hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) relay networks is described, in which an iterative algorithm was enhanced in order to reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, in [6,7], new algorithms are proposed to decrease the channel estimation operation overhead in OFDM relay networks, due to the necessary number of N channel estimations. Recently, encouraged by the significant advances of deep learning (DL), several studies have applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for wireless communication processing functions, including the channel estimation [11,12]. In this context, it is worth mentioning that DL is interesting given the ability to automatically extract the underlying representative characteristics of wireless communications. In addition, when compared with traditional methods for channel estimation, DL has the advantage of recognizing some patterns that mathematical algorithms cannot describe well, such as unknown and complex channel models, and non-linear problems. In 2004, the authors in [13] introduce machine learning (ML) for nonlinear channel estimation in MIMO systems, in which a new method for multiple variable regression estimation based on support vector machines (SVM) was developed. More recently, O'Shea and Hoydis [12] exposes the DL potential for the physical layer (PHY), highlighting the neural networks (NNs) ability to learn and compute the typical PHY processing functions. In [14], deep NNs were applied to the channel estimation and signal detection processing functions, in which a DL model was first trained offline to learn the channel distortion and interference statistics and then used for recovering the transmitted data. Furthermore, in [15], the power of CNNs to deal with the channel estimation function was demonstrated considering a fast fading communication channel. In [16], the authors describe the robustness of a CNN to the channel estimation for massive MIMO systems with pilot contamination. Kang, Chun and Kim shown in [17] that the CNNs are competent to perform the channel estimation function for MIMO systems with received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feedback in two fading scenarios, namely: quasi-static block and time-varying. In addition, exploring the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond (5G+) trends, the results in [18] show that the deep CNNs are also effective in millimeter waves (mmWaves) massive MIMO systems. Also regarding 5G, it is investigated in [19,20] the influence of spatial correlation, Doppler shift and reference signal resource allocation in the channel estimation. The first one uses a two-dimensional (2D) CNNs architecture based on U-net, and a 3D CNNs architecture for handling spatial correlation. The last work uses a novel CNNs architecture to deal with various combinations of delay and doppler spread. Motivated by the proven potential of the CNNs to perform channel estimation, in this paper we go further and study the benefits of CNN-based channel estimation processing function concerning particularly wireless cascaded channels in 5G+ systems, without forward error correction (FEC) codes. Each individual and independent link of the cascaded channel is characterized as a tapped delay line (TDL), typically the considered model in 5G networks. In addition, in contrast to the methodologies adopted in [5–7], in which the channel estimation is performed after each one of the links of the relay system, the proposed CNN estimator reduces these operations to only one in the receiver. That is, the algorithm proposed replaces the iterative process of conventional estimators and, consequently, reduces the overall complexity. In this study, the quality of the channel estimation processing function is evaluated by the mean squared error (MSE) metric and the overall performance of the system is assessed through the bit error rate (BER). The major contributions of this work are summarized as follows: • We propose to overcome the challenges in cascaded wireless channels estimation (multipath scattering, time dispersion and Doppler shift between the different links) by a CNN model. CNNs proved to be an advantageous channel gain estimator compared to the classical LS algorithm. • We propose in this study to reduce the receiver complexity concerning the N wireless cascaded channel estimation processing functions. This complexity reduction is performed in the sense of the number of estimations, in which N estimators for each individual channel turn into one operation with CNNs, thus avoiding the iterations of conventional estimators, making it less expensive while maintaining a good performance. • We adopted the TDL channel model, applied to 5G wireless communication scenarios, making this study an important contribution for several use cases related to 5G networks. • We propose a CNN architecture optimized for wireless 5G cascaded channels, take into account a reasonable compromise between model accuracy, performance and training time. The aforementioned architecture is the result of a study in which several specifications were analyzed, including the validation frequency, the loss function, the maximum epochs, the shuffle operation, initial learn rate and the validation patience. • The trained CNN is embedded on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform and tested in real time conditions with different fading channels. The FPGA prototype maintains close to perfect (theoretical) 5G+ channel estimation levels and outperforms the LS approach. Furthermore, a quantization study to evaluate the input data type impact on the CNNs performance in the FPGA was performed. The remaining of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the cascaded channel estimation approach using CNNs. In Section 3, the CNNs FPGA prototyping is explained. Results are shown in Section 4 and Section 5 is devoted to the conclusion. 2 CNN-based cascaded channel estimation In this section, the approach concerning the cascaded channel estimation using CNNs is presented, in which the cascaded channel basic concepts, the end-to-end communication system, the CNNs architecture, and the global project flow are described. 2.1 End-to-end communication system In this work, the 5G new radio (NR) communication system is considered, as defined by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). Table 1 summarizes the adopted 5G features, which comply with 3GPP TR 38.211 Release 15 specifications for 5G NR standard [21]. The resource grid (RG) includes the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), the physical downlink shared channel-demodulation reference signal (PDSCH-DMRS) and the physical downlink shared channel-phase tracking reference signal (PDSCH-PTRS). The end-to-end communication system implemented in this work is presented in Fig. 1 . It consists of a typical 5G transmitter, a cascaded channel with N links and a 5G receiver. In the receiver, the CNN-based channel estimation is compared with both the perfect (theoretical) and the practical (LS) estimation approaches with respect to the MSE and the BER at the end of the 5G NR link. The necessary data for the overall CNN training, validation and test flow corresponds to the RG obtained after the OFDM demodulation and the perfect estimation complex values. As observed in Fig. 1, the perfect timing and frequency synchronization is adopted so as not to interfere with the channel estimation results. In OFDM systems, which is the 5G NR case, timing and frequency offsets result in the rotation of the signal constellation, inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) [7], which can significantly deteriorate the system performance. Thus, as we aim to study the feasibility of the CNNs approach in the cascaded channel estimation, only the channel estimation processing function is analyzed considering the previous perfect synchronizations to prevent the propagation of errors. Likewise, FEC codes are not considered in the system model of this work due to the non-dependence of channel estimation with the related operation. FEC codes (i.e. low-density parity-check or turbo codes) operate at the edge of the channel, where the transmitted data bits are encoded so that the received erroneous data bits can be recovered at the receiver. This means that the channel estimation is transparent to the aforementioned correction process. Regarding the different approaches for the channel estimation, it should be mentioned that the perfect is obtained by the theoretical complex channel gains, being the reference values to the others. The practical channel estimation is provided by the interpolation of the channel response take into account the PDSCH-DMRS. Regarding the CNNs channel estimation, the received RG can be seen as a 2D image and thus, the channel estimation turns into an image processing problem. In fact, the CNNs are widely used in several computer vision tasks, such as image classification [22] and face recognition [23] for example. In Fig. 1, the 5G NR channel is characterized by the TDL, in which the fading model considered corresponds mainly to the Rayleigh and Rician, in some cases. In Table 2 , the TDL channel features adopted in this work are presented. The number of multipaths, maximum Doppler shift, delay and power paths are standardized by European telecommunications standards institute (ETSI). 2.1.1 Cascaded channel system As said in Section 1, cascaded channels have been considered in several physical multipath propagation scenarios. In this context, the block diagram of the TDL cascaded channels is presented in Fig. 2 . In the aforementioned figure, the general system model corresponds to a set of time-independent channels in cascaded configuration, between the transmitter and receiver, represented in Fig. 1 as a box named N Cascaded Channel. Fig. 2 represents this cascaded channel model adopted in this work, in each TDL channel is represented by t d l x and the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) by n, in which x represents the number of the channel instantiation. Note that each channel corresponds to one independent channel generation. 2.2 CNN architecture The present work was inspired by the results published in [16,18,19]. However, while in those studies CNNs are applied in one link channels, in this paper we extend the study to the far more challenging 5G (wireless) cascaded channel scenarios. Our model is a conventional CNN architecture (see Fig. 3 ), that consists of an input layer with the size of 612 × 14 , corresponding to the 5G features adopted in Table 1. The real and the imaginary part of each RG are subsequently input containing the interpolated PDSCH-DMRS symbols. Following the suggested CNN architecture in [16,18,19], three sets of convolutional and activation layers are used to extract and learn the representative characteristics (features) of the communication system. Finally, the output is a fully-connected regression layer, with the same dimension as the CNN input. Description of the CNN layers is listed below. • Input Layer: The interpolated PDSCH-DMRS is stored into a RG, and then separated into real and imaginary components. The CNN handles these components (real and imaginary) in a sequential mode (one after the other). Each 2D RG part is composed by 612 subcarriers per 14 symbols. • Convolutional (Conv) Layers: The 2D RG data goes through a sequence of convolutional layers, composed by several filters, in order to extract channel features with different levels of complexity. The CNN architecture, shown in Fig. 3, was optimized to have 3 convolutional layers and convolution filters with 9 × 9 and 5 × 5 dimensions. In order to keep the original RG dimension (i.e. 612 × 14), relevant paddings (Pad in Fig. 3) were added in the convolutional layers. • Activation Layer: Rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions are applied over the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers. • Output Regression Layer: Based on the features extracted from the hidden layers, the CNN outputs estimate the real and the imaginary part of the channel gain. Then, these parts are combined to get the complex channel gain. The network optimal parameters (weights and biases) are obtained iteratively by minimizing the Loss function, defined as the half non-normalized MSE ( MS E nn ) for regression tasks. The Loss function between the estimated channel ( y i ˆ ) and the actual channel ( y i ) is defined by (1) Loss = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( y ˆ i − y i ) 2 , where n indicates the size of the training set. For better scaling and visualization, the evolution of the root-MSE (RMSE) during the training iterations was also monitored, and is given by (2) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 n ( y ˆ i − y i ) 2 . In Fig. 4 , the RMSEs computed at each iteration with the training and the validation subsets respectively are presented. As can be seen the trajectories of both curves are close to each other which is an indication for the lack of overfitting issues. Similarly, regarding the Loss function, if the learning is successful, it is expected to converge to a constant and close to zero value, as it is shown in Fig. 4b. The CNN training is related with the choice of a number of hyper-parameters. For the present model, the hyper-parameters that have significantly impact on the RMSE are the maximum epochs, the validation frequency, the validation patience, the initial learn rate, the optimization method (i.e. the optimizer) and data randomization (i.e. shuffling). All of them are related with the learning (optimization) process. The maximum epochs specifies the maximum number of training epochs. The validation frequency corresponds to how often (in terms of number of iterations) the validation RMSE is calculated. The validation patience is the number of epochs that the algorithm tries to improve the performance before giving up (if the error is not decreasing). The initial learn rate is a trade-off between training time (low initial learn rate) and overfitting (high initial learn rate). Two widely used optimization methods were compared, namely Adam and RMSprop. Finally, training with (at each epoch) or without data shuffling were also studied. These parameters were optimized within a range of typical values, presented in Table 3 , to achieve a reasonable compromise between model accuracy, performance and training time. The optimal values for the hyper parameters, are summarized in the third column of Table 3. In Fig. 5 and Table 4 are presented the training and the validation RMSE, for the range of typical values of the hyper parameters. As optimal values were considered those that provided the lowest RMSE, or in alternative the minimum training time. Note that, as in Fig. 4, the training and the validation RMSEs for the chosen hyper parameters are close, which is again an indication for the lack of overfitting issues. 2.3 Training, validation and test flow The overall flow performed in this study is schematically presented in Fig. 6 . It consists of parameter configuration, training and validation steps, followed by model test and visualization of the results. Data was randomly generated and collected according to the 3GPP specifications with the system model shown in the Fig. 1, referred in Subsection 2.1. As said previously, the necessary data for the CNN training, validation and test flow corresponds to the RG obtained after the OFDM demodulation and the perfect estimation complex values. Thus, this data was randomly splitted into training (9600 RGs), validation (2400 RGs), and test (2400 RGs) sub-sets. The training and the validation steps are performed in-the-loop to control model overfitting problems. The simulation parameters were chosen such that each RG is subject to individual channel effects, covering a wide range of typical 5G channel effects. The final channel estimation quality was assessed by the MSE on test data (not used during the training and the validation steps). In addition, the overall channel performance, in terms of how well the transmitted bits are recovered, is evaluated by the test data BER. 3 CNN-based channel estimation on FPGA platform The FPGA devices are widely used in wireless processing functions due to their real-time performance and the advantage of being reconfigurable. As FPGAs are the major candidate for embedded devices in 5G networks, we tested the proposed channel estimation approach when the CNN-model is implemented on FPGA hardware. In our analysis, a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102 evaluation kit with a XCZU9EG-2FFVB1156 device is adopted in order to evaluate the trained CNNs. The overall flow considered in this work is shown in Fig. 7 , in which the necessary configurations are previously performed, with CNN architecture loading, the FPGA selection, and the bitstream that contains the hardware configuration file. In detail, an ethernet connection is established from the computer to the FPGA, to load a firmware image in a secure digital (SD) card. This contains the support package with the embedded software and the FPGA programming file containing a generic DL processor intellectual property (IP) core. After that, the FPGA boot from the SD card is executed. Next, the compilation and the CNN deployment is done. For each loaded input data quantity, the estimation is delivered and the results are visualized, along with the latency report. 4 Results and discussion In this section, we compare the BER and the MSE of the proposed CNN-based channel estimation with the perfect and the practical approaches for different SNR levels, number of links and modulation order. Perfect approach refers to the theoretical/ideal channel estimation and practical approach refers to the conventional LS method, a consolidated method for the channel estimation in cascaded channels [18]. The channel parameters are listed in Tables 1-2, and the CNN optimal hyper-parameters are listed in Table 3. The results here demonstrate the generalization properties of the CNN-based approach, because they are obtained with the test subset of the generated data, i.e. data not used to train or validate the CNN model. In Fig. 8 , BER and MSE curves are presented, for different number of cascaded channel links (N), with the modulation order, M, of the M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) scheme equal to 64 in 5G NR system. Initially, it should be mentioned that the BER measures presented in Fig. 8a are in accordance with [24], for the traditional techniques without FEC codes. In all cases (one, two, three or four TDL links) in Fig. 8 we observe that the CNN-based approach significantly reduces the MSE and outperforms the practical (LS) channel estimator. This is particularly notorious for low SNR levels (0-10 dB). For higher SNR (30-35 dB) both LS and CNN-based estimators tend to close MSE values. However, for the 4 links channel scenario (see Fig. 8d), even for high SNR levels the MSE of the practical estimator is much worse than the CNN-based counterpart. In terms of BER, while the CNN-based approach follows very closely the perfect estimator for the whole SNR range (0-35 dB), the practical approach worsen for higher SNR levels. Overall, the benefits of applying a deep learning approach are emphasized for increasing number of links. The negative effect of the increasing number (N) of links in the cascaded channels, namely noise, fading, distortion, are significantly diminished when estimated by a data-based approach that certainly encodes better the channel specific characteristics than the practical (LS) approach. In Fig. 9 , BER and MSE versus SNR are shown considering the modulation order M equal to 4, 16, 64 and 256 symbols and cascaded channel with N = 2 links. When M increases, the constellation symbols are closer and, consequently, they are more susceptible to the effects of the channel. This makes the receiver more likely to make mistakes in the decision process and therefore BER increases as seen in Fig. 9. However, the variation of M does not affect the channel estimation that much as the change of the channel links. Nevertheless, similar conclusions as in Fig. 8 can be drawn. The CNN-based channel estimator outperforms the practical approach in terms of smaller MSE for the lower SNR range (for all values of M) and closer to the theoretical BER than the BER obtained with the practical estimator. Simulated BER and MSE curves are shown in Fig. 10 as a function of the SNR, considering the channel estimation performed with the CNNs, perfect and practical approaches. In these simulations, nonidentical fading channels are adopted, since this is a more realistic scenario. The TDL channel features are described in Table 5 . In addition, it is considered M = 256 and N = 3. For comparison purposes, BER and MSE curves are also included in Fig. 10 taking into account the FPGA prototyping step. This study is performed in order to assess the CNN implementation feasibility for the 5G+ networks. In the FPGA experimental setup, there is a input data type quantization from 64 bits to 32 bits in floating point, resulting in a relative error mean between the two implementations in the order of 10 − 8 , concerning of MSE, with the BER unchanged, thus justifying the applicability and implementation of CNNs in FPGAs in several practical scenarios, which made this framework rather plausible. Thus, if an architecture with 32 bits in floating point is considered, it should be mentioned that the error obtained is basically due to the truncation of the number of bits. In our work, the impact of the number of input data bits in a more realistic implementation, that is, with a smaller number of bits combined with a fixed point architecture, is also analyzed in order to maximize the overall performance of the wireless network. For this input data type quantization study, a set of four fixed point configurations is also included in Fig. 10 in order to compare the BER and MSE values between them, namely: 32 bits with 27 fractional places, 24 bits with 19 fractional places, 16 bits with 11 fractional places, and 8 bits with 4 fractional places. The choice of the length regarding the integer and fractional bits results in a careful study in which the relative error between the implementations is minimized. From the results presented in Fig. 10, it is possible to verify that the BER and MSE curves concerning the CNNs implementation in software and in FPGA have an excellent match. The difference in the channel estimation in terms of the MSE metric, looking to the relative error mean (quantization error), is shown in Table 6 taking the 32 bits in floating point implementation as reference. The results obtained are directly affected by the bit length, in which the behavior of the quantization error follows the decrease in the number of bits. The impact of this quantization study on BER is also dependent on the number of bits, as shown in Table 6. However, the impact is smaller in the order of two decimal places than in the MSE metric. Regarding the FPGA implementation feasibility study, it is important to consider the input data type impact in the global performance system. For example, from the case with 32 bits (floating point) to the 8 bits (fixed point), the quantization error is 10 − 4 , which imposes a BER increasing in the order of the 10 − 2 . This means that the data input type quantization step has a considerable impact on the overall system and it is necessary to take it into account in the real system implementation. In terms of CNNs latency, Table 7 shows the obtained performance during the FPGA implementation step considering the clock frequency equal to 220 MHz. Note that the layers that introduce more latency are the convolutionals, since the activation ones corresponds only to a function executed in a clock cycle. This result proves the CNN implementation feasibility in the FPGA platform, relatively to the necessary processing time. 5 Conclusions In this paper, cascaded channel estimation in the fifth-generation and beyond (5G+) systems using convolution neural network (CNN), without forward error correction (FEC) codes, was proposed. In addition, the CNN prototyping was also performed, employing the field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. The results of the implementation of CNNs on FPGA hardware in several realistic scenarios, revealed this deep data-based framework as very promising. Furthermore, the impact of the number of bits combined with a fixed point architecture was also analyzed. The results of the quantization study have shown that the performance of the 5G and 5G+ wireless networks can be significantly enhanced by a CNN-based channel estimation embedded in FPGA hardware. In addition, the N estimators for each individual channel was turn into one operation with CNNs, thus avoiding the iterations of conventional estimators and reducing the receiver complexity. Several experimental and simulation results were obtained, concerning mean squared error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) under different number of links and modulation order. These results show that the CNN-based framework reaches very close to perfect (theoretical) channel estimation levels, in terms of BER values, and outperforms the LS practical estimation, measured in MSE. This indicates that the proposed CNN-based channel estimator has the potential to mitigate the negative effects of channels with several links and recover reliably the real and imaginary parts of the channel complex gains. In all studied scenarios, the CNN-based wireless cascaded channel estimator outperformed the conventional LS technique. These findings are particularly relevant for increasing number of links and increasing modulations orders. As future work, a system model with real synchronization processes will be considered, in which the symbol timing detection and carrier frequency offset algorithms are take into account in order to verify the impact on the CNN-based channel estimation processing function. It should be mentioned that this case is considered more appropriate and of practical interest to characterize more realistic 5G scenarios, since the timing and frequency offsets caused by absent of perfect synchronization result in the rotation of the signal constellation, imposed by the inter-symbol interference and inter-carrier interference, which can significantly deteriorate the system performance. Furthermore, an exhaustive study with different 5G new radio configurations can be performed. CRediT authorship contribution statement Fábio D. L. Coutinho and Hugerles S.

Recent research efforts have been dedicated to the development of computational tools to support medical doctors in the early diagnosis of AD. This paper is focused into studying the capacity of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to automatically identify AD based on PET neuroimaging. PET images of the cerebral metabolism of glucose with fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FGD) were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Two DL approaches are compared: a 2D Inception V3 pre-trained model and a custom end-to-end trained 3D CNN to take advantage of the spatial patterns of the full FDG-PET volumes. The results achieved demonstrate that the PET imaging modality is suitable indeed to detect early symptoms of AD. Further to that, the carefully tuned custom 3D CNN model brings computational advantages, while keeping the same discrimination capacity as the exhaustively pre-trained 2D Inception V3 model.",

In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline of a vision system to be integrated into floor-cleaning robots. This vision system was built upon the YOLOv5 framework, and its role is to detect dirty spots on the floor. The vision system is fed by two cameras: one on the front and the other on the back of the floor-cleaning robot. The goal of the front camera is to save energy and resources of the floor-cleaning robot, controlling its speed and how much water and detergent is spent according to the detected dirt. The goal of the back camera is to act as evaluation and aid the navigation node, since it helps the floor-cleaning robot to understand if the cleaning was effective and if it needs to go back later for a second sweep. A self-calibration algorithm was implemented on both cameras to stabilize image intensity and improve the robustness of the vision system. A YOLOv5 model was trained with carefully prepared training data. A new dataset was obtained in an automotive factory using the floor-cleaning robot. A hybrid training dataset was used, consisting on the Automation and Control Institute dataset (ACIN), the automotive factory dataset, and a synthetic dataset. Data augmentation was applied to increase the dataset and to balance the classes. Finally, our vision system attained a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.7 on the testing set.",

In this paper we propose an effective Log-based Intrusion Detection System (LIDS), to predict an attack or not, based on carefully selected features. The logs from various sources are aggregated into one dashboard and the most discriminative features are first determined.

Traditional techniques predict the intersection position and time using the information obtained during the free-flying ball motion. A common pain point in these systems is the short ball flight time and uncertainties in the ball’s trajectory estimation. In this paper, we present the Robot Anticipation Learning System (RALS) that accounts for the information obtained from observation of the thrower’s hand motion before the ball is released. RALS takes extra time for the robot to start moving in the direction of the target before the opponent finishes throwing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first robot control system for ball-catching with anticipation skills. Our results show that the information fused from both throwing and flying motions improves the ball-catching rate by up to 20% compared to the baseline approach, with the predictions relying only on the information acquired during the flight phase.",

Both the availability of bigger and better datasets as well as major advancements in Convolutional Neural Network methodologies represent some of the reasons behind these results. While the former is powered by initiatives like the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), the latter is potentiated by developments in CNN architectures and the rise of transfer learning. This paper addresses open research questions related to the effectiveness of transfer learning methods in the context of multi-class skin lesion classification. The results indicate that, depending on the way pre-trained models are re-purposed, recent CNN architectures can bring significant performance boosts on the overall performance of deep learning classifiers. Experiments also highlight the importance of a good dataset to train these models, and how class balancing through data augmentation can help ease this requirement. Furthermore, experimentation with different models shows that ensembles can bring an edge over single-model approaches. Finally, this work presents a competitive single- and multi-model approach to the ISIC 2019 challenge.",

However, for its practical exploitation in future deployments, FSO still requires the development of very highprecision and robust optical beam alignment. In this paper, we propose two different methods to achieve tight, precise alignment between a pair of FSO transceivers, using a gimbal-based setup. For scenarios where there is no information about the system, a black-box artificial intelligence (AI)-based method resorting to particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented, enabling to autonomously align the system with a success rate above 96%, converging from a blind starting position. Alternatively, for scenarios with partial information about the FSO system, we propose a tailored custom algorithm, with a success rate of 92%, but with a ∼4 × reduction on the alignment time. The automatic alignment is then validated in a 5G-like fiber-FSO scenario, transmitting a 16 × 400MHz signal and achieving a maximum bit-rate of 30 Gbps. Moreover, we propose the implementation of a fail-safe mechanism with a backup FSO receiver, thereby providing an extra degree of robustness towards temporary events of strong degradation on the FSO channel or line-of-sight (LOS) interruption.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2021 Author(s).Aquaculture is a fundamental sector of the food industry nowadays. However, to become a sustainable and more profitable industry, it is necessary to monitor several associated parameters, such as temperature, salinity, ammonia, potential of hydrogen, nitrogen dioxide, bromine, among others. Their regular and simultaneous monitoring is expected to predict and avoid catastrophes, such as abnormal fish mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection approach for the early prediction of high fish mortality based on a multivariate Gaussian probability model. The goal of this approach is to determine the correlation between the number of daily registered physicochemical parameters of the fish tank water and the fish mortality. The proposed machine learning model was fitted with data from the weaning and pre-fattening phases of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) collected over 2018, 2019, and 2020. This approach is suitable for real-time tracking and successful prediction of up to 80% of the high fish mortality rates. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed anomaly detection approach is the first time studied and applied in the framework of the aquaculture industry.",

Supervised learning with Convolutional Neural Networks has become the state of the art approach in many image related works. However, despite the great success of deep learning methods in other areas they remain relatively unexplored in the brain imaging field. In this paper we make an overview of recent achievements of Deep Learning to automatically extract features from brain signals that enable building Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI). Major challenge in the BMI research is to find common subject-independent neural signatures due to the high brain data variability across multiple subjects. To address this problem we propose a Deep Neural Autoencoder with sparsity constraint as a promising approach to extract hidden features from Electroencephalogram data (in-dept feature learning) and build a subject-independent noninvasive BMI in the affective neuro computing framework. Future direction for research are also outlined.",

Our particular choice of error term is intended to cause only gradual changes in the aircraft's direction so as to prevent unstable flight due to over-control.",

The implementation of network security operation systems is a new trend in the companies, to permanently monitor the logs and, in case of any anomalous traffic, to detect and hopefully prevent any security incident. These systems generate a huge amount of logs per second to be handled, leading to the need of automated ways to identify the cyber-attacks.In this paper we propose an effective Log-based Intrusion Detection System (LIDS), to predict an attack or not, based on carefully selected features. The logs from various sources are aggregated into one dashboard and the most discriminative features are first determined. For the attack prediction, a few machine learning techniques were comparatively tested, with the Decision tree being the winner. The proposed system is illustrated with the largest publicly available labelled log file dataset KDD Cup 1999.",

Finding a solution for this problem is a difficult task because phishers are very creative, and often it is hard even for a human to differentiate between legitimate and malign content. The goal of this project was to develop an intelligent tool for phishing detection that integrates only local information (the full content of the message) and does not rely on external (usually commercial) sources or black lists. The major focus of this paper is the selection of appropriate features to discriminate between ordinary and phishing messages and the choice of an efficient classifier. The system can dynamically update the feature list and quickly adapt to new trends of phishing attacks. The proposed tool is suitable for implementation in email accounts or any other social network or communication channel. It is intended to reduce the workload on human experts that otherwise need to go through hundreds of messages everyday to verify their authenticity.",

In this paper, a sparse Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to break text-based CAPTCHA is proposed. Unlike previous CNN solutions, which mainly use fine-tuning and transfer learning from pre-trained models, the proposed framework does not require a pre-trained model. The sparsity constraint deactivates connections between neurons in the CNN fully connected layers that leads to improved accuracy compared to the baseline approach. Visualization of the spatial distribution of neuron activity shed light on the internal learning and the effect of the sparsity constraint.",

Traditionally, the results of the matches are predicted using statistical models verified by domain experts. Nowadays, this approach is challenged by the increasing amount of diverse football related information that need to be processed. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning method to predict the football match outcome category (home win, draw, away win) based on prior to the game publicly available information. The proposed framework is illustrated with data for the Portuguese first division football teams for 2017/2018 season. Factor Analysis was applied to extract most discriminating features which allowed gradual convergence of the prediction error to 32.4% after accumulation of about one third of the season games. Our approach outperforms traditional models in the gambling industry today and implies potential financial opportunities. The proposed prediction model is useful for researchers, football betting crowd, bookmakers, sport managers.",

Yet, hand in hand with this growth goes the increasing difficulty to manage and organize all this new information. In fact, it becomes increasingly difficult to properly evaluate IoT and M2M context-aware platforms. Currently, these platforms use advanced machine learning algorithms to improve and optimize several processes. Having the ability to test them for a long time in a controlled environment is extremely important. In this paper, we discuss two distinct methods to generate a data stream from a small real-world dataset. The first model relies on first order Markov chains, while the second is based on GANs. Our preliminiar evalution shows that both achieve sufficient resolution for most real-world scenarios.",

We discuss the use of convolutional, recurrent neural nets, as well as deep belief networks, echo-state networks, reservoir computing, and denoising auto encoder models. A major challenge in modeling brain cognitive activity from EEG data is finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, as well as the inherent noise in the EEG recordings. The reviewed studies reveal the great potential of DL to decode human intentions in BCI applications and to find the invariant descriptors of human emotions across subjects in Affective Neurocomputing applications.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Mesenchymal Stromal cells (MSCs) have a potential role in cell-based therapies. Foetal bovine serum (FBS) is used to supplement the basal cell culture medium but presents several disadvantages and risks. Other alternatives have been studied, including human umbilical cord blood plasma (hUCBP), aiming at the development of xeno-free culturing protocols. A comparative characterization of multicomponent metabolic composition of hUCBP and commercial FBS based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis was performed. The analysis of 1H-NMR spectra revealed both similarities and differences between the two proposed supplements. Similar metabolites (amino acids, glucose, lipids and nucleotides) were found in the hUCBP and FBS NMR spectra. The results show that the major difference between the metabolic profiles of the two proposed supplements are due to the significantly higher levels of glucose and lower levels of lactate, glutamate, alanine and branched chain amino acids in hUCBP. Similar or slightly different levels of important proteinogenic amino acids, as well as of nucleotides, lipids were found in the hUCBP and FBS. In order to validate it's suitability for cell culture, umbilical cord-MSCs (UC-MSCs) and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were expanded using hUCBP. In both hMSCs, in vitro culture with hUCBP supplementation presented similar to improved metabolic performances when compared to FBS. The two cell types tested expressed different optimum hUCBP percentage content. For DPSCs, the optimum hUCBP content was 6% and for UC-MSCs, 4%. Cultured hMSCs displayed no changes in senescence indicators, as well as maintained characteristic surface marker's expression. FBS substitution was associated with an increase in early apoptosis events, in a dose dependent manner, as well as to slight up- and down-regulation of targeted gene's expression. Tri-lineage differentiation capacity was also influenced by the substitution of FBS by hUCBP.",

This paper studies the role of early anticipation skills to improve the performance of a robotic system playing ball catching with a human partner. The source of anticipatory information results from the observation of the thrower's motion before the ball is released. For that purpose, a feed-forward neural network is trained to estimate the initial position and velocity of the ball in-flight given a sequence of observations during the throwing phase. The proposed approach outperforms up to 20% the classical methodology in which the generation of predictions solely relies upon the available information during the flight phase. Several simulation results demonstrate the added value of early anticipation skills from the viewpoint of ball catching performance.",

Most of the previous studies are focused in building an individual discrimination model for every subject (subject dependent model). Building subject-independent models is a harder problem due to the high data variability between different subjects and different experiments with the same subject. This paper explores, for the first time, the Factor Analysis as an efficient technique to extract temporal and spatial EEG features suitable to build brain-computer interface for decoding human emotions across various subjects. Our findings show that early waves (temporal window of 200-400 ms after the stimulus onset) carry more information about the valence of the emotion. Also, spatial location of features, with a stronger impact on the emotional valence, occurs in the parietal and occipital regions of the brain. All discrimination models (NN, SVM, kNN, and RF) demonstrate better discrimination rate of the positive valence. These results match closely experimental psychology hypothesis that, during early periods after the stimulus presentation, the brain response - to images with highly positive valence - is stronger.",

For each subject, an individual HMM is trained with features, extracted from the orthogonal decomposition (SVD) of the subject's training images. The main advantage of the proposed SVD-HMM recognition system is the robustness against image dimensionality reduction. The system was tested on two benchmark face datasets - the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) and the YALE database. The SVD-HMM was further compared with a standard SVD face recognition. SVD applied to the original (full size) images performs similarly to the SVD-HMM applied to the compressed (half of the original size) images. SVD degrades rapidly when the image is compressed.",

The method is validated with EEG data to identify the common neural signatures based on which the positive and negative valence of human emotions across multiple subjects can be reliably discriminated. The key step in the proposed approach is the Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) adaptation of the reservoir states. Learning Echo State Networks (ESN) with IP maximizes the entropy of the distribution of reservoir vectors given static data as a fixed input, which is supposed to follow Gaussian distribution. The equilibrium reservoir vector is extracted for each static input vector by iterating updates of the reservoir vector until it converges. Standard classification and clustering models provided with selected combinations of reservoir neurons are ranked based on their discriminate performance. The IP tuned ESNs is more powerful technique to map the high dimensional input feature vector into a low dimensional representation and improve the emotion valence discrimination compared to classical ESNs and Deep Neural Encoders.",

In this paper we propose a new approach for feature dimensionality reduction based on Reservoir Computing (Echo State Networks). The method is validated with EEG data to identify the common neural signatures based on which the positive and negative valence of human emotions across multiple subjects can be reliably discriminated. The key step in the proposed approach is the Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) adaptation of the reservoir states. Learning Echo State Networks (ESN) with IP maximizes the entropy of the distribution of reservoir vectors given static data as a fixed input, which is supposed to follow Gaussian distribution. The equilibrium reservoir vector is extracted for each static input vector by iterating updates of the reservoir vector until it converges. Standard classification and clustering models provided with selected combinations of reservoir neurons are ranked based on their discriminate performance. The IP tuned ESNs is more powerful technique to map the high dimensional input feature vector into a low dimensional representation and improve the emotion valence discrimination compared to classical ESNs and Deep Neural Encoders. Keywords Reservoir Computing Echo State Networks Intrinsic Plasticity Deep Neural Encoders Feature dimensionality reduction Affective computing 1 Introduction Affective Computing (AC) is a research field that aims to automatically detect and quantify human emotions. Major techniques for affect detection are voice or facial expressions, text, body posture or language [1, 2]. Affective Neuroscience emerged recently as a new AC approach that attempts to find the neural correlated between human emotions and registered brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most exploited brain imaging techniques due to its accessibility in several research labs and clinical environments. Comprehensive review of EEG-based emotion recognition systems is provided in [3]. It is difficult to compare the results, because of factors such as data acquisition scenarios, number of participants, emotion models, type of stimulus and extracted features, temporal windows, etc. However, most of the solutions build a recognition model for each participant (subject dependent model) [4–7]. Building models that cover multiple subjects (i.e. subject independent models) is a challenging problem due to the intrinsic variability of the registered brain activity among different participants [8]. For example in [3] based on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) in different frequency bands of the EEG signal and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, happy/unhappy emotions are discriminated with accuracy of 75.62% for the subject dependent setting and only 62.12% for the generalized subject independent setting. In [9], emotion clustering with 84% inter-subjects accuracy is presented based on similarities between phase portraits constructed from the time-response of a Duffing oscillator. The results are obtained with simulated data with low signal to noise ratio (<10dB). In [10] exhaustive feature reduction improves the inter-subject accuracy up to 80%. More challenging problem of four emotions (pleasure, joy, sadness, anger) is considered in [11] with 82% inter-subject accuracy. The emotion recognition systems across multiple subjects have to come up with the problem of choosing the most relevant features for all participants and the usually high dimensional feature space. Working on this problem in [12] we proposed the Echo State Network (ESN) as a mechanism for low dimensional feature space projection in the EEG-based affective computing. The ESNs are dynamical structures designed to facilitate learning in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), normally applied for time series modeling. Using ESNs for static data classification or clustering gained less attention. In [13] we proposed a novel approach to extract the equilibrium reservoir states that maximize the model discrimination capacity after Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) adaptation of the reservoir states. Based on IP-trained ESN and after search for the optimal combination of equilibrium reservoir states we obtained subject independent classification models of human emotion valence that outperformed the above referenced studies. The experience gained suggested that a reliable inter-subject neural decoding is feasible only if the features are carefully reduced to the most discriminative ones. The goal of the present work is twofold. First, we explore the limits of the ESNs low dimensional representations and define the optimal reservoir states combination that can serve as the most discriminative features particularly in inter-subject affective computing setting. Secondly, we make a broad comparison between the IP-trained ESNs with classical ESNs (with randomly generated reservoir) and the state of the art Deep Neural Autoencoders (DNA). DNAs are based on the concept of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [14] where the subsequent hidden layers, called auto-encoders, map the input data into representation features with different level of abstraction. We argue that the extraction of optimal low dimensional combinations of IP-trained reservoir equilibrium states is more promising mechanism than the auto-encoders for data representation and feature dimensionality reduction in the framework of the EEG-based affective computing. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the IP-adaptation in Reservoir Computing (RC) is outlined and our approach for RC-based feature extraction is presented. In Section 3 the experimental scenario and the EEG data acquisition are described. In Section 4 a clustering approach for the ESN-based emotion valence discrimination from EEG signals is proposed, and in Section 5 the same problem is solved as a classification task. IP-tuned ESN is compared with Deep Neural Encoders in Section 6. Discussion of the results and conclusions are summarized in Section 7. 2 Reservoir adaptation with Intrinsic Plasticity 2.1 Reservoir Computing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) represent a large class of computational models particularly suitable for nonlinear time series processing. However, despite their successful application in academic and practical problems, the RNN training is only feasible for relatively small networks. A promising approach to overcome the RNN shortcomings was proposed independently by Wolfgang Maass under the name Liquid State Machines [15] and by Herbert Yaeger under the name of Echo State Networks [16]. This approach is often referred to as Reservoir Computing (RC), [17]. In this work the Echo State Network (ESN) formalism of RC is used. The basic structure of the ESN, presented on Fig. 1, consists of one hidden layer, called dynamic reservoir, of randomly connected sigmoid neurons, usually tanh nonlinear functions f res (1) r ( k ) = f r e s ( W i n i n ( k ) + W r e s r ( k − 1 ) ) and a linear function f out at the output (readout): (2) o u t ( k ) = f o u t ( W o u t [ i n ( k ) r ( k ) ] ) Here k denotes discrete time instant, in(k) is the vector of ESN inputs with dimension n in , r(k) is the vector of reservoir neurons states with dimension n r and out(k) is the vector of ESN outputs with dimension n out . W in and W res are randomly generated matrices of the input and the reservoir weights that remain unchanged during network training. Only the output weights (matrix W out ) are trained. In some applications direct input-output connection is not supposed. In contrast to the classical RNN where the reservoir and the readout weights are trained in the same way, the ESN treats them differently. The purpose of the reservoir is to expand the input history into a rich enough reservoir state space r(k) while the readout combines the neuron signals r(k) into the desired output signal out target (k). The weights of the reservoir neurons are randomly generated from a uniform distribution symmetric around zero. An important ESN property is that the reservoir should possess the so called echo state property. This means that the effect of the current state r(k) and the current input in(k) on a future state r(k+n) should decrease as time passes ( n → ∞ ). There have been various attempts to define rules that guarantee the echo state property and optimize the reservoir. Many of them are based on experience, heuristics or exhaustive search over the parameter space. A promising biologically motivated mechanism called intrinsic plasticity (IP) has recently attracted a wide attention in the reservoir computing community [18]. 2.2 Intrinsic Plasticity The IP adaptation rule aims at maximization of information transmission trough the ESN that is equivalent to its output entropy maximization. Motivation of this approach is related to known biological mechanisms that change neural excitability according to the distribution of the input stimuli. In [19] a gradient method for adjusting the biases is proposed and an additional gain term to achieve the desired distribution of outputs by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence: (3) D K L ( p ( r ) , p d ( r ) ) = ∫ p ( r ) log ( p ( r ) p d ( r ) ) d r D KL measures the difference between the actual p(r) and the desired p d (r) probability distribution of the reservoir states r. In [18] the IP formalism for hyperbolic tangent neuron transfer functions and Gaussian output distribution is derived (4) p d ( r ) = 1 σ 2 π exp ( − ( r − μ ) 2 2 σ 2 ) Now, the expression (3) can be rearranged as follows: (5) D K L ( p ( r ) , p d ( r ) ) = − H ( r ) + 1 2 σ 2 E ( ( r − μ ) 2 ) + log 1 σ 2 π , where H denotes entropy. The last term in (5) is constant and the second term determines the deviation of the reservoir state r from the desired mean value. The minimization of (5) is a compromise between the entropy maximization and the minimization of the distance between μ and r. In order to achieve this effect two additional reservoir parameters – the gain a and the bias b (both vectors with size n r ) - are introduced as follows: (6) r ( k ) = f r e s ( d i a g ( a ) W i n i n ( k ) + d i a g ( a ) W r e s r ( k − 1 ) + b ) The IP adaptation adjusts a and b using iterative gradient descent: a i t = a i t − 1 + Δ a b i t = b i t − 1 + Δ b where it denotes iteration number and the gradients Δ a and Δ b are derivatives of Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to vectors a and b. In the case of hyperbolic tangent reservoir neurons ( f res =tanh) the gradients are: Δ b = − η ( − μ σ 2 + r σ 2 ( 2 σ 2 + 1 − r 2 + μ r ) ) Δ a = η a + Δ b n e t i n p u t n e t i n p u t = W i n i n + W r e s r Here η is the learning rate. The IP adaptation tends to concentrate the reservoir outputs according to the parameters of the targeted Gaussian distribution p d (r). The equilibrium state of the reservoir r e for a constant input in c can be determined as: (7) r e = tanh ( d i a g ( a ) W i n i n c + d i a g ( a ) W r e s r e + b ) In case b=0 and in c =0, the equilibrium will be at the origin of the reservoir state space coordinate system. Otherwise it will be moved depending on the values of input in c and bias b vectors. Since the input weight matrix remains constant, the first term in the brackets will be also constant for a constant inputs in c . Thus we can consider it together with the bias term as a common bias for a given input vector: (8) r e = tanh ( d i a g ( a ) W r e s r e + b i n c ) , b i n c = d i a g ( a ) W i n i n c + b The reservoir equilibrium states vary randomly within the hyperbolic tangent interval [−1+1]. After the IP adaptation rule they will be squeezed into the interval determined by the variance σ . The convergence of the reservoir states to the expected distributions is proven in [18]. Typical values for the key parameters of the algorithm suggested in [18] are: zero mean, variance=0.1, learning rate η=0.0005, a=1 and b=0 as initial values. The IP training stops when no significant changes of the equilibrium states are observed. In [20] we have shown that in fact IP adaptation rule achieves balance between maximization of entropy at the ESN reservoir output and its concentration around the pre-specified mean value increasing at the same time reservoir stability. 2.3 ESN reservoir for extraction of low dimensional features In [21] we have observed that the reservoir equilibrium states are concentrated in several regions and they depend on the input vectors. If the input vectors are close in the input space, they will result in close equilibrium points in the reservoir state. Let consider the following experiment: Well separated data clusters were generated in 3D unit cube space (see Fig. 2) and the data was input into an ESN reservoir. In Fig. 3 are depicted some of the 2D combinations of reservoir neuron outputs scaled within interval [−1, +1] before and after the IP-training. It is easy to see that the representation of the input data into 2D reservoir projections before the IP training does not reflect well the cluster separation compared to the reservoir state distribution after the IP training. Note also that not all 2D neurons output combinations are equally successful in detecting the clusters. Each couple of neurons can be considered as different “point of view projection” of multidimensional input space into the two dimensional neurons equilibriums. Thus, the question is how to find the best projections that represent the data structure? The IP training forces the reservoir outputs to pre-specified Gaussian distributions. See for example in Fig. 4 (top), the probability density distributions of equilibrium states of ten neurons from the initial ESN reservoir and achieved after IP tuning new distributions of neurons equilibriums at Fig. 4 (bottom). As seen, the neuron output distribution is a combination of several Gaussian distributions. Red triangles on the figure mark the maxima of the local Gaussian distribution curves. Neurons 1 and 7 have the highest number of local maxima and the finest data separation as seen in Fig. 4 (bottom). This observation formulated the idea of using the ESN reservoir for extraction of low dimensional features. The main steps of the algorithm we proposed in [13] to extract the equilibrium reservoir states that maximize the discrimination capacity after IP training are summarized below. Step 1: Define the ESN structure and generate the initial ESN state. The ESN input dimension is equal to the number of the original features. Choose the number of reservoir neurons and generate random neuron weights. Substitute the ESN readout by a clustering or classification technique. Step 2: Iterative IP adaptation of the ESN reservoir states according to Eqs.(4–8) until equilibrium states r e , are reached. Step 3: Generate low dimensional projections of the equilibrium states (combinations of reservoir neurons) - an iterative procedure with the following sub-steps: a) Create all possible 2D combinations of the equilibrium states of the reservoir neurons, obtained after IP training. Use these 2D combinations as inputs for classification/clustering models; rank the models based on some performance measure (for example in this work we use the accuracy on test data). b) Select C best ranked models. Use their corresponding 2D feature vectors to generate 3D combinations adding one by one the rest of reservoir neurons equilibrium states. Use these 3D combinations as inputs for classification/clustering models and rank them. c) Select again C best ranked combinations and as in the previous step use them to create 4D feature vectors; fit and rank classification/clustering models. d) Repeat Step 3 generating higher dimensional feature vectors until no significant improvement in the discrimination accuracy is observed. Step 3 is computationally the most expensive step. The number of all combinations of neurons is (n r -! /(n r —k+1)! * k), where n r is the reservoir size, k is the number of neurons in the combination. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the projections after step 3a (higher than 2D projections) are constructed from a subset of C best ranked 2D projections (for step 3b), C best ranked 3D projections (for step 3c), etc. In the experiments, in Sections 4 and 5, C is set up to 20. 3 EEG data acquisition and initial feature set extraction The human emotion granularity can be schematically represented in two dimensions: i) valence, varying from negative to positive, and ii) arousal (emotion intensity), varying from low to high. The combination of these affective dimensions forms four emotional categories, which incorporate several discrete human emotions, such as joy, pleasure, excitement, melancholy, anger, fear, disgust, etc. Thus, any emotion-related bio-signal can be differentiated according to its valence or arousal dimension [22]. We aim to discriminate the positive and negative emotion valence, based on EEG data generated in response to external stimuli, aka Event Related Potentials (ERP). The ERPs were recorded while 26 female volunteers were viewing pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) repository. A total of 24 high arousal (IAPS rating>6) images with positive (M=7.29+/−0.65) and negative (M=1.47+/−0.24) valence were selected. For each image, signals from 21 EEG channels were sampled at 1kHz and stored. The raw EEG signals were first filtered (between 0.1 and 30Hz.), eye-movement corrected, baseline compensated and segmented into epochs using NeuroScan software. The ensemble average for each condition (positive/negative valence) was also computed and filtered with passband [0.5–15] Hz. See [13] for more details on data description. Twelve temporal features were stored corresponding to the amplitudes of the first three local minimums (Amin1, Amin2, Amin3), the first three local maximums (Amax1, Amax2, Amax3), and their associated latencies (Lmin1, Lmin2, Lmin3, Lmax1, Lmax2, Lmax3). Recent studies report evidence that the above temporal features correlate well with stimulus loaded with intensive emotions [23]. Thus, the initial feature set is a matrix X with dimension of 252 columns (21 channels x12 features) and 52 lines (the ensemble averaged positive and negative labeled trials of 26 subjects). In the experiments the normalized feature matrix was used, i.e. (X-mean(X))/std(X). 4 Clustering with ESN –experimental results 4.1 Low dimensional combinations of equilibrium states In this section the algorithm described in Section 2.3 is implemented to discriminate the positive and negative emotion valence across multiple subjects. The ESN input is provided with the normalized original features (252) described in Section 3. The ESN reservoir dimension varies between 10 and 500 neurons. The readout of the IP-adapted ESN is substituted by k-means ( Fig. 5) and fuzzy C-means (FCM, Fig. 6) clustering algorithms. The clustering algorithms are provided with the following features: i) All equilibrium states of the reservoir (ESN all). ESN with 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 300 and 500 neurons are tested. ii) 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D and 7D combinations of equilibrium states. On Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are presented only the results with those combinations that maximize the clustering accuracy; iii) Direct clustering. In this case the ESN is switched of and the clustering algorithms are provided with the original normalized feature matrix (252 features). The numerical values related with Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The IP procedure converges after 5–10 iterations. Note that while the 2D combinations of equilibrium states (step 3a of the algorithm described in Section 2.3) range over all reservoir neurons, the subsequent nD combinations (steps 3b, 3c, 3d) are obtained from the best C=20 combinations of reservoir states kept at the previous step. Clustering based on the best low dimensional nD (n=2,3,4,5,6,7) combinations of equilibrium states clearly outperforms clustering using all reservoir equilibrium states (ESN all) or direct clustering of the original feature matrix. For large range of the reservoir dimension (10−500), direct clustering and ESN all scenarios do not provide better discrimination than a random chance. Higher the reservoir size lower the accuracy for the ESN all scenario In contrast, nD (n=2,3,4,5,6,7) features extracted particularly from reservoirs with high number of neurons (150, 300 500) achieve significantly higher performance with close to 80% accuracy (for 2D projections) to more than 90% accuracy (for 6D and 7D projections). This is a very promising result in the context of such challenging by its nature inter-subject clustering task. As it can be expected above a certain limit for n (n=7 in this case) there is no further improvement in the clustering performance. 4.2 IP-adapted ESN versus classical ESN with randomly generated reservoir states The benefits of using IP adaptation rule are demonstrated with this experiment. On Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 are depicted the discrimination accuracy of k-means and FCM clustering for varying ESN reservoir size (from 10 to 500 neurons) provided with the following features: i) All randomly generated reservoir states (ESN_ini_all) versus all equilibrium states after IP training ((ESN_ip_all); ii) 2D combinations of reservoir states without IP training (ESN_ini_2D) and after IP training ((ESN_ip_2D). iii) Direct clustering with the initial feature matrix (the same scenario as in 4.1.iii) The results show that we always get an improvement in performance after IP-adaptation of the reservoir. We also see that the effect of IP training is more expressive when 2D combinations of reservoir states with and without IP training are compared. The numerical values related with Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 are given in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. 5 Classification with ESN –experimental results 5.1 Low dimensional combinations of equilibrium states Now we consider the same problem as in Section 4 formulated as a classification task. The ESN reservoir dimension varies again between 10 and 500 neurons. The readout of the IP-adapted ESN is substituted by a classification algorithm. The following standard classifiers are compared: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees (DT). The classifiers are provided with the following features: i) All equilibrium states of reservoirs with 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 300 and 500 neurons ( Fig. 9). ii) 2D ( Fig. 10), 3D ( Fig. 11), 4D ( Fig. 12), 5D ( Fig. 13) and 6D ( Fig. 14) combinations of equilibrium states. On the figures are presented only the results with those combinations that maximize the classification accuracy of each classifier. The numerical values related with the figures are given in Tables 5–8, respectively. Similarly to the clustering approach, the nD combinations (for n>2) are obtained from the best ranked twenty combinations of reservoir states kept at the previous step, as a way to control the computational complexity. At each training iteration, data belonging to one subject (26 subjects in total) is left aside and used for model testing (leave-one-subject-out cross validation). Thus, 26-fold cross validation is performed and only testing results are presented on the figures. The results show that increasing the reservoir dimension improves the classification accuracy up to a certain threshold of nD projections (n=6, Fig. 14). This tendency is related with the increasing number of equilibrium state combinations and therefore higher search resolution for discovering the best discriminative feature vectors. Above 6D combinations there was no further improvement in the correct classification. The very high testing accuracy (above 95%) achieved by most of the classifiers for 5D and 6D combinations outperform all previously published results in affective computing based on brain neural data. Similar to the clustering process, classification based on the best low dimensional nD (n=2,3,4,5,6) combinations of equilibrium states is superior compared to classification using all reservoir equilibrium states (Fig. 9). Classification with all equilibrium states as features is not much affected by the reservoir dimension variation (Fig. 9). However the classifiers may diverge significantly in performance which is overall low (between 45% and 75%). Finally, it is observed that solving the problem as a classification task is more plausible than the clustering approach. 6 Deep Neural Autoencoder model of emotion valence discrimination Neural networks with multiple hidden layers are useful for solving classification problems with complex nonlinear data. Each layer can learn features at a different level of abstraction. However, similar to the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), training neural networks with multiple hidden layers by back-propagation algorithm is difficult in practice. The learning time does not scale well, it is very slow in networks with multiple hidden layers, it can get stuck in poor local optima. Deep Neural Autoencoders (DNA) attempt to overcome these problems, following a similar concept to the IP-adapted ESN. The DNA hidden layers are first pre-trained individually in an unsupervised fashion using auto-encoders [14]. Both ESN and DNA map the data into a representative feature space and make the training feasible. In this section we build DNA models of emotion valence discrimination and compare them with the reservoir computing solution. The following procedure for DNA training is implemented: a) Training the first hidden layer (called auto-encoder) on the training data without using the labels. An auto-encoder is a neural network which attempts to replicate its input at its output. Thus, the size of its input will be the same as the size of its output. The auto-encoder is comprised of an encoder followed by a decoder. The encoder maps an input to a hidden representation and the decoder attempts to reverse this mapping to reconstruct the original input; b) The next hidden layers (autoencoders) are trained in a similar way. The main difference is that the features that are generated from the previous autoencoder are the training data for the next autoencoder. The size of each subsequent encoder is decreased, so that it learns a smaller representation of the input data. c) Unlike the autoencoders, the final (output) layer is trained in a supervised fashion using labels for the training data. We have used softmax function as a processing unit in this layer. d) Final retraining of the whole multilayer network is performed on the training data in a supervised fashion applying standard backpropagation. This step is referred as fine DNA tuning. We built DNA classification models with one, two and three auto-encoders ( Fig. 15). The size of the DNA input vector corresponds to the number of the original features (252). The size of the first encoder varies between 10 and 500 neurons. The results for single autoencoder DNAs with 10, 30, 50, 100,150, 300 and 500 neurons are visualized on Fig. 16. When the size of the encoder is less than the size of the input (i.e. encoders with 10, 30, 50, 100 and 150 neurons), the auto-encoder learns a compressed representation of the input. In the opposite case (i.e. encoders with 300 and 500 neurons) the auto-encoder projects the input data into a higher dimensional representation, similar to kernel-based data transformation. The results in Fig. 16 do not show benefits of expanding the input data compared to the compressed data representation. For DNAs with two and three auto-encoders we applied the rule for size reduction of each subsequent encoder. Thus, for example if the second encoder is L2=5, we build two layers DNNs (see Fig. 17) with varying first encoder L1={10,30,50, 100,150, 300) and if L2=150 then there is only one option for L1=300. Similarly, for three layers DNA (see Fig. 18), if the third encoder is L3=5, we built six DNAs with the following L1-L2 dimensions (50-15, 150-20, 300-50, 300-150, 500-100, 500-300) and if L3=150, again there is only one option for L1-L2=500-300. Following the decreasing layer size rule in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 are depicted the testing classification accuracies for a number of DNA with 2 hidden layers (L1-L2) and DNA with three hidden layers (L1-L2-L3) with varying layer size. The best accuracy with test data (81%) was obtained both for two layers (300-50) and three layers (500-300-50) DNA. The DNA auto-encoder training and the subsequent hidden layer extraction with decreasing size is similar of the low dimensional projections (nD, n=1,2,3,…) of the ESN model. The results show however, that the IP-pretraining is more suitable mechanism than the DNA for data representation and feature dimensionality reduction in the framework of the EEG-based affective computing. For example the IP-trained ESN with maximum of 6D reservoir feature space extracted from 300 or 500 reservoir equilibrium neurons achieved around 90% clustering accuracy (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and above 95% classification accuracy (Fig. 14) compared to the 81% of the most successful DNA models (Fig. 17, Fig. 18). 7 Conclusions We have shown that using reservoir computing pre-training is beneficial for selecting the most relevant discriminative features and reaching state-of-the-art performance for subject independent emotion valence recognition. This study confirmed the observation that the reservoir computing approach can be used not only for time series processing but also for high dimensional static data representation. We also presented experimental evidence that IP-trained ESN can boost performance compared to classical (without pre-training) ESN both in solving clustering and classification tasks. Finally we have demonstrated that IP-trained ESNs outperform pre-trained deep neural auto-encoders and can actually achieve above 95% testing accuracy. The cost for this significant improvement is the computational time required to test all feature vector combinations and extract the most discriminative ones. This problem is particularly relevant for big reservoirs. For example for a reservoir with 500 neurons, 124750 combinations of 2D equilibrium states need to be analyzed. Therefore, we proposed to tackle this problem by ranking the neuron combinations at each iteration and choosing only the best C combinations for the next iteration. The results in this paper can potentially contribute to the ongoing debate on data representation and training algorithms, especially whether DNN are more suited for large-scale machine learning problems. Therefore, applying the algorithm presented in Section 2 on ESNs in different context seems an attractive line of future research in order to obtain a solid comparison.

        "doc_abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.We consider the dynamic EEG source localization problem with additional constraints on the expected value of the state. In dynamic EEG source localization, the brain sources, also called dipoles, are not stationary but vary over time. Moreover, given our specific EEG experiment, we expect the dipoles to be located within a certain area of the brain (here, the visual cortex). We formulate this constrained dynamic source localization problem as a constrained non-linear state-estimation problem. Particle filters (PFs) are nowadays the state-of-the-art in optimal non-linear and non-Gaussian state estimation. However, PFs cannot handle additional constraints on the state that cannot be incorporated within the system model. In this case, the additional constraint is on the mean of the state, which means that realizations of the state, also called particles within the PF framework, may or may not satisfy the constraint. However, the state must satisfy the constraint on average. This is indeed the case when tracking brain dipoles from EEG experiments that try to target a specific cortex of the brain. Such constraints on the mean of the state are hard to deal with because they reflect global constraints on the posterior density of the state. The popular solution of constraining every particle in the PF may lead either to a stronger condition or to a different (unrelated) condition; both of which result in incorrect estimation of the state. We propose the Iterative Mean Density Truncation (IMeDeT) algorithm, which inductively samples particles that are guaranteed to satisfy the constraint on the mean. Application of IMeDeT on synthetic and real EEG data shows that incorporating a priori constraints on the state improves the tracking accuracy as well as the convergence rate of the tracker.",

These could greatly benefit from the development of a real-time alerting system that will call subjects back to task even before lapses occur or shortly after they happened. Attention levels have been shown to relate to the properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this paper, we propose for the first time a regression approach to detect fluctuating levels of attention, based on spatiotemporal patterns extracted from EEG recordings. Previous studies have shown that reaction time is related to the level of task related attention. Moment-to-moment fluctuations in attention level are paralleled by moment-tomoment fluctuations in reaction time (faster reaction times are related to high attention allocation). We took advantage of this parallel and used reaction time data obtained during a repetitive visuomotor task as a proxy for task related attention level. Furthermore, instead of defining high attention versus low attention periods, we labeled each moment according to a continuum based on each trial's reaction time. In order to determine if it is possible to predict attention level from EEG features, we developed regression models between the extracted features and the subject's reaction time.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.The aim of this paper is to identify the common neural signatures based on which the positive and negative valence of human emotions across multiple subjects can be reliably discriminated. The brain activity is observed via Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are transient components in the Electroencephalography (EEG) generated in response to a stimulus. ERPs were collected while subjects were viewing images with positive or negative emotional content. Building inter-subject discrimination models is a challenging problem due to the high ERPs variability between individuals. We propose to solve this problem with the aid of the Echo State Networks (ESN) as a general framework for extracting the most relevant discriminative features between multiple subjects. The original feature vector is mapped into the reservoir feature space defined by the number of the reservoir equilibrium states. The dominant features are extracted iteratively from low dimensional combinations of reservoir states. The relevance of the new feature space was validated by experiments with standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. From one side this proof of concept application enhances the usability context of the reservoir computing for high dimensional static data representations by low-dimensional feature transformation as functions of the reservoir states. From other side, the proposed solution for emotion valence detection across subjects is suitable for brain studies as a complement to statistical methods.

The aim of this paper is to identify the common neural signatures based on which the positive and negative valence of human emotions across multiple subjects can be reliably discriminated. The brain activity is observed via Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are transient components in the Electroencephalography (EEG) generated in response to a stimulus. ERPs were collected while subjects were viewing images with positive or negative emotional content. Building inter-subject discrimination models is a challenging problem due to the high ERPs variability between individuals. We propose to solve this problem with the aid of the Echo State Networks (ESN) as a general framework for extracting the most relevant discriminative features between multiple subjects. The original feature vector is mapped into the reservoir feature space defined by the number of the reservoir equilibrium states. The dominant features are extracted iteratively from low dimensional combinations of reservoir states. The relevance of the new feature space was validated by experiments with standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. From one side this proof of concept application enhances the usability context of the reservoir computing for high dimensional static data representations by low-dimensional feature transformation as functions of the reservoir states. From other side, the proposed solution for emotion valence detection across subjects is suitable for brain studies as a complement to statistical methods. This problem is important because such decision making systems constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and clinical applications. Keywords Echo State Networks Reservoir computing Feature selection Affective computing Event Related Potentials 1 Introduction Affective neuroscience (AN) is a new modality in the interdisciplinary research field of affective computing that attempts to discover the neural correlates between human emotions and the registered brain activity, Calvo and D’Mello (2010) and Dalgleish, Dunn, and Mobbs (2009). The Electroencephalography (EEG)-based AN has attracted more attention because it is a noninvasive, cheap and relatively easy to apply technology (AlZoubi, Calvo, & Stevens, 2009; Olofsson, Nordin, Sequeira, & Polich, 2008; Petrantonakis & Hadjileontiadis, 2010). Most of the emotion recognition systems build an individual model for every subject (intra-subject models) (Chanel, Kronegg, Grandjean, & Pun, 2006; Frantzidis et al., 2010; Li & Lu, 2009; Liu, Sourina, & Nguyen, 2010; Nie, Wang, Shi, & LuS, 2011). Building inter-subject models is a harder problem due to the high neural variability between individuals. For example in Jatupaiboon, Panngum, and Israsena (2013) a real-time classification of happy/unhappy emotions elicited by pictures and classical music is proposed. The combination of features extracted from the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the EEG signal and the Support Vector machine (SVM) classifier resulted into 75.62% classification accuracy for the intra-subject models and significantly lower (62.12%) accuracy for the inter-subject generalization. Better results are presented in Bhowmik, Das, Konar, Nandi, and Chakraborty (2010), where the emotion clustering is based on similarities in the EEG-related phase trajectories. For simulated data with Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) <10 dB (typical for real EEG measurements) the inter-subject discrimination accuracy achieves 84%. Lin, Wang, and Jung (2010) deals with more challenging discrimination scenario of four emotional states (joy, anger, sadness and pleasure) with the inter-subject recognition accuracy of 82%. Interesting study is published in Tomé et al. (2013), where single-trial inter-subject accuracy of 80% was obtained after feature elimination of 720 features (out of 756 initial features). The studies, where the generalization of the EEG detection of emotions across subjects is explicitly considered, have to come up with the problem of ambiguity in the appropriate feature space and its high dimensionality. Therefore, the primary motivation of this paper is to identify common neural signatures based on which the emotion valence across multiple subjects can be reliably detected. The experimental scenario is built on Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are transient components in the EEG generated in response to a stimulus (high arousal images in the present study). The discrimination problem involves high dimensional, multi-channel noisy raw data, from which the initial spatio-temporal feature space is constructed. Our goal is to define reliable mechanism for feature selection and dimensionality reduction in order to achieve robust decoding and predictions of emotional states across subjects. In our previous work (Georgieva et al., 2014), we have proposed feature dimensionality reduction by correlation-based feature selection and gain ratio feature evaluation. The intra-subject discrimination accuracy improved significantly however the inter-subject models were less affected. The experience gained suggested that a reliable multi-subject neural decoding is feasible only if the features are carefully reduced to the most discriminative features. In this paper we go further and show that the Echo State Networks (ESNs) can serve as an effective feature selection procedure that improved the discrimination of human emotion valence from ERP signals. The ESNs are dynamical structures designed to facilitate learning in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), normally applied for time series modeling. Using ESNs for static data classification and clustering gained less attention. However, there are examples in the literature like neural systems possessing multi-stable attractors (Brody, Romo, & Kepecs, 2003) that perform temporal integration aimed to discriminate between multiple alternatives. In other works (Ackley, Hinton, & Sejnowski, 1985; Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006) unsupervised learning procedures that minimize given energy function were proposed to achieve network equilibrium states that reflect given data structure. In Woodward and Ikegami (2011) it was proposed to use ESN as feature extraction stage of image classification. Their role was to “draw out” silent underlying features of the data to be used further to train a feedforward neural network classifier. In Peng, Guo, Lei, and Peng (2011) the idea to exploit equilibrium states of the ESN reservoir in order to design multiple-clusters ESN reservoirs was proposed. It was inspired by complex network topologies imitating cortical networks of the mammalian brain. In Lazar, Pipa, and Triesch (2007) it was reported that the Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) algorithm in combination with Spike-time Dependent plasticity (STDP) of synaptic weights changes the connectivity matrix of the network in such way that the recurrent connections capture the peculiarities of the input stimuli so that the network activation patterns can be separated by an unsupervised clustering technique. The idea described in the present paper was motivated initially from stability analysis of the ESN and proposed for the first time in Koprinkova-Hristova and Tontchev (2012). In this work the original multidimensional data was represented by two-dimensional (2D) projections of the reservoir steady states. The proposed (Koprinkova-Hristova & Tontchev, 2012) ESN feature selection methodology was successfully applied to solve clustering problems on a number of different data sets (Koprinkova-Hristova & Alexiev, 2013, 2014a, 2014b; Koprinkova-Hristova, Alexiev, Borisova, Jelev, & Atanassov, 2013; Koprinkova-Hristova, Angelova, Borisova, & Jelev, 2013; Koprinkova-Hristova, Doukovska, & Kostov, 2013). The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture NeuCube proposed by Kasabov (2014) is an effective reservoir-based approach for spatio-temporal brain data processing (such as dynamic EEG data) and the feature extraction is inherent in the model. However, in the present study guided by experts with neurophysiological domain knowledge, static features suitable for neurological interpretation are first extracted from the EEG data, i.e. amplitudes and latency of early/late brain waves. Besides keeping the physical meaning of the original feature space, the conversion of averaged ERP signals into static feature vectors is a way to deal with huge amount of data collected from many subjects over multiple sessions and trials (big data issues). The main contribution of this paper is the robust ERP-based emotion valence recognition system validated for high dimensional data of 26 subjects. In order to reduce the high variability of neural osculation between subjects, we propose to use the Echo State Network (ESN) as a general framework for extracting the most discriminative, less subject specific features. The novelty of the IP tuned reservoir consists in creating low dimensional projections (2D, 3D, etc.) from all ESN features (reservoir neurons equilibrium states) and find the optimal projections that maximize the recognition accuracy. The intuition behind is to consider these projections as “views” from different angles to the multidimensional feature space, i.e. in this way we “rotate” and “explore” the feature space from different “viewpoints”. The proposed approach was validated by experiments with standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. This solution is important because such decision making systems constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and clinical applications. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 our novel Intrinsic Plasticity (IP)-based algorithm for feature extraction from the ESN reservoir equilibrium states is presented. In Section 3 we describe the ERP data set. In Section 4 the relevance of the ESN-extracted features for subject independent emotion valance discrimination is validated by experiments with standard clustering and classification techniques. Discussion of the results and conclusions are summarized in Section 5. 2 ESN reservoir training with intrinsic plasticity 2.1 Echo state networks Echo State Networks (ESN) represent a class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) where the RNN (called reservoir) is generated randomly and remains unchanged during network training (Lukosevicius & Jaeger, 2009). Only the RNN output (the readout) is trained. This new approach to RNN design and training was proposed independently by Wolfgang Maass under the name Liquid State Machines (Maass, Natschlaeger, & Markram, 2002) and by Herbert Yaeger under the name of Echo State Networks (Jaeger, 2001) and is nowadays collectively referred to as Reservoir Computing (RC). Major advances in the overall field have been published in Schrauwen, Wandermann, Verstraeten, Steil, and Stroobandt (2008). The basic structure of an ESN, presented in Fig. 1 , consists of a reservoir of randomly connected dynamic neurons with sigmoid nonlinearities f res (usually hyperbolic tangent): (1) r ( k ) = f res ( W in i n ( k ) + W res r ( k − 1 ) ) and a linear readout f out (usually identity function) at the output: (2) out ( k ) = f out ( W out [ in ( k ) r ( k ) ] ) . Here k denotes discrete time instant; in ( k ) is a vector of network inputs, r ( k ) —a vector of the reservoir neurons states and out ( k ) —a vector of network outputs; n in , n out and n r are the dimensions of the corresponding vectors in, out and r respectively; W out is a trainable n out × ( n in + n r ) matrix; W in and W res are n r × n in and n r × n r matrices that are randomly generated and are not trainable. In some applications direct connection from the input to the readout is omitted. The main advantage of the ESN is the simplified training algorithm since only weights of the connections from the reservoir to the readout neurons are subject to training. Thus instead of the backpropagation-through-time learning much faster least squares method can be used. The key idea is that having rich enough reservoirs of nonlinearities will allow to approximate quite complex nonlinear dependence between input and output vectors by tuning only the linear readout weights (Jaeger, 2001). Although the reservoir connections and their weights are randomly generated, in order to prevent improper behavior of ESN, the reservoir needs to possess the so called “echo state property” as formulated in Jaeger (2001). The basic rule formulation is: the effect of input disturbances should vanish gradually in time that means the dynamic reservoir must be stable. According to this rule, a reservoir weight matrix with spectral radius below one needs to be generated. However as pointed out in Lukosevicius and Jaeger (2009) this condition will not guaranty ESN stable behavior in general. Therefore, many task-dependent recipes for improvement of reservoir connections were proposed, see Verstraeten, Schrauwen, D’Haene, and Stroobandt (2007) for a brief review. 2.2 Intrinsic plasticity Since one of the laws of thermodynamics says that any stable stationary state has a local maximum of entropy (Haddad, Chellaboina, & Nersesov, 2005), it can be expected that maximization of entropy at the ESN reservoir output could increase its stability. This motivated several works proposing ESN reservoir improvement by its entropy maximization (Ozturk, Xu, & Principe, 2007). Other authors proposed the biologically motivated adaptation rule called Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) based on mechanisms of changing neural excitability in response to the distribution of the input stimuli (Schrauwen et al., 2008; Steil, 2007). In Koprinkova-Hristova and Palm (2011) we have shown that in fact IP training achieves balance between maximization of entropy at the ESN reservoir output and its concentration around the pre-specified mean value increasing at the same time reservoir stability. IP adaptation rule aims at maximization of information transmission through the ESN that is equivalent to its output entropy maximization. A gradient method for adjusting the biases and an additional gain term was implemented. The goal is to achieve the desired distribution of the outputs by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence: (3) D K L ( p ( r ) , p d ( r ) ) = ∫ p ( r ) log ( p ( r ) p d ( r ) ) d r . That is a measure of the difference between the actual p ( r ) and the desired p d ( r ) probability distribution of reservoir outputs r . Since the commonly used transfer function of neurons is the hyperbolic tangent, the proper target distribution that maximizes the information at the output according to Schrauwen et al. (2008) is the Gaussian distribution with variance σ and mean μ : (4) p d ( r ) = 1 σ 2 π exp ( − ( r − μ ) 2 2 σ 2 ) . Hence Eq. (3) can be rearranged as follows: (5) D K L ( p ( r ) , p d ( r ) ) = − H ( r ) + 1 2 σ 2 E ( ( r − μ ) 2 ) + log 1 σ 2 π , where H denotes entropy. The last term in (5) is constant and the second term determines the deviation of the reservoir output r from the desired mean value. The minimization of (5) is a compromise between the entropy maximization and the minimization of the distance between μ and r . In order to achieve this effect two additional reservoir parameters–the gain a and the bias b (both vectors with size n r )–are introduced as follows: (6) r ( k ) = f res ( diag ( a ) W in in ( k ) + diag ( a ) W res r ( k − 1 ) + b ) . The IP training is a procedure that adjusts vectors a and b using iterative gradient descent as follows: a it = a it − 1 + Δ a b it = b it − 1 + Δ b where it denotes iteration number and the gradients Δ a and Δ b are derivatives of Kullback–Leibler divergence with respect to vectors a and b . In the case of hyperbolic tangent reservoir neurons ( f res = tanh ) the gradients are: Δ b = − η ( − μ σ 2 + r σ 2 ( 2 σ 2 + 1 − r 2 + μ r ) ) Δ a = η a + Δ bnet input net input = W in in + W res r . Here η is the learning rate. The IP procedure tends to concentrate the reservoir outputs according to the parameters of the targeted Gaussian distribution p d ( r ) in the interval [ − 3 σ , + 3 σ ] around a desired mean value μ . The equilibrium state of the reservoir r e for a constant input in c can be determined as: (7) r e = tanh ( diag ( a ) W in in c + diag ( a ) W res r e + b ) . In case b = 0 and in c = 0 , the equilibrium will be at the origin of the reservoir state space coordinate system. Otherwise it will be moved depending on the values of input in c and bias b vectors. Since the input weight matrix remains constant, the first term in the brackets will be also constant for a constant inputs in c . Thus we can consider it together with the bias term as a common bias for a given input vector: (8) r e = tanh ( diag ( a ) W res r e + b in c ) , b in c = diag ( a ) W in in c + b . The reservoir equilibrium states vary randomly within the hyperbolic tangent interval [ − 1 + 1 ] . After the IP adaptation rule they will be squeezed into the interval determined by the variance σ . The convergence of the reservoir states to the expected distributions is proven in Schrauwen et al. (2008). Typical values for the key parameters of the algorithm were chosen: zero mean ( μ = 0 ), variance σ = 0.1 , learning rate η = 0.0005 and a = 1 and b = 0 as initial values of the tinning parameters suggested by Schrauwen et al. (2008). The IP training stops when no significant changes of the equilibrium states are observed. This happens usually after 5–10 iterations. Similar conclusions were achieved in our previous experiments (Koprinkova-Hristova & Palm, 2011). The IP procedure is a non-supervised tuning algorithm that does not aim to fit network output to some target data but rather aims to fit the reservoir connections to reflect input data structure, therefore overfitting issues are not relevant. 2.3 ESN reservoir for extraction of low dimensional features During the investigations in Koprinkova-Hristova and Palm (2011) we have observed that the reservoir equilibrium states are concentrated in several regions and they depend on the input vectors. If the input vectors are close in the input space, they will result in close equilibrium points in the reservoir state. Then a question arose: is it possible to use this effect for discrimination purposes? This question formulated the main idea of the present work to consider the equilibrium reservoir states after IP training as the new feature space and extract the features with the highest discrimination capacity. The algorithm for extraction of these low dimensional feature vectors is the following: Step 1: Randomly generate the initial ESN reservoir. The topology of the ESN is defined by the input (the original) feature space. The size of the ESN input vector is equal to the number of the original features. Since we explore only the reservoir output, the size of the readout can be any positive integer value and therefore it can be set to one. Step 2: IP adaptation of the ESN reservoir states. IP adaptation rule according to (Eqs. (4)–(8)) is applied iteratively to the feature vectors of all training examples of the data set. Step 3: Calculate the equilibrium states of the reservoir neurons. Since it is hard to solve analytically the equations for the equilibrium states corresponding to each input vector in c : (9) r e = tanh ( diag ( a ) W in in c + diag ( a ) W res r e + b ) the equilibrium states r e are iteratively computed until reaching the steady state. Step 4 Generate low dimensional projections of the equilibrium states (combinations of two, three or more reservoir neurons). This is an iterative procedure consisting of the following sub-steps: (a) Create all possible two dimensional (2D) combinations of the equilibrium states of the reservoir neurons, obtained after IP training. Use these 2D combinations as features to fit classification or clustering models (e.g. k-means, FCM, etc.); rank the models based on their accuracy. (b) Select C best ranked models. Use their corresponding 2D feature vectors and generate three dimensional (3D) combinations adding one by one the rest of reservoir neurons equilibrium states. Use these 3D combinations to fit the models and rank them. (c) Select again C best ranked combinations and as in the previous step use them to create four-dimensional (4D) feature vectors; fit and rank the models. (d) Repeat the same procedure generating higher dimensional feature vectors until no significant improvement in the discrimination accuracy of the classifiers is observed. The algorithm described above is outlined in Table 1 . In the implementation of the experiments C is equal to 20. Step 4 is computationally the most expensive step. Overall, the computational complexity for building the discriminative model with each combination of neurons is factorial O ( n r − ! / ( n r − k + 1 ) ! ∗ k ! ) , where n r is the reservoir size and k is the number of neurons in the combination. In order to control the computational load in the above algorithm, only 2D projections (Step 4a) are a complete set of n r ∗ ( n r − 1 ) / 2 combinations. Choosing the C best ranked 2D projections from the previous iteration for the 3D (Step 4b) and 4D (Step 4c) subsequent steps reduces the computational complexity to linear O ( ( n r ) ) for these stages. 3 Data set description We consider learning to discriminate emotional states of human subjects, based on their brain activity observed via Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Emotional behavior is organized along two psycho-physiologic dimensions: (i) valence, varying from negative to positive, and (ii) arousal, varying from low to high. The combination of these two affective dimensions forms four emotional categories, which incorporate several discrete human emotions, such as joy, pleasure, excitement, melancholy, anger, fear, disgust, etc. It is also assumed that valence and arousal are orthogonal, independent dimensions of emotional stimulus. Thus, any emotion-related biosignal is differentiated according to its valence or arousal dimension. In the present work, the ERPs signals were recorded while 26 female volunteers were viewing pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) repository. A total of 24 high arousal (IAPS rating > 6) images with positive valence ( M = 7.29 ± 0.65 ) and negative valence ( M = 1.47 ± 0.24 ) were selected. For each image, signals from 21 EEG channels were sampled at 1 kHz and stored (see Table 2 ). Each image was presented 3 times in a pseudo-random order and each trial lasted 3500 ms: during the first 750 ms, a fixation cross was presented, then one of the images was presented during 500 ms and at last a black screen appeared during 2250 ms. The raw EEG signals were first filtered (band-pass filter between 0.1 and 30 Hz.), eye-movement corrected, baseline compensated and segmented into epochs using NeuroScan software. The single-trial signal length is 950 ms with 150 ms before the stimulus onset. The ensemble average for each condition (positive/negative valence) was also computed and filtered using a Butterworth filter of 4th order with passband [0.5–15] Hz. Thus, the filtered ensemble average signals cover the frequency band ranges corresponding to Delta ([0.5–4] Hz), Theta ([4–8] Hz) and Alpha neural activity ([8–12] Hz) (Bozhkov, Georgieva, & Trifonov, 2014). Most of the ERP-based affective state detection systems rely on the frequency content of the signals (Jatupaiboon et al., 2013). The features are measures of the ERP energy in certain frequency bands, as for example Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Spectral Power Asymmetry (SPA). However, recent studies report evidence about temporal correlates between emotional stimuli processing and the occurrence of subsequent positive and negative potentials (waves C1, P1, P2, P3) when the stimulus is loaded with intensive emotions (Pourtois, Grandjean, Sander, & Vuilleumier, 2004; Santos, Iglesias, Olivares, & Young, 2008; Stolarova, Keil, & Moratti, 2006). These waves are associated with specific time of occurrence (early/late waves). Therefore, in the present study, temporal features (amplitudes and latencies) are extracted from the filtered, segmented and ensemble averaged ERP data. Starting by the localization of the first minimum after time t = 0 s , the features are defined as a sequence of the local positive and negative picks, and their respective latencies (time of occurrence). Twelve temporal features are stored (Table 3 ) corresponding to the amplitudes of the first three local minimums ( A min 1 , A min 2 , A min 3 ), the first three local maximums ( A max 1 , A max 2 , A max 3 ), and their associated latencies ( L min 1 , L min 2 , L min 3 , L max 1 , L max 2 , L max 3 ). As a result, the initial feature set is a matrix X with dimension of 252 columns (21 channels x12 features) and 52 lines (the ensemble averaged positive and negative labeled trials of 26 subjects). The three-step algorithm proposed in Section 2 (Table 1) for ESN-based feature selection is applied on the normalized feature matrix (10) X ̄ = X − mean ( X ) std ( X ) . 4 Emotion valence discrimination—experimental results In this section we use the ESN extracted features to discriminate the positive and negative emotion valence across multiple subjects. In order to eliminate the problem of choosing the “wrong” or the “lucky” learning model we tested various standard learning techniques: k-means and fuzzy C-means clustering (unsupervised methods) and five classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree) as supervised methods. The size of the ESN input vector corresponds to the number of the original features (in this case 252 features). The size of the reservoir varies between 10 and 500 neurons. The results with 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 300 and 500 neurons are visualized on the next figures and tables. 4.1 Clustering approach We compare the discrimination capacity of k-means and fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithms for varying reservoir dimension provided with the following feature sets: (i) All equilibrium states of the reservoir (ESN all); (ii) Two dimensional combinations of equilibrium states. In Fig. 2 are presented only the results with the 2D feature sets that maximize the accuracy of each clustering method (ESN 2D); (iii) The original feature matrix X from Eq. (7) (orig). The results are summarized in Fig. 2. The achieved accuracy values (%) are given in Table 4 . Clustering based on the best 2D combinations of equilibrium states (ESN 2D) outperform by far the clustering using all reservoir equilibrium states (ESN all) or direct clustering of the original feature matrix Eq. (7) (orig). Note that the clustering based on ESN all is worse (particularly when the reservoir size increases) compared to the direct clustering with orig. Thus, the original features X and the set of all equilibrium states (for large variation of the reservoir dimension from 10 to 500 neurons) do not provide better discrimination than a random chance and therefore are not appropriate for inter-subject discrimination models. In contrast, 2D features extracted particularly from reservoirs with high number of neurons (150, 300, 500) achieve close to 80% accuracy which is very promising result in the context of this challenging application. 4.2 Classification approach Now we apply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees (DT), to discriminate the emotion valence for the following feature set scenarios: (i) All equilibrium states of the reservoir (Fig. 3 ); (ii) Two dimensional combinations of equilibrium states (the first iteration of step 4 of the algorithm presented in Section 2.3). In Fig. 4 are presented only the results with the 2D feature sets that maximize the classification accuracy of each classifier; (iii) Three dimensional combinations of equilibrium states (the second iteration of step 4 of the algorithm in Section 2.3). The combinations are obtained from the best twenty 2D combinations of reservoir states kept at the first iteration. In Fig. 5 are presented the results with the best 3D feature vectors of each classifier; (iv) Four dimensional combinations of equilibrium states (the third iteration of step 4 of the algorithm in Section 2.3). The combinations are obtained from the best 3D combinations of reservoir states kept at the second iteration. In Fig. 6 are presented the results with the best 4D feature vectors. At each training iteration, data belonging to one subject (26 subjects in total) is left aside and used for model testing (leave-one-subject-out cross validation). Thus, 26-fold cross validation is performed and only testing results are presented in the paper. The general observation in all scenarios is that increasing the reservoir dimension improves the classification accuracy. This tendency is related with the increasing number of combinations and therefore higher search resolution for discovering the best discriminative feature vectors. Note however, that scenario (i) seems not affected by the variation in the reservoir size. The accuracy values (%) associated with Figs. 3–6 are given in Tables 5–8 , respectively. Another interesting observation is that overall the classification techniques outperform the clustering methods, particularly when all equilibrium states are considered as features. The auto-encoder training in deep neural networks (DNN) and the subsequent hidden layer extraction have a similar interpretation as the system of ESN ( 2 D ⇒ 3 D ⇒ 4 D feature combinations) and a classifier proposed here. We made experiments with DNN varying the hidden layer (HL) dimensions: HL1 (100-30), HL2 (50-20), HL3 (40-1). The best results were obtained for DNN topology of (20-5-1), with only 60% of achieved testing accuracy. The confusion matrix is TP = 15 ; TN = 16 ; FP = 11 ; FN = 10 . Both classes are equally misclassified. 5 Conclusions In this paper an inter-subject valence recognition system is proposed, where the Echo State Networks (ESN) are introduced as a mechanism for selecting the most relevant discriminative features between multiple subjects. The low dimensional feature vectors are extracted from the equilibrium states of the ESN reservoir, obtained after Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) adaptation. The algorithm proposed generates iteratively low dimensional combinations of the reservoir equilibrium states, starting from 2D combinations and subsequent higher order combinations build upon the best performing lower order feature vectors. The relevance of the ESN extracted feature vectors was validated by experiments with typical clustering and classification techniques. 80% of correct clustering of the positive and negative emotion valence across multiple subjects obtained with feature vectors having the surprising low dimension of 2 elements is a very promising result in the context of this challenging application. Moreover, 95% correct classification obtained with 4D feature vectors outperform all previously published results of affective computing based on brain neural data (ERPs). The price to pay for this significant discrimination improvement is the computational time required to test all feature vector combinations and extract the most discriminative ones. This problem is particularly relevant for big reservoirs. For example for a reservoir with 500 neurons, 124750 combinations of 2D equilibrium states need to be analyzed. If higher order combinations (3D, 4D) or more neurons are required this number increases exponentially. Therefore, in the algorithm we proposed in Section 2.3, this problem is controlled by the iterative way of generating higher order combinations as a function of only a small portion of neurons that gained this privilege at the previous iteration (the C best ranked low-dimensional combinations at the previous step). The choice of C = 20 reflects computational power restrictions. There is a certain analogy between the dimensionality reduction approach we propose here and the genetic optimization where the initial population can be seen as the complete set of reservoir equilibrium states. At each iteration we make new equilibrium states combinations using the best combination(s) at the previous iteration, which is very much the same with the renovation of the genetic population. We believe that from one side this work enhances the usability context of the ESN for high dimensional static data representations by low dimensional feature transformation as functions of the reservoir states. From other side, learning to decode human emotions from ERPs is an important problem because such decision making systems constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and medical applications.

        "doc_abstract": "© 2013 IEEE.Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) is the most studied noninvasive interface to build a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. However, correlated noises in EEG measurements still constitute a significant challenge. Alternatively, building BCIs based on filtered brain activity source signals instead of using their surface projections, obtained from the noisy EEG signals, is a promising and not well-explored direction. In this context, finding the locations and waveforms of inner brain sources represents a crucial task for advancing source-based noninvasive BCI technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel multicore beamformer particle filter (multicore BPF) to estimate the EEG brain source spatial locations and their corresponding waveforms. In contrast to conventional (single-core) beamforming spatial filters, the developed multicore BPF considers explicitly temporal correlation among the estimated brain sources by suppressing activation from regions with interfering coherent sources. The hybrid multicore BPF brings together the advantages of both deterministic and Bayesian inverse problem algorithms in order to improve the estimation accuracy. It solves the brain activity localization problem without prior information about approximate areas of source locations. Moreover, the multicore BPF reduces the dimensionality of the problem to half compared with the PF solution, thus alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. The results, based on generated and real EEG data, show that the proposed framework recovers correctly the dominant sources of brain activity.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2015 IEEE.Localization of the brain neural generators that create Electroencephalographs (EEGs) has been an important problem in clinical, research and technological applications related to the brain. The active regions in the brain are modeled as equivalent current dipoles, and the positions and moments of these dipoles or brain sources are estimated. So far, the brain dipoles are assumed to be fixed or time-invariant. However, recent neurological studies are showing that brain sources are not static but vary (in terms of location and moment) depending on various internal and external stimuli. This paper presents a shift in the current paradigm of brain source localization by considering dynamic sources in the brain. We formulate the brain source estimation problem from EEG measurements as a (nonlinear) state-space model. We use the Particle Filter (PF), essentially a sequential Monte Carlo method, to track the trajectory of the moving dipoles in the brain. We further address the \"curse of dimensionality,\" issue of the PF by taking advantage of the structure of the EEG state-space model, and marginalizing out the linearly evolving states. A Kalman Filter is used to optimally estimate the linear elements, whereas the PF is used to track only the non-linear components. This technique reduces the dimension of the problem; thus exponentially reducing the computational cost. Our simulation results show that, where the PF fails, the Marginalized PF is able to successfully track two dipoles in the brain with only 500 particles.",

During the tests with the three shopping platforms, quantitative data was collected via computerised questionnaire. High and Low class users were statistically extracted, corresponding to the high or low probability to buy or recommend the advertised brand. The results show that Markerless AR system clearly outperforms the Marker-based AR and the Plain Interactive in terms of positive attitude from the users.

First, we provide a framework for selection of a small number of basic temporal features, event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes, and latencies that are sufficiently robust to discriminate emotion states across multiple subjects. Second, we test comparatively the feasibility of six standard unsupervised (clustering) techniques to build intra-subject and inter-subject models to discriminate emotion valence in the ERPs collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content.",

Published by Elsevier B.V. 375 for brain imaging are the Electroencephalography (EEG), the Magneto-EncephaloGraphy (MEG), functional Magneto Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Among them the EEG modality has attracted more attention because it is a nonin- vasive, cheap and relatively easy to apply technology [8]. Most of the EEG-based emotion recognition systems build an individual model for every subject (intra-subject models) [4]. Building inter-subject (subject independent) models is a harder problem due to the high EEG variability between individuals. In [6] a real-time classification of happy/unhappy emotions elicited by pictures and classical music is proposed. The combination of features extracted from the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the EEG signal and the Support Vector machine (SVM) classifier resulted into 75.62% classification accuracy for the intra-subject models and significantly lower (62.12%) accuracy for the inter-subject generalization. Better results are presented in [1], where the emotion clustering is based on similarities in the EEG-related phase trajectories. For simulated data with Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) less than 10 dB (typical for real EEG measurements) the inter-subject discrimination accuracy achieves 84%. [7] deals with more challenging discrimination scenario of four emotional states (joy, anger, sadness and pleasure) with inter-subject recognition accuracy of 82%. Interesting study is published in [10], where the single-trial inter-subject accuracy of 80% is obtained after feature elimination of 720 features (out of 756 initial features). The goal of this paper is to identify the relevant patterns encoded in the EEG data that enable automatic detection of human emotions and its generalization across various subjects (subject independent affective computing model). The experimental scenario is built on Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are transient components in the EEG generated in response to stimulus (images with intensive emotional content in this study). The discrimination prob- lem involves high dimensional, multi-channel noisy raw data, from which the spatio-temporal features are extracted. The paper is organized as follows. Data set and feature extraction are described in section 2. The feature selection strategies and classification models are presented in section 3. The conclusions are summarized in section 4. 2 Data set and feature extraction 26 female volunteers participated in this study. The brain activity was registered by ERPs recorded while the volunteers were viewing images eliciting pleasant or unpleasant emotions selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) repository. A total of 24 high arousal (IAPS rating above 6) images with positive (M=7.29 +/- 0.65) and negative (M=1.47 +/- 0.24) valence were selected. For each image, signals from 21 channels (Table 1), positioned according to the 10-20 system were sampled at 1kHz. Each image was presented 3 times in a pseudo-random order and each trial lasted 3500 ms. The raw brain signals were first filtered (band-pass filter between 0.1 and 30Hz.), eye-movement corrected, baseline compensated and segmented into epochs using NeuroScan software. The first step to reduce the big ERP variability among subjects was to get averaged signals of all positive and negative trials per subject. The averaged ERP signals were filtered using a Butterworth filter of 4th order with passband [0.5-15] Hz. Most of the ERP-based affective state detection systems rely on the frequency content of the signals [6]. The features are measures of the ERP energy in certain frequency bands, such as Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Spectral Power Asymmetry (SPA). However, recent study [9] reports evidence about temporal correlates between emotional stimuli processing and the occurrence of subsequent positive and negative potentials when the stimulus is loaded with intensive emotions. These waves are associated with specific time of occurrence (early/late ...... . . . Bozhkov at al., 376 waves). Following these assumptions, in this study, temporal features (amplitude and latency) are extracted from the averaged ERP signals. Starting by the localization of the first minimum after t=0, the features are defined as a sequence of local positive and negative peaks, and their associated latencies (time of occurrence). For each channel, twelve temporal features are stored (Table 1) corresponding to the amplitudes of the first three local minimums (Amin1, Amin2, Amin3), the first three local maximums (Amax1, Amax2, Amax3), and their respective latencies (Lmin1, Lmin2, Lmin3, Lmax1, Lmax2, Lmax3). As a result, the initial feature matrix X has 252 columns (21 channels x12 features) and 52 lines (the ensemble averaged positive and negative labeled trials of 26 subjects). The feature elimination strategies proposed in section 3 are applied to normalized data set X norm = X âˆ’mean(X))/std(X). 3 Feature elimination and classification Prior to feature elimination step, classification using all spatio-temporal features was performed. Five standard classifiers were tested: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression (LogReg) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Nave Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees (DT), the results are summarized in Table 2. Most of the classifiers exhibit high accuracy on training data and low accuracy on testing examples - a typical overfilling problem. Discrimination models based on the sparse data matrix X (high number of attributes and low number of samples) are not able to generalize the learned valence classes over new subjects. Classification did not improve after standard PCA feature elimination (Table 2). Discrimination models based on 43, 34, 16 or 7 principal components, corresponding to 99, 95, 75 or 50% of retained data variance, exhibit event worse generalization properties. PCA decorrelates data by removing 2nd-order dependencies which is insufficient for data with higher order dependencies (nonlinearities). Classification after spatial and temporal feature selection Recent study [5] reports on correlation of emotion valence with stronger response in the cen- tral cortical line and when visual stimulus elicit the emotion stronger response is observed in the parietal and occipital brain zones. In order to explore these hypotheses individual classifiers are trained for each spatial feature (single channel) with all temporal features per channel. Al- ternatively, independent classifiers for each temporal feature over all channels were also trained. The performance of 21 spatially distributed classifiers based on 12 temporal features, are shown in Fig. 1, and the performance of 12 classifiers, based on 21 replication of the same temporal feature over all channels, are shown in Fig. 2. The final discrimination decision is obtained by the majority vote of the ensemble of five classifiers (LD, kNN, NB, SVM, DT) - the VOTE classifier. The following observations can be stated: i) The occipital channel Oz and the pari- etal channel P7 achieved the best performance (above 80%); ii) The discrimination capacity of the occipital and parietal channels, particularly the central channels (Oz, Cz, Pz), is higher; iii) The latencies (Lmin3, Lmax3, Lmin3) are more reliable descriptors; iv) The spatial fea- tures encode better the class information and are less variable across subjects than temporal features. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis for human emotions encoding into electro-physiological correlates, [5]. Classification after Sequential Feature Selection Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) is an iterative procedure that makes an exhaustive search over all possible combinations of features to find the one that maximizes the classification per- formance. Starting from an empty set, SFS increments a new feature elected as the best class ...... . . .

The VOTE classification accuracy (98%) is superior to any related system reported in the literature. The selected spatio-temporal features are listed in Table 4. The principal electro-physiological correlates with the emotion valence are spatially located at the the frontal, occipital and parietal channels. Late waves are less subject dependent features. These results are consistent with the classification after independent spatial and temporal fea- ture selection. Classification after feature elimination based on data descriptive statistics SFS identifies the most relevant features across subjects, however it is a computationally heavy procedure.

The features are ranked by the distance between the means or the difference between the standard deviations of their class distributions. First, the classification is performed with the top ranked feature and then subsequently a new feature is added with the next best rank. Thus, instead of exhaustive search among all possible combinations of features from the complete feature set (the SFS approach), the search is confined only among statistically discriminable features. The method is independent of the learning algorithm, computationally simple and scalable. The results of this iterative classification are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The discrim- inative performance (88.46%) of the best classifier, obtained with seven top ranked features and VOTE classifier, is lower than the SFS-based VOTE classifier. However, it outperforms the classification models with independent spatial and temporal feature selection or PCA.

Bozhkov at al., 381 4 Conclusions The main contribution of this paper is the robust EEG-based emotion valence recognition sys- tem validated for high dimensional data of 26 subjects. In order to reduce the high variability of neural osculations between subjects, selection of most discriminative, less subject specific fea- tures is of great importance. Among various alternatives, Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) provides the most confident features based on which discrimination models with high general- ization capacity over new subjects were obtained. However, SFS is a computationally heavy procedure that may take days to finish. In contrast, an empirical feature elimination technique was proposed based on descriptive statistics as a compromise between computational time (it takes a few minutes) and discrimination performance (lower than with the SFS). Both methods are consistent in selecting the parietal and occipital channels as better encoders of the class information and less variable across subjects. Temporal correlation between visual emotional stimulus and the occurrence of local potentials is more discriminative with respect to late waves (P200, P300). Emotion valence recognition is an interesting topic, however limited to only two states. The number of participants in the experiments is also important for revealing stable cross subject features. In the reviewed references the average number of participants is about 10-15. Publicly available datasets are required to compare different techniques. References [1] P. Bhowmik, S. Das, A. Konar, D.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based affective computing is a new research field that aims to find neural correlates between human emotions and the registered EEG signals. Typically, emo- tion recognition systems are personalized, i.e. the discrimination models are subject-dependent. Building subject-independent models is a harder problem due to the high EEG variability be- tween individuals. In this paper we propose a unified system for efficient discrimination of positive and negative emotions in a group of 26 users. The users were exposed to high arousal affective images and the recorded brain signals differentiated according to their positive and negative valence. Major challenge in building subject independent affective models is to iden- tify the most discriminative features between subjects. The focus of the present study is to find a relevant feature selection approach that extracts features suitable for neurophysiological interpretation and validation. Spatial (channels) and temporal (brain waves peaks and their respective latencies) features are extracted from the EEG signals. The feature selection strate- gies explored (Independent spatial and temporal feature selection, Sequential Feature Selection, Feature Elimination based on data descriptive statistics) are consistent in selecting parietal and occipital channels and late waves (P200, P300) as better encoder of the emotion valence state and less variable across subjects. These results are in line with neurophysiological hypothesis of visually elicited human emotions - brain activity correlation. The relevance of the selected features was validated by five standard and one majority vote classifiers.

EEG signals are collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content. This problem is important because such classifiers constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and clinical applications. The feature selection has a major role. Recently we have proposed a sequential feature selection (SFS) procedure that reduced the inherent data variability among subjects and led to a high intersubject emotion recognition accuracy (98 %). However the SFS is a computationally intensive approach that is difficult to apply to any classification model. In this paper we extend that line of research and propose a computationally less involved feature selection technique based on descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the neural signatures across subjects. This approach reveals to be a good compromise between prediction accuracy and numerical complexity.",

The brain zones with the strongest activity are expressed at a macro level by a few number of active brain dipoles. Normally, for solving the EEG inverse problem, fixed dipole locations are assumed, independently of the different stimuli that excite the brain. The proposed particle filter (PF) framework presents a shift in the current paradigm by estimating dynamic brain dipoles, which may vary from one location to another in the brain depending on internal/external stimuli that may affect the brain. Also, in contrast to previous solutions, the proposed PF algorithm estimates simultaneously, the number of the active dipoles, their moving locations and their respective oscillations in the three dimensional head geometry.",

This paper summarizes the results of applying supervised machine learning (ML) methods to the problem of classifying emotional states of human subjects based on EEG. In particular, we compare six ML algorithms to distinguish event-related potentials, associated with the processing of different emotional valences, collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content. 98% inter-subject classification accuracy based on the majority of votes between all classifiers is the main achievement of this paper, which outperforms previous published results. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",

Our simulations show that the proposed algorithm can reconstruct reliably the few most active (the dominant) brain sources that have generated the registered EEG measurements.

Among several difficulties, the huge number of features (voxels) is a major obstacle for reliable discrimination of common patterns across brains. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely applied for learning of low dimensional linear data models in image processing.The main drawback of the traditional PCA is that it is a least-square technique that fails to account for outliers. Previous attempts to make PCA robust have treated the entire image as an outlier. However, the fMRIs may contain undesirable artifacts due to errors related with the brain scanning process, alignment errors or pixels that are corrupted by noise. In this paper we propose a new dimensionality reduction approach based on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) that uses an intra-sample outlier process to account for pixel outliers. The RPCA improves classification accuracy of two cognitive brain states across various subjects compared to using conventional PCA or not performing dimensionality reduction. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Most of the reconstruction techniques rely on imaging models, where the neural activity is described by a dense set of current dipoles. On the other hand, the point source models, which employ a small number of equivalent current dipoles, has received less attention. While both approaches (imaging versus current dipoles) have their own issues, the main advantage of the dipole models is that they approximate summaries of evoked responses or helpful first approximations. In this paper, we use a recursive Bayesian estimation technique, known as Particle Filter (PF), to simultaneously reconstruct the spatial locations within the head and the corresponding waveforms of the most active dipoles that originated the EEG sensor data. Normally, in EEG source reconstruction, fixed dipole locations are assumed. The proposed PF framework presents a shift in the current paradigm by estimating moving EEG sources, which may vary from one location to another in the brain reflecting the underlying brain activity. Our computer simulations, based on generated and real EEG data, show that the proposed PF approach estimates the dynamic EEG sources with high fidelity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

Beamforming (BF) gives estimates of the respective source moments. In order to validate this novel approach for brain source localization, EEG data from dipoles with known locations and known moments are generated and artificially corrupted with noise. The noise represents the overall influence of other brain sources but they are not brain disturbances. When the power of the EEG signal due to the main brain sources is higher than the summed effect of all other secondary sources, the estimation of the localization of the leading sources is reliable and repetitive over a number of Monte Carlo runs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The operation of such processes poses very challenging problems mainly those inherent to its batch nature and also those due to the difficulties in measuring key process variables. Inadequate control policies lead to out-of-spec batches, with consequent losses resulting from the need of product recycling. In order to address these problems, a modification of the general Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is proposed in this paper, where the NMPC is executed only when the tracking error is outside a pre-specified bound α. Once the error converges towards the α-strip, the NMPC is switched off and the control action is kept constant. In order to further reduce the complexity of the control system, the proposed modification, termed Error Tolerant MPC (ETMPC), is provided with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) predictive model. The ETMPC. +. RNN control scheme was extensively tested on a crystallizer dynamic simulator, tuned with data from two industrial units, and compared with the classical NMPC and PI strategy. The results demonstrate that both NMPC and ETMPC controllers lead to improved end point process specifications, when compared with the PI controller. The explicit introduction of the error tolerance in the optimization relaxes the computational burden and can complement several other suggestions in the literature for feasible industrial real time control. © 2010 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.",

Research highlights ▶ Model Predictive Control based on Neural Network models. ▶ Error Tolerance by the execution of the MPC optimization (ETMPC). ▶ Control application to industrial fed batch sugar crystallization simulators. ▶ Less product recycling, less computational cost, improved final product characteristics (mean sugar particle size and variation). This paper addresses the issue of developing feasible advanced control strategies for the operation of industrial fed-batch multi-stage sugar crystallization processes. The operation of such processes poses very challenging problems mainly those inherent to its batch nature and also those due to the difficulties in measuring key process variables. Inadequate control policies lead to out-of-spec batches, with consequent losses resulting from the need of product recycling. In order to address these problems, a modification of the general Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is proposed in this paper, where the NMPC is executed only when the tracking error is outside a pre-specified bound α. Once the error converges towards the α-strip, the NMPC is switched off and the control action is kept constant. In order to further reduce the complexity of the control system, the proposed modification, termed Error Tolerant MPC (ETMPC), is provided with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) predictive model. The ETMPC+RNN control scheme was extensively tested on a crystallizer dynamic simulator, tuned with data from two industrial units, and compared with the classical NMPC and PI strategy. The results demonstrate that both NMPC and ETMPC controllers lead to improved end point process specifications, when compared with the PI controller. The explicit introduction of the error tolerance in the optimization relaxes the computational burden and can complement several other suggestions in the literature for feasible industrial real time control.

Within those types of production lines, crystallization is often a core unit operation, either as the main production process, sugar crystallization being a good example, or as a major downstream unit for purification or isolation, as found in many pharmaceutical or biotech production lines. The economic and performance objectives of batch or fed-batch operations are essentially focused at the end of the process (Nagy and Braatz, 2003). In the case of crystallization processes, operation is normally carried out having as reference a pre-specified final product quality, expressed by the final mass average size of crystals (AM) and the respective final size distribution, the latter measured by its coefficient of variation (CV). In this paper we study the operation of industrial fed-batch multi-stage sugar crystallization processes, in a collaborative work with two sugar factories (Sugar refinery RAR.SA, Portugal and Company 30 de Noviembre, Pinar del Río, Cuba). The main challenge of the sugar production is the batch to batch variation of AM and CV. This lack of process repeatability is the result of several perturbations, viz. (i) in the feed characteristics (brix and impurities); (ii) in the seeding characteristics; (iii) in nucleation rates; (iv) in evaporation rates; (v) in process variables that affect supersaturation, which in turn is the main control variable of the crystal growth rates. Control policies based on Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are known to have poor performances in guiding the process along optimal paths, when facing such process loads (Burns, 2001). This results in out-of-spec productions that lead to the need of product recycling, with the associated economical losses. It is thus of significant industrial interest to search and implement alternative (advanced) operation policies, aiming at maximizing production, while minimizing costs by reducing such energy and material losses. 1.2 Model-based predictive control in sugar industry The model-based predictive control (MPC) concept was introduced in the eighties (Clarke et al., 1987) and nowadays became an attractive and relevant control strategy in many practical applications. The first industrial implementations of MPC were based on linear models (Morari, 1994) and later on, nonlinear cases such as reactive distillation columns (Balasubramhanya and Doyle, 2000) and polymerization reactors (Seki et al., 2001) were reported. Though its recognized success in a variety of process industries (Camacho and Bordons, 2004) only over the last decade research on MPC for sugar plants has started. Yet, sugar production is still a very heuristically operated process, with PID controllers being the most typical solution. This is primarily due to the lack of reliable techniques for on-line measurements of crystal qualities of interest, namely; CSD, crystal morphology and purity (de Prada et al., 2008) and its categorization as a non-high value industry. First, linear MPC controller (LMPC) has been applied to a continuous sugar plant (Bordons and Camacho, 2000; Prada et al., 2000) and latter on to a mixed batch/continuous (hybrid) system combined with a scheduling algorithm (Sarabia et al., 2007, 2006). The mixed-integer (MI) optimization has been considered in Kaya and Noakes (2003) for a sequence of batch and continuous sugar units. The process scheduling is formulated as a MILP optimization problem, where the decision variables are the times to start the operation of each batch unit and the duration of each batch. LMPC was also proposed in Nott and Lee (1999) to schedule the process stages and the final sugar production. The present study was preceded by an introductory work to implement LMPC only to the crystallization phase of the same sugar plant (Sánchez Dediós et al., 2006). A new identification procedure was proposed in Sánchez Dediós et al. (2006) to refine the linear crystallization model. Though some improvements were registered, only one of the tested LMPC scenarios (controlled output – supersaturation, manipulated input – steam flowrate) satisfied all conflicting control objectives. The accumulated conclusion (Paz Suárez et al., 2009a, 2009b) was that a nonlinear MPC (NMPC) would meet better the sugar production quality requirements. However, on-line implementation of MPC with predictions running on a large number of nonlinear differential and algebraic equations (DAE), i.e. the first principles process model, is a huge challenge that may lead to feasibility problems for processes with fast nonlinear dynamics (as some of the sugar production stages) or brings numerical problems (e.g. stiffness, ill-conditioning). Moreover, in many cases development of first principles models is difficult and time consuming (see Appendix A). Several suggestions have been made to attack these problems ranging from simple extension of Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC) based on successive linearization of the nonlinear model to more elaborate techniques involving discretization of the model followed by solution via nonlinear programming (Zavala et al., 2008). These solutions are usually computationally very intensive and feasible assuming unlimited computational resources, which is only valid for high value products and industries with modern control equipment. However, sugar plants are typically equipped with not state-of-the-art and in some cases over a decade old control hardware. In order to address these problems in the framework of the particular application, a modification of the general NMPC is proposed in this paper, where the NMPC is executed only when the tracking error is outside a pre-specified bound. Once the error converges towards the strip, the NMPC is switched off and the control action is kept constant. This explicit introduction of the error tolerance (ET) in the optimization relaxes the computational burden and can complement several other suggestions in the literature for feasible industrial real time control. In order to further reduce the complexity of the control system, the proposed modification, termed Error Tolerant Model Predictive Controller (ETMPC), is provided with a data-based predictive model, namely a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Over the past two decades the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been frequently used in modeling and control of nonlinear processes (Kambhampati et al., 2000; Nahas et al., 1992). It is because they have many advantages. More specifically, NNs can approximate nonlinear behavior of dynamical processes. ANNs are trained using available data sets, thus the necessity to develop comprehensive first principles models is avoided. Unlike fundamental models, neural models have simple structure and relatively small number of parameters. As a result, numerical problems typical of MPC algorithms based on complex systems of DAE are not encountered. However, there is very little research work published using ANNs as a sugar crystallization model. For example in Rohani et al. (1999) a feed forward NN (FFNN)-based NMPC of a continuous KC1 cooling crystallizer process was demonstrated to outperform Quadratic DMC with linear ARX model. Most of the dynamical system approximations are based on FFNNs, data driven models without feedback connections. However, following recent advances in ANN research (Schaefer et al., 2008) RNNs seem most suitable for modeling purposes since they can encode past and current input–output information and thus approximate dynamical relationships. In the present work we make a step towards analyzing the suitability of a RNN as a reliable model in the sugar crystallization context. In all, the potential innovative aspects of the present work are focused on the explicit introduction of the error tolerance in the MPC formulation (ETMPC) and the RNN predictive models in the framework of a challenging multiple stages sugar crystallization. The potential benefits of the ETMPC+RNN control scheme, compared with other typical control solutions are analyzed over the rest of the paper. 1.3 Scope and report structure From a systems engineering point of view, this multi-stage fed-batch process can be found, with due adaptations, in a significant number of industrial processes. Therefore, the RNN-based ETMPC strategy developed for the present industrial case has the potential to be further extended and applied to other processes. This paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 the general NMPC problem is stated in a discrete form; Section 3 presents the Error Tolerant MPC strategy and in Section 4 the RNN predictive model is discussed; Section 5 comprises a short description of the sugar crystallization process; control tests and comparative results with ETMPC, NMPC and PI controllers are presented and discussed in Section 6; finally, the concluding remarks are addressed in Section 7. 2 Discretized NMPC problem Although individually different in form, the underlying idea of all MPC schemes can be summarized as follows: (i) a dynamic model and on-line measurements are used to predict the future process behavior; (ii) on the basis of the process output predictions, optimization is performed to find a sequence of manipulated input moves that minimizes a chosen performance index while satisfying all given constrains; (iii) only the first of the calculated input sequence is implemented and the whole optimization is repeated at the next sampling time. The on-line NMPC implementation has usually a discrete form, where the exact optimization is substituted by a discrete approximation and transformed into nonlinear programming (NLP). The continuous time t ∈ t 0 , t f is divided into equally spaced time intervals Δt, with discrete time steps t k = t 0 + kΔt and k =0, 1, …, N. For the purposes of this study we consider the following performance index: (1) min [ u ( t k + 1 ) , u ( t k + 2 ) , … , u ( t k + H C ) ] J = λ 1 ∑ k = 1 H p ( e ( t k ) ) 2 + λ 2 ∑ k = 1 H c ( Δ u ( t k ) ) 2 where e(t k )= ref(t k )− y(t k ) denotes the process output (y) deviation from its respective reference (ref) and Δu(t k )= u(t k )− u(t k−1) are the manipulated input increments. Parameters λ 1 and λ 2 determine the contribution of the sum of the squares of the output error and the control increments over the performance index. The cost function (1) has to be minimized subject to the following constraints: (2.1) x ( t k + 1 ) = f [ x ( t k ) , u ( t k ) , s ( t k ) ] (2.2) y ( t k ) = h [ x ( t k ) , s ( t k ) ] (3.1) q j ( x ( t k ) , u ( t k ) , s ( t k ) ) = 0 , j = 1,2 , … , c (3.2) v j ( x ( t k ) , u ( t k ) , s ( t k ) ) ≤ 0 , j = 1,2 , … , l Eq. (2) is a discretized process model, where (2.1) is the state-space description with x(t k )∈ℜ n as the state vector, u(t k )∈ℜ m denotes the input vector, and s(t k )∈ℜ r the vector of given or possibly uncertain time-dependent parameters. Eq. (2.2) is a relationship between outputs and states. q j and v j are equality and inequality constraints with c and l dimensions respectively. Typical constraints covered by (3.2) are the process input constraints expressed as (4) u min ≤ u ( t k ) ≤ u max , Δ u min ≤ Δ u ( t k ) ≤ Δ u max and the process output constraints (5) y min ≤ y ( t k ) ≤ y max u min and u max are the lower and the upper bounds of the manipulated inputs, while Δu min and Δu max are the limits of the manipulated input increments. Constraints (4) are usually related with actuator saturation or rate-of-change restrictions, whereas constraints (5) are associated with operational limits (y min, y max) such as equipment specifications and safety considerations. The prediction horizon H p is the number of future time steps over which the prediction errors are minimized and the control horizon H c is the number of future time steps over which the control increments are minimized. u ( t k + 1 ) , u ( t k + 2 ) , … , u ( t k + H c ) are tentative values of the future control signal. The abundance of batch processes (as the crystallization) and continuous processes with wide operating ranges require nonlinear models for prediction, therefore functions f[.], h[.] and the constraints (3) are supposed to be nonlinear functions. A number of approaches have been developed to solve (1). Early in 1985, Ricker has shown that control system constraints can be handled by a combination of quadratic-programming (QP) and linear Internal Model Control (IMC) (Ricker, 1985). Later on, Lee and Ricker (1994) have solved the NMPC problem by local linear approximation of state/measurement equations computed at each sample time. The indirect (variational) approach, which is based on the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, is more adequate for problems without inequality constraints. On the other hand, the main direct methods, namely the sequential approach (also known as single shooting methods) and the simultaneous approach (multiple shooting methods) apply directly NLP solvers that are numerically expensive and often not feasible for on-line applications (Diehl et al., 2005). In the past few years research efforts were focused on adapting the off-line optimization methods for real time implementation (Zavala et al., 2008). The new algorithms propose several approximations of expensive operations as for example the second derivative Hessian matrix as a product of two Jacobian matrices, Riccati differential equations are substituted by linear expressions (Ohtsuka, 2004), or the set of constraints are approximated by an ellipsoid (Van Antwerp and Braatz, 2000), etc. The new optimal real time control solutions are feasible for industries with state-of-the-art control equipment. However, there are applications, as sugar crystallization, fermentation or precipitation processes, considered as non-high value industries, for which is still desirable to have the benefits of advanced control, but for which the time and expense of installing modern hardware is not justified. The heuristic modification proposed in the next section is particularly valuable for such type of processes. 3 Error tolerant MPC 3.1 Problem formulation We propose a modification of the general NMPC formulation (1), where the discretized optimization is performed based on the following performance index (6a) min [ u ( t k + 1 ) , u ( t k + 2 ) , … , u ( t k + H c ) ] J = λ 1 ∑ k = 1 H p ( e ( t k ) ) 2 + λ 2 ∑ k = 1 H c ( Δ u ( t k ) ) 2 , if E Σ > α , α ∈ R + , where (6b) E Σ = 1 H p ∑ k = 1 H p e ( t k ) subject to the same constraints (2)–(5). With this formulation the future control actions are calculated in the following way (7) u ( t k + 1 ) = u : min [ u ( t k + 1 ) , u ( t k + 2 ) , … , u ( t k + H c ) ] F = λ 1 ∑ k = 1 H p ( e ( t k ) ) 2 + λ 2 ∑ k = 1 H c ( Δ u ( t k ) ) 2 , if E Σ > α u * , if E Σ < α Eq. (6) is a particular form of the general performance index defined by (1). We denote it as an error tolerant (ET) MPC because the optimization is performed only when the error function E Σ is above a predefined real positive value α. When the error function is inside the α-strip the control action is equal to u *, the last implemented optimal control. The ETMPC modification is in the spirit of Ilchmann and Ryan (1994), where an adaptive controller is designed to regulate a bioreactor into a pre-specified small neighbourhood of a constant set-point reference. λ-Tracker (as the authors termed their method due to the λ-strip of error tolerance) was successfully applied in several biochemical reactors, namely continuous stirred tank bio-reactors and biological waste water treatment units. We extend this idea to the NMPC framework, for both constant and variable set-points. In all cases, the price to be paid is that the tracking is not achieved asymptotically, but in a neighborhood of the reference. However, the α tolerance can be arbitrarily small and is determined on a case by case basis, which suffices for practical purposes. The constrained optimization problem (6) and (7) can be solved using any standard optimization technique such as sequential quadratic programming (SQP). The benefit of the proposed approach, compared to the classical case, is that in the latter, when the optimization does not converge within the tolerance, a suboptimal control input is implemented, which still comes from the latest optimization. This may not lead to feasible control, whereas the approach proposed implements the last optimal control, u *. Note that the error function E Σ in (6b) is defined as the mean of the errors between the predicted outputs and their references along the next H p steps (the future errors). This choice is not unique. In a previous work (Paz Suárez et al., 2009c) the instantaneous error E Σ = r e f ( t k ) − y ( t k ) was used to enable the ETMPC. It speeded up the optimization, but made the algorithm more sensitive to short perturbations. Alternative definitions for E Σ can be also considered. 3.2 Selection of MPC parameters α is a design parameter whose choice is decisive for achieving a reasonable compromise between computational costs and tracking error. While a formal procedure for selecting α is not defined, the error tolerance is chosen based on common sense consideration of ±1% to ±5% error around the set-point. The choice of H p is related with the sampling period (Δt) of the digital control implementation, which in turn is a function of the settling time t s (the time before entering into the 5% around the set-point) of the closed loop system. As a rule of thumb, it is suggested Δt to be chosen at least 10 times smaller than t s (Soeterboek, 1992). Hence, the prediction horizon can be chosen according (8). (8) H p = I n t t Δ t It is known that the smaller the sampling time, the better is the reference trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. However, choosing a small sampling time yields a large prediction horizon. In order to compute the optimal control input, the optimization (6) is performed at each sampling time and requires large amount of computer memory per iteration and fast communication and computation resources. Such requirements are still unbearable for many industries with not-state-of-the-art control equipment. The ETMPC introduced by (6) has the potential to reduce the computational burden in such cases complementing other solutions in the literature for feasible real time optimal control. In the control tests, discussed in Section 6, the design parameter λ 1 is set to 1, while the choice of λ 1 is based on the following empirical expression: (9) u max − u min 2 ⋅ λ 2 = e max P 100 where P defines the desired contribution of the second term in (7) (0%≤ P ≤100%) and (10) e max = max ( ( r e f − y max ) 2 , ( r e f − y min ) 2 ) The intuition behind (9) and (10) is to make the two terms of (7) compatible and overcome the problem of different numerical ranges. This empirical choice of λ 2 appears to be complementary to the general criteria related with robustness and actuation cost aspects as for example in LQR. 4 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) predictive model ANN are computational structures characterized by the architecture (the network topology and pattern of connections between the nodes), the method of determining the connection weights and the activation functions that employ (Narendra and Parthasarathy, 1990). The ANN-based control can be approached in direct or indirect control framework. Direct neural control means that the controller itself is an ANN, while in the indirect neural control scheme, first an ANN is used to model the process to be controlled, and this model is then embedded in the controller. The implementation of the first approach is simple but its design and tuning are quite challenging. The second approach is chosen in the present work. Feedforward ANNs are usually used for dynamical system approximation because of its simplicity and well established techniques/software for training and simulation. However, ongoing research (Schaefer et al., 2008) suggests that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are more adequate to approximate dynamical relationships since they can encode past and current input–output information. Among a number of alternatives, RNN with global feedback was chosen (see Fig. 1 ), with a linear activation function located at the output layer (Layer 2 – purelin) and hyperbolic tangent functions located at the hidden layer (Layer 1 – tansig). Other activation functions can be also considered for the hidden nodes, however the symmetry of the hyperbolic tangent function into the interval (−1, 1) is often advantageous for functional approximation. The network input consists of two vectors formed by present and past network exogenous inputs (r) and past fed back network outputs (p), respectively. Note that the global feedback makes the RNN model similar to Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenios input (NARMAX) filters (Haykin, 1999). The mathematical structure of the RNN model is the following: (11) u N N = [ r , p ] ( complete network input ) (12) r = r 1 ( t k ) , … , r 1 ( t k − d ) , … , r c ( t k ) , … , r c ( t k − d ) ( network exogenous inputs ) (13) p = n 2 ( t k − 1 ) , … , n 2 ( t k − h ) ( recurrent network inputs ) (14) x = W 11 r + W 12 p + b 1 ( network states ) (15) n 1 = e x − e − x e x + e − x ( hidden layer output ) (16) n 2 = w 21 ⋅ n 1 + b 2 ( network output ) where W 11 ∈ℜ m×(c*(d+1)), W 12 ∈ℜ m×h , w 21 ∈ ℜ 1 × m , b 1 ∈ℜ m×1, b 2 ∈ℜ are the network weights (in matrix form) to be adjusted during the RNN training, m is the number of nodes in the hidden layer, d is the number of past exogenous input samples and h is the number of past network output samples fed back to the input. First the RNN models were extensively trained and validated off-line with real data from two industrial units representing fed-batch sugar crystallization multi stage processes and then the NMPC was executed on-line. In order to extract the underlying nonlinear process dynamics a preprocessing of the initial industrial data was performed. From the complete time series corresponding to the input signal of one stage only the portion that really excites the process output of the same stage is extracted. Hence, long periods of constant (steady-state) behavior are discarded. Since, the steady-state periods for normal operation are usually preceded by transient intervals, the data base constructed consists (in average) of 60–70% of transient period data. Due to the simultaneous spatial (network layers) and temporal (past values) aspects of the optimization, the static Backpropagation (BP) learning method was substituted by the Backpropagation through time (BPTT) learning (Haykin, 1999). Though the BPTT is a complex and costly training method, since the model has been designed off-line it does not bring realization problems. 5 Case study – sugar crystallization 5.1 Phases in process operation There are two basic types of sugar production: from cane sugar or from beet. The process considered in this work is of the first type and a typical industrial unit operation can be divided into the following sequential phases (Simoglou et al., 2005): Charging: During the first phase the pan is partially filled with a juice containing dissolved sucrose (termed liquor). The initial liquid charged in the pan corresponds approximately to 40% of the total vessel height. The charge is usually performed by complete opening of the feeding valve until the level sensor indicates 40%. Therefore, no special control policy is required at this stage. Concentration: The next phase is the concentration. The liquor is concentrated by evaporation, under vacuum, until the supersaturation reaches a predefined value. At this value seed crystals are introduced into the pan to start the production of crystals. This is the beginning of the crystallization phase. Crystallization (main phase): At this phase as evaporation takes place further liquor is added to the pan in order to guarantee crystal growth at a controlled supersaturation level and to increase the sugar content of the pan. Near to the end of this phase and for economical reasons, the liquor is replaced by other juice of lower purity (termed syrup). Tightening: The fourth phase consists of tightening which is principally controlled by evaporation capacity. The pan is filled with a suspension of sugar crystals in heavy syrup, which is dropped into a storage mixer. At the end of the batch, the massecuite undergoes centrifugation, where final refined sugar is separated from (mother) liquor that is recycled to the process. The different phases of the process are moved by distinct driving forces, therefore a sequence of four control loops was designed, as schematically represented in Fig. 2 . The transitions between the loops follow the operation strategy formulated in Table 1 . 5.2 Process simulator The process simulator employed throughout this work was developed within the group, in MATLAB environment. It is based in a general phenomenological model of the fed-batch crystallization process proposed by Georgieva et al. (2003), consisting of mass, energy and population balances as detailed in Appendix A. It was extensively tuned with real data from two industrial units (Sugar refinery RAR.SA, Portugal and Company 30 de Noviembre, Pinar del Río, Cuba). For all measured process variables (the vacuum pressure, brix and temperature of the feed flow, pressure and temperature of the steam), the simulator provides an option to introduce industrial measurements, which serves as a natural source of disturbance and noise. The results in the next section are related with the Sugar refinery RAR.SA plant unless otherwise stated. 6 Control design and tests 6.1 Controller design and implementation The operation strategy of four sequential control loops (Table 1) was implemented with five alternative control schemes (NMPC, ETMPC, RNN-MPC, RNN-ETMPC, PI) and comparatively tested on the process simulator. The control action is computed in a moving horizon framework, i.e., only u(t k+1) is implemented at the next sampling instant, and the optimization is repeated based on the updated information from the plant. In the simulations SQP optimization was implemented by fmincon subroutine of MATLAB optimization toolbox. At each major iteration, an approximation is made of the Hessian of the Lagrangian function using a quasi-Newton updating method. This is then used to generate a QP subproblem whose solution is used to form a search direction for a line search procedure. The QP solution involves two phases. The first phase is the calculation of a feasible point (if one exists). In case the QP subproblem is infeasible it indicates that the problem is highly nonlinear and that convergence might take longer than usual. The second phase involves the generation of an iterative sequence of feasible points that converge to the solution. In this method a set of active constrains is maintained (i.e., those that are on the constraint boundaries) at the solution point. More details for SQP can be found in Fletcher (1987). Within the controllers the process output predictions are provided either by a discretized state-space model (realized in Matlab) or by a RNN model (realized in the Neural Network Toolbox). In the control schemes where RNN predictive models were employed, for each process stage a distinct RNN model was designed, with corresponding architectures as summarized in Table 2 . All networks have one hidden layer, single input, single output and the number of the hidden layer neurons was determined during training with the Back Propagation algorithm. The RNN models were trained and validated with real industrial data. A number of regression models were obtained based on data of two, four or six in-spec batches. The RNN trained with six batches exhibits the best performance, therefore only results with this model are reported here. Fig. 3 depicts the validation of the sequence of four RNN models (for each control loop) over a complete process run using real data not used for network training (validation batches). 6.2 NMPC parameters (α, H p , H c ) The NMPC design parameters for each control loop are chosen according to the empirical considerations given in Section 3 and are summarized in Table 3 . α-Strip values were chosen as about 1% around the specified set points. The set-points correspond to the usual industrial referenced values. These may not be always the optimal values, however they maintain the transfer of saccharose from the massecuite to the crystals as high as possible. 6.3 Special case of on-line determined AM reference in the 4th loop The traditional practice of sugar production is a sequence of control loops where measurable variables are kept constant over a certain period. This intuitive strategy leads to simple error-correction based control, easy to implement and maintain. However, the controlled variables are often not the ones that directly determine the process performance, but the ones that are possible to measure. Meanwhile, advances in software sensor research (Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1993, 1994; Gonzaga et al., 2009) demonstrated that it is often plausible to estimate the unmeasurable variables that directly determine the process performance and take control corrections based on these estimations. We apply this concept for the average (in mass) crystal size AM in the last process stage. AM is the main sugar quality measure which is still not directly measurable. During normal plant operations, samples were periodically taken out over the 4th control loop and the evolution of the AM was off-line analyzed. Based only on the samples of qualified (referenced) batches a time varying reference for the crystal growth was deduced as the following empirical expression. (17) A M r e f ( k ) = ( 1 − γ ) ⋅ A M e n d _ r e f + γ ⋅ A M r e f ( k − 1 ) , γ ∈ 0,1 where AM end_ref is the reference for the crystal size at the batch end, for the particular case AM end_ref =0.56mm. γ belongs to the interval [0,1] and determines how smooth is the evolution curve. If γ =1, AM ref turns to be the desired final crystal size, while if γ =0 the reference is equal to the value computed at the previous step or to the initially defined AM ref (0). In a normal operation γ =0.9 is the value that provides the typical exponential curve depicted in Fig. 4 . At each iteration step, the AM reference is recomputed on-line, according to (17). 6.4 PID controllers The various MPC schemes are also compared with the classical PID control strategy. The velocity form of the PID controller is (18) u ( t + k ) = u ( t + k − 1 ) + K p ( e ( t + k ) − e ( t + k − 1 ) ) + Δ t τ i ⋅ e ( t + k ) + τ d Δ t ⋅ ( e ( t + k ) − 2 ⋅ e ( t + k − 1 ) + e ( t + k − 2 ) ) with the parameters k p , τ i , τ d tuned, using the ITAE (integral of the time weighted absolute error) criteria for tracking (Aström and Hägglund, 1995). I T A E = ∫ 0 ∞ t y ( t ) − y r e f ( t ) d t . For each parameter an interval of possible values was defined based on empirical knowledge and process operator expertise. The optimized parameters of the sequence of four PID controllers are summarized in Table 4 . Note that in all loops the tuning suggested PI controllers therefore the derivative time constant is zero. 6.5 Discussion of results The results of this work are summarized in Figs. 5–13 and reflect the main aspects of our study, computational spects, tracking performance and end point product quality. 6.5.1 Computational time reduction Figs. 5–8 depict the computational time per iteration over a complete batch, comparing the classical NMPC with performance index (1) and the Error Tolerant MPC (ETMPC) with performance index (6). Fig. 5 shows the case where the NMPC and the ETMPC are implemented with discretized nonlinear state-space predictive models. Fig. 6 depicts the computational times when the same type of controllers (NMPC and ETMPC) employ RNN predictive models (RNN-NMPC and RNN-ETMPC) and finally Figs. 7 and 8 compare the RNN-MPC and the RNN-ETMPC for the special case of variable AM reference in the 4th loop. Process simulators of two sugar plants are considered: Sugar refinery RAR.SA, Portugal (Fig. 7) and Company 30 de Noviembre, Pinar del Río, Cuba (Fig. 8). In all cases the ETMPC requires less time to compute the control action. The average CPU times per iteration over three batches are presented in Table 5 (last line of each table). Note that they range from about 0.166s for the classical NMPC to 0.061–0.078s for the RNN-ETMPC, assuming only 1% error tolerance. In case the process tolerates higher tracking imprecision the computational time can be further reduced. The results presented in Table 5 suggest also that the substitution of the first principles model by a RNN reduces additionally the CPU time/per iteration. The maximum values (hard constraints) of critical process variables are resumed in Table 6 . Note that during the last few minutes of the 3rd control loop (Fig. 11) the steam flowrate reaches its max value and this is an example of suboptimal control. Many authors have studied the computational aspects of real time NMPCs and proposed efficient techniques to make the optimization feasible. The optimization time reduction achieved in this work does not compete with them, instead it can complement the other techniques and introduce additional benefits in those cases where the optimization does not converge but the tracking error is below a certain threshold. 6.5.2 Set-point tracking Time trajectories of the controlled and the manipulated variables for each of the four control loops simulated over one in-spec batch (Batch 1) are depicted in Figs. 9–13, respectively. While the NMPC and PI controlled variables strictly follow the respective set points, ETMPC enables more variations inside the allowed α-strip. Similar results were obtained for other referenced batches. Though the figures suggest that the PI controlled process is better able to track a reference, the batch has typically longer duration (see Figs. 12 and 13), which leads to higher production costs and energy consumption. Remark: Fig. 12 depicts the 4th control loop (crystallization with syrup), see Table 1, where the volume fraction of crystals ( w c ) is kept around 0.43. This stage ends when the volume reaches its maximum value (30m3). The feed valve is closed (F f goes to zero) and then starts the last crystallization stage – tightening. Over this stage the steam valve is closed, w c naturally increases, when the stirrer power reaches the maximum value of 50A (hard constraint), the stirrer and the barometric condenser are stopped, the batch process is over. 6.5.3 Final product quality The quality of the produced sugar is evaluated only after the process is finished and is quantified by the final values of AM and CV. The quality measures of three batches applying all scenarios studied are summarized in Table 5. The NMPC and ETMPC strategies outperform the PI control. The interpretation of this result is that MPC takes into consideration the process future and therefore it is able to achieve better end point product quality. Note that both the NMPC and ETMPC strategies for the scenario with variable AM reference in the 4th loop end up with an average crystal size very close to the desired value (specification 0.56mm) and the lowest crystal size variation (CV%). This is also confirmed by Fig. 13. The intuition behind is that in case a reliable estimation of a key process variable is provided it would be favorable to control it instead of controlling a measurable but less critical process variable. 7 Concluding remarks The aim of this study was to carry out nonlinear model based control of a multiple stages fed-batch sugar crystallization using the combined concepts of RNNs (for predictive modeling) and NMPC (for control). A heuristic modification of the NMPC is proposed (termed ETMPC) where the optimization is executed only when the tracking error is above a predefined level. An operation strategy with a sequence of four control loops, driven by individual ETMPC controllers, is formulated and compared with traditionally applied PI control schemes and the classical MPC. Scenarios with two control policies (constant or variable reference) and two predictive models (analytical nonlinear state-space model or a RNN input–output model) were analyzed. The results demonstrate that both NMPC and ETMPC controllers lead to improved end point process specifications (AM and CV), when compared with the PI controller. Particularly, in the case of variable reference for AM (in the last loop), there is a tendency of getting final crystals with very uniform size distribution. It is well known that the PI controller is well suited for constant set-point tracking, yet, the specific (end point) requirements of the fed-batch sugar production favor more advanced solutions. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the optimization time per iteration is reduced, when employing ETMPC, and additionally relaxed when implementing a data-based predictive model (the control scheme RNN-ETMPC). In the presence of limited computational resources suboptimal control is often the compromise due to feasibility problems or lack of solution (convergence) within the restricted time per iteration. With ETMPC such problems can happen less frequently and affect milder the overall system performance. From a systems engineering point of view, the multi-stage fed-batch process considered in this work can be found, with due adaptations, in a significant number of industrial processes. Therefore, the control solution proposed for the present industrial case has the potential to be further extended and applied to other processes.

Appendix A Crystallization model Sugar crystallization occurs through the mechanisms of nucleation, growth and agglomeration. The general phenomenological model of the fed-batch crystallization process consists of mass, energy and population balances, including the relevant kinetic rates for nucleation, linear growth and agglomeration (Ilchmann and Ryan, 1994). While the mass and energy balances are common expressions in many chemical process models, the population balance is related with the crystallization phenomenon, which is still an open modeling problem. A.1 Mass balance The mass of all participating solid and dissolved substances is included in a set of conservation mass balance equations: (A1) M ˙ = f 1 ( M ( t ) , F ( t ) , S 1 ( t ) ) , t 0 ≤ t ≤ t , f M ( 0 ) = M 0 where M(t)∈ℜ q and F(t)∈ℜ m are the mass and the flow rate vectors, with q and m dimensions respectively, and t f is the final batch time. S 1(t)∈ℜ r1 is the vector of physical time dependent parameters as density, viscosity, purity, etc. For the process in hand, the detailed form of the macro-model (A1) is as follows (A1-1) M s o l = M a + M i + M w (A1-2) M m = M s o l + M c (A1-3) d M w d t = F f ρ f ( 1 − B f ) + F w ρ w − J v a p (A1-4) d M i d t = F f ⋅ ρ f ⋅ B f ⋅ ( 1 − P u r f ) (A1-5) d M a d t = F f ⋅ ρ f ⋅ B f ⋅ P u r f − J c r i s (A1-6) d M c d t = J c r i s (A1-7) V m = M c + M s o l ρ s o l (A1-8) J v a p = W + Q λ v a p + K v a p ⋅ ( T m − T w ( v a c ) − B P E ) A.2 Energy balance The general energy balance model is (A2) d T m d t = a J c r i s + b F f + c J v a p + d where parameters a, b, c and d incorporate the enthalpy terms and specific heat capacities derived as time dependent functions of physical and thermodynamic properties as follows (A2-1) a = H s o l − H c + ( 1 − B s o l ) ( d H s o l / d B s o l ) + ( ( 1 − P u r s o l ) / B s o l ) ⋅ ( d H s o l / d P u r s o l ) M s o l ⋅ C p s o l + M c ⋅ C p c (A2-2) b = ρ f ( H f − H s o l + ( B f − B s o l ) ( d H s o l / d B s o l ) + ( ( B f ( P u r f − P u r s o l ) ) / B s o l ) ⋅ ( d H s o l / d P u r s o l ) ) M s o l ⋅ C p s o l + M c ⋅ C p c (A2-3) c = H s o l − H v a p − B s o l ⋅ ( d H s o l / d B s o l ) M s o l ⋅ C p s o l + M c ⋅ C p c (A2-4) d = W + Q + F w ρ w ( H w − H s o l + B s o l ) ( d H s o l / d B s o l ) M s o l ⋅ C p s o l + M c ⋅ C p c (A2-5) d H s o l d B s o l = − 29.7 T m + 4.6 P u r s o l T m + 0.075 T m 2 (A2-6) d H s o l d P u r s o l = 4.61 B x s o l T m A.3 Population balance Mathematical representation of the crystallization rate can be achieved through basic mass transfer considerations or by writing a population balance represented by its moment equations. Employing a population balance is generally preferred since it allows to take into account initial experimental distributions and, most significantly, to consider complex mechanisms such as those of size dispersion and/or particle agglomeration/aggregation.

This review provides a general idea about the main practical and research lines in dairy process control. It summarizes the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller as a control engineering practice that has been established for decades, various statistical process control (SPC) techniques widely implemented in batch and fed-batch dairy plants, and recent intelligent control (IC) alternatives. Fuzzy logic control systems (FLCSs) and artificial neural network (ANN)-based model predictive control (MPC) are the main IC paradigms described.",

Our study revealed that the duration of the VEPs required for a reliable identification is crucial for real time implementation of the proposed biometry paradigm. A post processing procedure is formulated in order to overcome the problem of static classification. Our ultimate goal is not to compete with the conventional biometry (such as fingerprint, iris or palm recognition systems) but to design a VEP -based biometry modality as a supplement (\"a second opinion\") in clinical conditions.

A theoretical framework for estimation of process kinetic rates based on different temporal (time accounting) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures is introduced. Three ANNs that explicitly consider temporal aspects of modeling are exemplified: i) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with global feedback (from the network output to the network input); ii) Time Lagged Feedforward Neural Network (TLFN) and iii) Reservoir Computing Network (RCN). Crystallization growth rate estimation is the benchmark for testing the methodology. The proposed hybrid (dynamical ANN & analytical submodel) schemes are promising modeling framework when the process is strongly nonlinear and particularly when input-output data is the only information available. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

On one hand, we propose a modification of the general Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach where a prespecified tracking error is tolerated. The introduction of error tolerance (ET) in the MPC optimization algorithm reduces considerably the average duration of each optimization step and makes the MPC computationally more efficient and attractive for industrial applications. On the other hand a challenging scheduled crystallization process serves as a case study to show the practical relevance of the new intelligent predictive control. Comparative tests with different control policies are performed: i) Classical MPC with analytical or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) process model; ii) ET MPC with analytical or ANN process model; iii) Proportional-Integral (PI) control. Besides the computational benefits of ET MPC, the integration of ANN into the ET MPC brings substantial improvements of the final process performance measures and further relaxes the computational demands. © 2009 IEEE.",

The combination of ANN and MPC usually leads to computationally very demanding procedure, that finally makes this approach less popular or even impossible to apply for real time industrial applications. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an error tolerance in the MPC optimization algorithm that reduces considerably the computational costs. Besides, the new ANN- MPC framework proved to bring substantial improvements compared with traditional Proportional-Integral (PI) control with respect to macro process performance measures as less energy consumption and higher productivity. © 2009 IEEE.",

The two scenarios are successfully tested for two benchmark problems, estimation of the precipitation rate of calcium phosphate and estimation of sugar crystallization growth rate. In the second part of the chapter the developed ANN-based models are integrated into the structure of a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC).

In this paper we consider an extension of the NMF algorithm which provides unique solutions whenever the underlying component signals are sufficiently sparse. A new sparseness measure is proposed most appropriate to suitably transformed gene expression profiles. The resulting fitness function is discontinuous and exhibits many local minima, hence we use a genetic algorithm for its optimization.

From academic point of view the aim is to build a dynamical macro model to fit the material balance and explain the main kinetic mechanisms that govern the transformation of the hydroxyapatite (HAP) into brushite and the growth of brushite, based on laboratory experiments and collected database. From practical point of view, the aim is to design a reliable process simulator that can be easily imbedded in industrial software for model driven monitoring, optimization and control purposes. Based upon a databank of laboratory measurements of the calcium concentration in solution (on-line) and the particle size distribution (off-line) a reliable dynamical model of the dual nature of brushite particle formation for a range of initial concentrations of the reagents was derived as a system of ordinary differential equations of time. The performance of the model is tested with respect to the predicted evolution of mass of calcium in solution and the average (in mass) particle size along time. Results obtained demonstrate a good agreement between the model time trajectories and the available experimental data for a number of different initial concentrations of reagents. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

From academic point of view the aim is to build a dynamical macro model to fit the material balance and explain the main kinetic mechanisms that govern the transformation of the hydroxyapatite (HAP) into brushite and the growth of brushite, based on laboratory experiments and collected database. From practical point of view, the aim is to design a reliable process simulator that can be easily imbedded in industrial software for model driven monitoring, optimization and control purposes. Based upon a databank of laboratory measurements of the calcium concentration in solution (on-line) and the particle size distribution (off-line) a reliable dynamical model of the dual nature of brushite particle formation for a range of initial concentrations of the reagents was derived as a system of ordinary differential equations of time. The performance of the model is tested with respect to the predicted evolution of mass of calcium in solution and the average (in mass) particle size along time. Results obtained demonstrate a good agreement between the model time trajectories and the available experimental data for a number of different initial concentrations of reagents. Keywords A1.

Depending on the temperature, the level of supersaturation, pH and initial concentration of reagents, one can obtain different calcium phosphate phases. One of them is the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) known also as brushite. DCPD is recognized as an important product in the application of fertilizers to soil and is studied mainly for its role in the physiological formation of calcium phosphates. For the present investigation, the precipitation of DCPD was performed in a batch laboratory crystallizer. The precipitation was carried out by mixing equimolar quantities of calcium hydroxide suspension and orthophosphoric acid solution. Five successive stages were repeatedly identified during a number of experiments performed with different initial reagent concentrations and each of them lasting for about 3h [3]: (i) spontaneous precipitation of hydroxyapatite (HAP); (ii) complete dissolution of calcium and HAP growth; (iii) appearance of first nuclei of brushite; (iv) coexistence of HAP and brushite and (v) transformation of HAP into brushite and growth of brushite. A simulation model representing the above stages of the process is of particular interest for the chemical industry and for understanding the calcium phosphate formation mechanisms. However, getting a unified dynamical model describing all identified process stages is still an open problem. The practical approach adopted in this research was to look for reliable mathematical approximations of the individual stages. Among them, modelling of the last stage is the most challenging issue because it has to represent simultaneously two kinetics phenomena. Brushite grows due to direct consumption of calcium in the solution and due to the transformation of HAP into brushite. The transformation of HAP into brushite would not be expected since HAP is thermodynamically the most stable species. Nevertheless, at this stage HAP appears to be in a low-crystallinity state and in metastable equilibrium with brushite which provokes the transformation. In this paper, a dynamical analytical model with respect to the last stage is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous publications considering the issue of modelling the dual nature of brushite particle formation. In many previous works on growth kinetics of DCPD crystals as for example in Marshall and Nancollas [4], Hohl et al. [5] and Heughebaert et al. [6] the same process is studied in seeded solutions. Such a scenario impedes spontaneous nucleation and growth, which is in contrast to the study considered in this paper. The present work is based on several contributions in different fields. Modelling of the general crystallization kinetics has been established by Randolph and Larson [7]. Kinetic parameter estimation based on the moment analysis techniques has been studied by Tavare and Garside [8]. The mechanisms that govern the formation of brushite were thoroughly investigated in a previous work by the authors (see Ref. [3]). In that paper, the experimental proofs for the identification of five distinct stages that explain the complete transformation into brushite, were reported. Models that combine analytical and data-driven approach to approximate the batch crystallization phenomenon have been developed in Ref. [9] (see also the contribution by Simoglou et al. [10]). The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the experimental procedure of brushite precipitation is briefly discussed. In Section 3 a mathematical model of the process is introduced and the main theoretical motivations are stated. Section 4 contains details on the optimization procedure for model fitting. Finally, in Section 5 the theoretical model is evaluated by simulations and the results for optimization and validation data are illustrated. 2 Experimental procedure Experiments [3,11] were performed in a batch reactive crystallization cylindrical tank made of glass, with 100mm in diameter and 250mm in height, and a glass stirrer operated at 270rpm. Temperature was regulated by a water jacket and a thermostat bath maintained at 25°C. The reactive crystallization of brushite was carried out by mixing equal volumes, 0.5dm3, of calcium hydroxide (Riedel–de Haën, 96%, 31219) aqueous suspension and orthophosphoric acid (Pronalab, 85%) aqueous solution with the same molar concentration. Ultra-pure water was used. The experiment began by quickly adding the calcium hydroxide suspension to the orthophosphoric acid solution. The concentration of reagents, before mixing, varied from 0.05 to 0.4M. The calcium concentration, pH, temperature and conductivity were continuously measured (inoLab pH/Cond Level 3, WTW) and recorded by a computer for about 3h. Suspension samples were withdrawn at different time intervals, filtered, dried and analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and characterized by X-ray diffraction. The calcium was analyzed using a selective electrode (WTW-D82362 Weitheim), and pH was measured by an electrode WTW Sentix 6. X-ray diffraction was made with a Philips PW1830 diffractometer using the CoKα radiation ( λ CoK α = 0.1789 nm ) . The particle size distribution is periodically determined by laser light diffraction (with a Coulter laser particle granulometer). As a result, a database with the evolution of the particle size distribution along time was recorded. Table 1 summarizes partially the data for the average (in mass) particle size (AM) and the time of probes for two initial concentrations (0.05 and 0.4M). 3 Dynamical model The evolution in time of the overall process of DCPD precipitation is governed by distinct driving forces. Therefore, attempts to represent all phases by a common model do seem not relevant. In a previous work [3] all experimentally identified phases were thoroughly discussed and the process evolution (along 3h) was divided into five stages: (1) In the overall process of DCPD precipitation the first compound to be formed is HAP. In this first stage there is an equilibrium between HAP precipitated and HAP in solution. The HAP growth and pH stabilization are essentially due to the consumption of calcium not yet dissolved into the solution. (2) The calcium is completely dissolved, and consequently the HAP growth is responsible for the pH decrease. (3) As pH changes the first nuclei of brushite appear. (4) Two species, brushite and HAP, coexist in the solution. (5) Brushite becomes the most stable species in the solution and a transformation of HAP into brushite occurs. Brushite growth is stabilized. In the last stage of the process, a slow increase in pH and a decrease in calcium concentration was observed. SEM and X-ray diffraction analyses showed a gradual reduction of HAP crystals simultaneously with the growth of brushite crystals, until the complete HAP disappearance. This happens because HAP is in a low crystallinity state and in metastable equilibrium with brushite. Since the brushite crystallization rate is much higher than the HAP crystallization rate, the kinetics factors have a crucial role leading to the gradual HAP disappearing and brushite formation. Consequently, the HAP-brushite transformation leads to pH increase. Fig. 1 [3] refers to three different moments of this stage. The HAP disappearance and the consequent increase in brushite crystallinity are clearly visible. The experiments confirmed that brushite particles grow due to the calcium consumption in the solution and due to a transformation of HAP into brushite. This dual kinetic nature of brushite precipitation constitutes the main modelling challenge. Since the transformation from HAP into brushite is a chemical reaction, which has a lot of influence on the composition of the solution, the speciation of the solution was explicitly taken into account during the process study (see Appendix A). This was made by solving a system of equilibrium and mass balance equations and from the measurements of calcium concentration and pH [11]. The system describes the chemical species present in the solution, and the change of their concentrations along time. Based on this system, presented in more details in Appendix A, the composition of the precipitate was also determined and the mass conservation equation (2) of the model that follows was extracted. The model is conceptually obtained by writing the appropriate mass balances with a mathematical representation of the precipitation rate. The latter can be achieved applying basic mass transfer considerations [12] or by writing a population balance represented by its moment equations [13,14]. At first glance the method of population balance seems not quite typical to describe HAP–brushite transformation mainly because it assumes the presence or the introduction of seeds to induce the particle growth. However, based on the available images showing brushite appearance on the surface of HAP crystals, the existing HAP particles at the beginning of the fifth phase can be interpreted as seeds for brushite formation. Furthermore, the method of population balance represented by its moments was preferred since it allows taking into account initial experimental distributions for which data are available. Process modelling involves the following assumptions: (i) the suspension is well mixed in the whole tank volume; (ii) the suspension volume is constant during the precipitation process. 3.1 Mass balances The following set of conservation mass balance Eqs. (1)–(4) includes mass of calcium in solution (M c), mass of HAP particles (M HAP), mass of brushite particles (M B), with respective molar weight ratios ( q m 1 , q m 2 ) : (1) d M c d t = - q m 1 J crys , (2) d M HAP d t = - K HAP ( M HAP ) 2 , (3) d M B d t = J crys + 10 q m 2 K HAP ( M HAP ) 2 , (4) q m 1 = m m c m m B , q m 2 = m m B m m HAP . In Eq. (2), M HAP is determined as a monotonically decreasing function, which corresponds to the experimentally observed HAP dynamical behavior. K HAP is one of the model fitting parameters. The second order was chosen after an optimization procedure to get qualitative curve fitting of the available measurements for all initial concentrations. Based on system (A.1) presented in Appendix A, the available measurements and the given initial concentrations of calcium and phosphates, the concentration of all chemical species in solution were determined and then used to calculate the mass and composition of precipitate along time, more particularly Eqs. (2) and (3). HAP is the first precipitate to be formed and during the last stage all HAP particles gradually transform into brushite particles according to the following reaction equation: Ca 10 ( OH ) 2 ( PO 4 ) 6 + 4 H 3 PO 4 + 18 H 2 O → 10 CaHPO 4 · 2 H 2 O . The transformation of HAP into brushite was quantified by calculating the calcium to phosphate molar ratio (R=Ca/P) in the precipitate. Initially this ratio was equal to 1.67 (which means only HAP is present) and along time as HAP transforms into brushite the ratio decreases monotonically until it reaches the value of 1 (all HAP is transformed into brushite). The number of particles during this (last) stage of transformation was estimated by the particle size distribution periodic measurements and the calculated mass of precipitate. It was practically constant along the stage. This is the first phenomenon modelled by Eq. (3), mathematically expressed by the right-hand term 10 q m 2 K HAP ( M HAP ) 2 . Based on the measurements it was further observed that the solution is supersaturated relatively to brushite and the calcium concentration decreases along the time, which means brushite particles grow from solution. This is the second phenomenon modelled in Eq. (3) and expressed by the term J crys. In summary, Eq. (3) follows from the speciation relations given in Appendix A and more particularly from the concentrations of the different chemical species in solutions (measured as the calcium, or determined from the system of equations (A.1)). In this way Eq. (3) reflects the dual nature of brushite mass balance. On one hand, brushite mass increases due to direct consumption of calcium in the solution (J crys is proportional to −dM c/dt) and on the other hand more brushite is formed due to HAP–brushite transformation ( K HAP ( M HAP ) 2 is proportional to HAP mass decrease−dM HAP/dt). 3.2 Population balance The difficulty in precipitation modelling is essentially due to the accurate description of the kinetics involved [15,16]. This particular kinetics model involves some simplifying assumptions experimentally confirmed by periodical laser light diffraction measurements: (i) during the last phase of DCPD precipitation the number of crystals does not change significantly; (ii) growth rate is independent of the crystal size; (iii) agglomeration and breakage phenomena are negligible and therefore were not considered for modelling. Before analysis by SEM and X-ray diffraction the suspension samples are filtered and dried. During the filtration process the particles tend to aggregate. Therefore, the SEM images in Fig. 1 show the particles as if they were agglomerated. In fact they are only aggregated and are afterwards easily dispersed in an ultra-sonic bath performed before the size measurements in the laser granulometer. The assumption (iii) is based on the laser measurements which confirm the lack of particle agglomeration. For the evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) the approach of Ref. [7] is adopted and the population balance is determined in terms of the number–size density function n(L) (5) ∂ n ( L ) ∂ t + ∂ ( Gn ( L ) ) ∂ L = 0 . Following the theory of Randolph and Larson [7], the partial differential equation (5) is conveniently replaced by the method of moments where each moment of the number–size distribution n(L) is mathematically defined as (6) μ j ( L ) = ∫ 0 ∞ L j n ( L ) d L , j = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , … . The PSD evolution is recovered based on the first five moments determined by the following set of ordinary differential equations (ODE): (7) d μ 0 d t = 0 , (8) d μ 1 d t = G μ 0 , (9) d μ 2 d t = 2 G μ 1 , (10) d μ 3 d t = 3 G μ 2 , (11) d μ 4 d t = 4 G μ 3 . Eq. (7) reflects the assumption for lack of secondary nucleation. The zero moment (μ 0), which represents the number of crystals is assumed constant. This statement is experimentally grounded because PSD, periodically determined by laser light diffraction (Coulter Counter), confirmed that the number of the crystals did not change significantly. The process nonlinearity is included in the precipitation rate J crys, which is a function of the population balance as follows: (12) J crys = 3 ρ B k v B G μ 2 . 3.2.1 Brushite particle growth due to consumption of calcium in solution (path 1) The kinetics of the brushite particle growth due to consumption of the calcium into solution is described by the linear growth rate (G) (13) G = k a R g 3 ρ B k v B , where R g is the specific growth rate, defined as a second-order function of the relative supersaturation (14) R g = K g ( C - C * C * ) 2 K g is one of the model fitting parameters. Remark In some publications (see Ref. [17]), for solutions of sparingly soluble salt such as HAP and DCPC, the crystallization driving force is expressed as a Gibbs free energy of transfer from supersaturated to saturated solution for a given solute. However, the supersaturation expression C−C*/C* in Eq. (14) is also relevant as for example in Sohnel and Mullin [18] where the expression ([Ca]–[Ca]eq) is used as the driving force for the precipitation of calcium carbonate. 3.2.2 Brushite particle growth due to the HAP–brushite transformation (path 2) Invoking general relations between the mass (m), the volume (V) and the linear size (L) of a particle m = ρ V , V = k v L 3 the expression for L can be rearranged as (15a) L = ( m ρ k v ) 1 / 3 . Following (15a), the linear size of a HAP particle (L HAP) and of a brushite particle (L B) that correspond to a certain quantity of mass m is (15b) L HAP = ( m ρ HAP k v HAP ) 1 / 3 , L B = ( m ρ B k v B ) 1 / 3 , L HAP ≠ L B . From (15b), L B can be determined as a function of L HAP as follows: (16) L B = ( ρ HAP k v HAP ρ B k v B ) 1 / 3 L HAP = k L L HAP , where (17) k L = ( ρ HAP k v HAP ρ B k v B ) 1 / 3 = 1.4205 . The physical interpretation of Eqs. (16) and (17), from a mass balance point of view, is that the transformation of a certain quantity of HAP species into the same quantity of brushite species results into an enlargement of the linear particle size quantified by the parameter kL . Obviously, the reason behind this is the different densities of the two species. So far, the growth of brushite due to the two precipitation phenomena is analytically formulated implementing different mathematical approaches, path 1 is represented by the linear growth rate (13) and path 2 is accounted by the linear particle size (16). A possible way to explain simultaneously the two precipitation paths goes through the concept of the average (in mass) particle size (AM). Moreover, data for AM is available by the periodical laser light diffraction measurements. According to Randolph and Larson [7], AM can be determined as a function of the leading moments as follows: (18) AM = μ 4 / μ 3 . Expression (18) accounts for the brushite growth only due to consumption of calcium in the solution. Numerical simulations of the model with AM calculated by (18) show clearly a discrepancy between the experimental and simulated particle size distribution. The particle growth due to the HAP–brushite transformation as discussed in Eq. (16) needs also to be considered. To handle the problem we introduce in Eq. (18) a proportional factor (P) which is a function of kL , in the form (19) AM = P ( k L ) μ 4 μ 3 . To find a suitable P(kL ), an alternative form of computing the average (in mass) particle size is invoked (see Ref. [19]) (20) AM = ∑ i = 1 p L i M i ∑ i = 1 p M i , where p is the number of different particle sizes in the assumed PSD, termed also as classes, Mi and Li are the total mass and the respective particle size of class i. At each moment of the HAP–brushite transformation process, HAP and brushite particles coexist. Therefore, in order to obey the mass balance principle, the expression LiMi in Eq. (20) must be expressed as a sum of two terms corresponding to the respective portion of each species (21) L i M i = L B i M B i + L HAP i M HAP i . Assuming Eq. (16) for each class it follows: (22) L B i = k L L HAP i . Taking into account Eqs. (21)–(22), Eq. (20) is modified as (23) AM = ∑ i = 1 p L HAP i ( k L M B i + M HAP i ) ∑ i = 1 p ( M B i + M HAP i ) . To get an expression for AM that describes the dual nature of brushite particle growth and considering Eqs. (19) and (23), the following proportional factor was selected: (24) P ( k L ) = k L M B + M HAP M B + M HAP . Expression (24) was obtained as a first-order approximation of the integral of Eq. (23). 4 Parameter fitting The parameters, K HAP and K g, are fitted with data set obtained by a number of experiments with two different initial concentrations of reagents (0.2 and 0.3M), following a classical non-linear regression. Each iteration of the optimization procedure includes the integration along time of balance Eqs. (1)–(3) and (7)–(11) for each of the experiments, with the required resetting of initial conditions for each run. The optimization is carried out in a batch mode, where the tuning parameters are updated only after complete processing of the whole data set and related computing of the performance function. 4.1 Performance function The collected measurements of calcium concentration (on-line) and AM (off-line analysis) along time are the principal indicators for evaluation of the model quality. Therefore, both of them are integrated into the performance function. For each discrete time point k, the mass of calcium in the solution ( M c mod ) k computed by Eq. (1) is compared with the available data ( M c data ) k to determine the first error term of the performance function. For numerical reasons, its normalized form is preferred as follows: (25) E k Ca = | ( M c data ) k - ( M c mod ) k | ( M c data ) k . The error between the model predictions (23) of ( AM k mod ) and the data ( AM k data ) for the average (in mass) particle size forms the second term of the performance function The respective normalized form is (26) E k AM = | AM k data - AM k mod | AM k data . Note that the available data points for the trajectory of AM along time are much less than the values computed by the model. 40–60 AM data points correspond to the number of repetitions of the same experiment while 1600 (in average) AM model points correspond to the discretization time. In order to complete the data set with extra points required by Eq. (26), a theoretical curve was generated applying cubic spline interpolation on the initial data set. Finally, the performance function to be minimized has the following structure: (27) J = ∑ j = 1 N exp ∑ k = 1 N points [ r 1 ( E k Ca ) j + r 2 ( E k AM ) j ] , where r 1 and r 2 are factors that determine the priority of each term. For the present study both terms are considered as equally important and r 1=r 2=0.5. Data from 6 repeating experiments with initial concentration of reagents 0.2M and the same number of experiments with initial concentration of reagents 0.3M were utilized for minimization of Eq. (27), hence N exp=12 and N points≈1600. 4.2 Optimization scenario The optimization procedure can be mathematically formulated as (28) min K HAP ∈ X , K g ∈ Y J . The objective is to find the parameters K HAP∈X and K g∈Y known also as the decision variables that locally minimize (27). X and Y are closed intervals in R, which define the parameter sub-plane over which the optimal values are searched. The optimization procedure was performed in Matlab programming environment, with implementation of Optimization toolbox routines. The fourth order Runge–Kutta routine with variable step size was used for integration of the model Eqs. (1)–(3) and (7)–(11) and the simplex direct search method for the parameter adaptation. Due to the inherent stiffness of the model equations, numerical problems might appear. To overcome them and also to improve the convergence of the procedure a good choice of the initial values for K HAP and K g was required. Therefore, prior to the main two-dimensional optimization stage (28), a one-dimensional preliminary optimization was repeatedly performed. One of the parameters was fixed and the other served as a scalar local minimizer of Eq. (27) and then vice versa. The effectiveness of this preliminary step cannot be analytically proved, however it was observed that starting the main optimization stage with initial values of K HAP and K g determined by the individual parameter optimization speeded up the convergence. 4.3 Initial conditions The initial conditions for the numerical simulations are summarized in Table 2 . Recorded data are with respect to the overall precipitation process. However, since the objective of this work is to develop a model only for the transformation of HAP into brushite and growth of brushite, the simulations start at the beginning of the fifth stage. In order to get the initial values required for the integration of Eqs. (1)–(3), the initial time t ini of the last process stage need to be extracted. The time point where pH starts slowly to increase and the calcium concentration starts slowly to decrease is assigned as an indicator for the beginning of the last stage. Once t ini is determined, the initial values of the process states, M c(t ini), M HAP(t ini) and M B(t ini), are easily extracted from the data set. For the integration of the population balance Eqs. (7)–(11), the initial conditions of the leading moments are also required. To recover them, the general definition of the j moment of the number–size distribution is involved (29) μ j ( L ) = ∫ 0 ∞ L j n ( L ) d L . The first-order approximation of Eq. (29) is (30) μ j ( L ) = ∑ i = 1 p ( L i mean ) j n i ( L ) Δ L i , where Δ L i = | L i + 1 - L i | and L i mean = ( L i + 1 + L i ) / 2 . The particles are distributed into p different sizes and for the case considered p=16. The periodical measurements by the Coulter laser particle granulometer provide data for ni (L)and (Li ), thus the μj (t ini) are straightforward recovered applying Eq. (30). The final values of the optimized parameters and the values of constant parameters are summarized in Table 3 . 5 Results and discussion The analytical model introduced in Section 3 is evaluated for its ability to predict process behavior for various initial concentrations of reagents (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4M). The results are summarized in Figs. 2 and 3 . Data for the main system states (M c, M HAP and M B) are denoted by dashed line in all figures on subplots (a), (c) and (d), respectively. Data for AM is denoted by stars in all subplots (b). The model time trajectories of M c (subplots (a)) and AM (subplots (b)) are direct indicators of the model quality since measurements for them are available. The mass of HAP and brushite are not directly measured variables but they can be inferred by the available measurements. Thus, the plots of M HAP (subplots (c)) and M B (subplots (d)) are indirect indicators of the model reliability. Data from experiments with initial concentrations of reagents 0.2 and 0.3M were used in Section 4 to optimize the model parameters, therefore it is not surprising that all model variables (M c, M HAP, M B, AM) closely match the data from these two types of experiments (see Fig. 2). However, more valuable are the results depicted in Fig. 3 where the model was tested on new ‘unseen’ validation data corresponding to experiments with different initial concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.4M). Data and model trajectories match quite well which confirms the ability of the dynamical first principles model discussed in this work to simulate the physical phenomena of simultaneously HAP transformation into brushite and growth of brushite. Remark. Variation of initial concentrations of the reagents results in changing the initial time of the last process stage (t ini). Lower the concentration, later the beginning of HAP–brushite transformation. 6 Conclusions A general dynamical model of the precipitation of dicalcium phosphate dehydrate is presented in this paper. The objective was to define a reliable model to explain the last stage of the overall precipitation process, namely the transformation of hydroxyapatite into DCPD (named as brushite) and the growth of brushite. Based upon a databank of laboratory measurements of the calcium concentration in the solution (on-line) and the particle size distribution (off-line) a dynamical model of the process for a range of initial concentrations of the reagents was derived as a system of ordinary differential equations of time. The performance of the model is examined with respect to prediction quality of the time trajectories of mass of calcium in the solution and the average (in mass) particle size. Accurate prediction of brushite particles growth is directly related to reliable computation of the process states associated with mass and population balances, which was easily obtained. However, the main modelling challenge was to express the particle growth as a result of simultaneous consumption of calcium in the solution and transformation of HAP into brushite. The main contribution of this work is the kinetics model proposed which belongs to the general class of crystallization kinetics models for which well established theoretical background exists. At the same time the model preserves the physical transparency of the modelled phenomena. We are aware that the dynamical model presented in this paper is only one possible approach to the mathematical interpretation of the dual phenomena of brushite precipitation. It could be somehow considered as imperfect because of insufficient fundamental knowledge in this area. However, our objectives were twofold. From academic point of view the aim was to build a macro model to fit the material balance and explain the main kinetic mechanisms that govern the transformation of the hydroxyapatite into brushite based on a long term laboratory experience and collected large database. From practical point of view, the aim of this modelling exercise was to design a reliable process simulator that can be easily imbedded in industrial software for model-based monitoring, optimization and control purposes. Therefore, the model developed is of particular importance not only for the academic understanding of calcium phosphate formation mechanisms but also for practical purposes of the chemical industry. Research on process monitoring, optimization and control based on the model proposed in this work is now in progress.

The present paper reports a comparative evaluation of four multivariate statistical process control (SPC) techniques for the on-line monitoring of an industrial sugar crystallization process. The process itself is challenging since it is carried out in multiple phases and there exists strong non-linear and dynamic effects between the variables. The methods investigated include classical on-line univariate statistical process control, batch dynamic principal component analysis (BDPCA), moving window principal component analysis (MWPCA), batch observation level analysis (BOL) and time-varying state space modelling (TVSS). The study is focused on issues of on-line detection of changes in crystallization process operation, the early warning of process malfunctions and potential production failures; problems that have not been directly addressed by existing statistical monitoring schemes. The results obtained demonstrate the superior performance of the TVSS approach to successfully detect abnormal events and periods of bad operation early enough to allow bad batches and related losses in amounts of recycled sucrose to be significantly reduced. Keywords Statistical process control Dynamic principal component analysis Batch sugar crystallization 1 Introduction Sugar crystallization occurs through the mechanisms of nucleation, growth and agglomeration. The impact of operating conditions on these activities is not always well-understood. It can be characterised as a non-linear, non-stationary process. Significant research has been carried out into the development of first principles models (Feyo de Azevedo, Chorão, Gonçalves, & Bento, 1994) to describe the process. More recently hybrid models based on both first principles and neural network models have been proposed (Georgieva, Feyo de Azevedo, Goncalves, & Ho, 2003a; Georgieva, Meireles, & Feyo de Azevedo, 2003b). However, these models have been developed for process state estimation, the prediction of crystal size distribution (CSD) and for various control objectives including tracking, optimisation and robustness. The issues of the on-line detection of changes in process operation, early warning of process malfunctions and potential production failures have not been directly addressed by the existing models. In this paper, an empirical statistical approach is adopted for the development of a statistical model based on the available process measurements. Techniques investigated include moving window principal component analysis (MWPCA, Lennox, Montague, Hiden, Kornfeld, & Goulding, 2001); batch observation level (BOL, Wold, Kettaneh, Friden, & Holmberg, 1998), batch dynamic principal component analysis (BDPCA, Chen & Liu, 2002) and time-varying state space modelling (TVSS, Simoglou, Martin, & Morris, 2002a, 2002b). These approaches assume that the available data captures the underlying process operating conditions. Then multivariate statistics such as Hotelling's T 2 and the squared prediction error (SPE) are to be calculated along with their appropriate control limits. These metrics and associated control limits are then used for the on-line monitoring of the process and the classification of a batch as in- or out-of-specification. 2 Process operation The batch cycle of white sugar production is divided into several sequential phases. During the first phase, the pan is partially filled with a juice containing dissolved sucrose (termed liquor). The liquor is concentrated by evaporation, under vacuum, until supersaturation reaches a predefined value (typically 1.15). At this stage, seed crystals are introduced into the pan to induce the production of crystals. This is the beginning of the second (crystallization) phase. As water is evaporated, the dissolved sugar concentration increases, resulting in crystal growth. As evaporation takes place, further liquor or water is added to the pan to maintain the level of supersaturation and increase the volume. For economical reasons, towards the end of this phase, the liquor is replaced by other juices of lower purity (termed syrup). The third phase consists of tightening which is principally controlled by evaporation capacity. At the end of a batch, the pan is filled with a suspension of sugar crystals in heavy syrup, which is dropped into a storage mixer before centrifugation. Present pan control involves the manipulation of the feed flow rate of sugar liquor/syrup and the vacuum pressure. The process objective is to obtain sugar of high quality, which is measured in terms of the purity, shape and CSD at the batch end. CSD is quantified by the mass averaged crystal size (MA) and the coefficient of variation (CV). The desired values for MA are 0.5–0.6mm and for CV: 28–32%. 2.1 Available measurements The industrial unit is equipped with 15 sensors. The on-line recorded physical measurements relating to a batch are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 , Measured input and output measurements, respectively, and Table 3 those variables that are constant for each batch. These are all known to be reliable measurements. The brix of the solution is the concentration of total dissolved solids (sucrose plus impurities) in the solution and is measured by a refractometer. Supersaturation is not a measured variable but can be determined from the available measurements. 3 On-line multivariate statistical process control (SPC) techniques Batch process modelling and monitoring has been always a challenging problem in chemical engineering due to the presence of non-linear behaviour and serial correlation, correlated and/or collinear data, varying batch lengths and multi-product production. Current state of the art empirical techniques include the bi-linear approaches of multi-way principal component analysis (MPCA) and multi-way partial least squares (MPLS), Nomikos and MacGregor (1994) and the tri-linear methodologies of PARAFAC (Bro, 1997) and PARAFAC II (Wise, Gallagher, & Martin, 2001 and Smilde, 1992). Although the above bi-linear and tri-linear techniques have been successfully applied to batch processes, they experience a number of limitations. For example, they do not incorporate the process dynamics and with the exception of PARAFAC II, the duration of the batches are assumed to be constant. Moreover, for on-line monitoring, it is required that the whole batch trajectory is known or is predictable. This requirement results in certain assumptions being made in order to in-fill the unknown future values of the batch trajectory. Finally, all these techniques are linear and to a greater or lesser extent fail to capture the non-linear nature of a batch process. To overcome the issues of data in-filling and unequal batches, alternative approaches have been proposed. 3.1 Moving window principal component analysis Moving window principal component analysis was proposed by Lennox et al. (2001). Typically measurements from a batch process are arranged in a three-dimensional matrix X (NB×NV×NT) where NB, NV and NT are the number of batches, variables and time instants (Fig. 1a). The three-dimensional matrix X can be transformed to a bi-dimensional matrix by unfolding over the batch dimension (NB×(NV×NT)) as shown in Fig. 1b. A scaling is usually applied to the unfolded matrix X before an ordinary PCA analysis. The mean of each column of X is subtracted from each data element of this column. This way of mean centring is very important since it results in the removal of the main non-linear component in the data. Furthermore, by scaling the variables in each column of X, the differences in the measurement units between variables can be handled to allow equal weight to be given to each variable at each time interval. A PCA model is then developed on a moving window of data. Having selected the length of the moving window (L), MWPCA then develops NT − L +1 PCA models for each time interval by decomposing the (NB×NV) matrix X. into a systematic and noisy part: (1) X = T k P k T + E where T k and P k are the matrices of the k retained principal component scores and loading, respectively, while E is the matrix of the residuals. The number of the retained principal components, k, is usually determined by the means of cross-validation. For the application considered, the order of the moving window was selected to be L =2 which takes into account the desired previous data over two past sample intervals. For each of the NT − L +1 PCA models the loading matrix P k , is stored. Having performed a PCA analysis, a set of on-line monitoring tools can then be developed. Typically these tools are Hotelling's T 2 and squared prediction error control charts. Consider that a new batch x new is to be monitored. Then, Hotelling's T 2 is calculated using the k retained PCA scores: (2) t k = x new P k (3) T 2 = t t S t − 1 t t T where t k are the k retained PCA scores and S is their covariance matrix. The SPE is then calculated as follows: (4) SPE = e t e t T (5) e = x new ( I − P k P k T ) 3.2 Batch dynamic principal component analysis The MWPCA approach does not capture the dynamic behaviour within a batch process. Chen and Liu (2002), proposed batch dynamic principal component analysis, in an attempt to explain the batch process dynamics. They suggested the use of lagged variables to incorporate process dynamics. More specifically in BDPCA, each batch is isolated from the others (Fig. 2a). A matrix X iv (NT×NV) is formed for each iv batch. Then each of the NV variables is lagged d times resulting in an lagged X iv [(NT − d)×(NV×(d +1))] matrix (Fig. 2b). The covariance matrix of the lagged X iv matrix, S iv, is then calculated (Fig. 2c). The procedure is repeated for all NB batches, resulting in NB S iv covariance matrices. The elements in each of the S iv matrices are a measure of the dynamic relationship between variables in Batch iv. Having calculated these dynamic correlations for all NB batches an average covariance matrix, S avg, is then calculated based on the NB S iv covariance matrices (Fig. 2d): (6) S avg = ( NT − d − 1 ) ∑ iv = 1 NB S iv NV ( NT − d ) The average covariance matrix, S avg, expresses the average dynamic relationships between the process measurements. A PCA model is then developed based on S avg (Fig. 2e). The resulting BDPCA model is finally used to calculate the T 2 and SPE statistics for monitoring purposes. 3.3 Batch observation level To overcome the problem with unequal batch lengths an alternative monitoring approach was proposed by Wold et al. (1998), termed batch observation level. In BOL, the original three-way data are unfolded over the variables dimension (Fig. 3a). A dummy y -variable that can be a time index or a batch maturity index is then specified. Data are scaled and a partial least squares (PLS) analysis is then performed between the unfolded matrix X and the dummy y vector: (7) X = T k P k T + E (8) y = T k c + f where c is the regression vector of y onto the PLS scores T k (Fig. 3b), and f are the PLS model residuals. The number of PLS latent variables to be retained are selected as those that provide an adequate description of both the X and y spaces. For setting up an on-line monitoring scheme, the scores of the retained PLS scores are then rearranged over the batch dimension resulting in a [NB×(NT× k)] matrix, Fig. 3c and their mean and standard deviation calculated for each sample point and stored (Fig. 3d.). In an on-line situation, when a new sample is obtained, the scores are initially calculated and then scaled using the mean and the standard deviation of the corresponding sample point. These scaled scores are plotted against their control limits in univariate score plot charts. Similar to the previous approaches, T 2 and SPE charts can also be constructed. 3.4 Time-varying state space modelling A different approach to batch process modelling and monitoring is currently under investigation, introduced by Simoglou et al. (2002a), namely time-varying state space (TVSS) modelling. The state space model developed takes the form: (9) t t + 1 = C t t t + w t (10) y t = H t t t + e t where t are the system states, y are the available process measurements, w and e are the state and output residuals with covariance matrices Q and R, respectively. Finally, C and H are the state space model matrices, which are assumed to be time-varying since they aim to describe a non-stationary process. To develop the model ((9) and (10)), the data are initially unfolded and scaled as in MWPCA. The procedure to compute the TVSS matrices C and H then proceeds through the identification of the system states. For a time interval t = k, the past and the future of the system is defined as shown in Fig. 4a. The past ( p ) of the process is associated with the past process measurements of all batches at time k up to a specific lag (in Fig. 4a the time lag, K, was set to a value of two past sample intervals to encapsulate the relevant past data): (11) p t = [ y t − 1 y t − 2 ⋯ y t − k ] T The future ( f ) of the process are the current and future process measurements of all batches (in Fig. 4a the future horizon, L, is set up to a value of one): (12) f t = [ y t y t + 1 ⋯ y t + L ] T Now, by applying any one of either partial least squares, principal component regression (PCR) or canonical variate analysis (CVA) between the past (11) and the future (12) of the process, new latent variables can be calculated which provide a reliable approximation of the true system states. PCR scores capture the variability between process measurements while PLS and CVA latent variables are those linear combinations of the past that include the information required to predict process future. The result of applying either a PCR, PLS or CVA analysis is a weighting matrix J t which is used to identify the system states through the past vector p t : (13) t t = J t p t Once the system states have been identified the state space matrices can be computed using a least squares solution (see Simoglou et al., 2001, for more details). In the next section, the four multivariate techniques (BOL, MWPCA, BDPCA and TVSS) are applied and compared with the univariate SPC for the ‘on-line’ performance monitoring of the sugar crystallization process. 4 On-line SPC of sugar crystallization Data from 14 industrial runs were available from a sampling period of 4 months. Batches were discriminated as being ‘in-specification’ or ‘out-of-specification’ based on the final CSD properties. Eleven batches were identified as being in-specification whilst three had MA values out with the specification range. 4.1 Data pre-processing Prior to developing the statistical models it was necessary to make decisions related to the selection of the crystallization phases and the process variables to be included in the monitoring model. The phases to be modelled were selected to be the crystallization phase and the tightening phase. The initial operations before seeding (charging and concentration) were excluded from the analysis because their objectives are to feed a certain initial quantity of juice into the pan and to concentrate it until a predefined level as soon as possible. Therefore, the main effect of these stages on the next operations is the time it takes to reach the same initial conditions (supersaturation set point) for the crystallization period. Moreover, in practice, no specific faults are observed during this phase of process operations. The variables included in the analysis were vacuum pressure, steam flowrate, steam pressure, steam temperature, brix of the solution, supersaturation and temperature of the solution. To control the supersaturation around the metastable zone, process operators periodically open and close the respective liquor/syrup and water flow valves. Thus, in the available data set, there are periods where both feed flowrates are equal to zero. Building a statistical model based on this data set results in the model being trained on data where the feed flow rates are zero. However, if for a new batch, process conditions force operators to open one of the feed valves for control purposes, then for this particular time point the statistical model will move outside of the limits resulting in a possible false alarm. The feed variables were thus excluded which does not result in a loss of information since their effect directly impacts on the other process variables (Brix of the solution and the supersaturation) included in the data set. A calculated variable (supersaturation) was also included as a critical sugar crystallization parameter. 4.2 On-line univariate SPC Figs. 5–7 show the most significant variables for the three bad batches along with univariate, ±3σ, control limits. For Batches 1 and 3, the variables lie within the univariate control limits for most of the batch run. Those observations that marginally lie out with the statistical limits, for example, time point 89 in Fig. 5a, are very close to the statistical control limit and it was concluded that they were statistically spurious signals (on average one in hundred observations will lie outside the 99% action limits). It is observed that only Batch 2 has variables that exceed the univariate control limits. It was only in this particular case, that the application of univariate SPC could detect periods of out-of-specification operation. 4.3 On-line multivariate SPC The multivariate SPC techniques of MWPCS, BOL, BDPCA and TVSS discussed in Section 3 were then used to ‘monitor’ the real process data. All the approaches compared are linear, can deal with unequal batch lengths and to a greater or lesser extent can describe the underlying batch process dynamics. Having built and validated the four models from in-specification process data, the next step was to evaluate their ability to detect the out-of-specification batches and provide information as to the variable(s) responsible for the out-of-specification signal. The results are summarised in Figs. 8–11 . T 2 and SPE control charts are shown alongside their corresponding contribution plots. The contribution plot (Miller, Swanson, & Heckler, 1998) shows the contribution of the original seven process variables to the T 2 or SPE value for the maximum out-of-control value. For example, Fig. 8a shows how the T 2 statistic would evolve in an on-line manner with MWPCA for out-of-specification Batch 1. T 2 takes its maximum value at time point 89, and Fig. 8b shows the T 2 contribution plot for this particular point. In all the control charts, the values shown were scaled so that the run-time control limits were equal to unity for the whole batch run. This way of presenting the control charts is more user-friendly for process operators. It also allows the four statistical methods to be compared on a common basis as the degree to which the T 2 and SPE statistic exceed the limits can be quantified. In general, it can be seen that the four methods identify periods of out-of-specification operation during the run in all three batches for both SPE and T 2 control charts. It is only for the T 2 metric of BDPCA, Fig. 10e, where there is no out-of-control signal for Batch 3. Thus, by applying multivariate SPC as opposed to univariate SPC periods of out-of-specification operation can be detected. The SPE and T 2 control charts for Batch 2 (not included in this paper but available in the authors graph set) lead to similar conclusions as for the other two batches. Since the univariate control charts clearly detected out-of-specification operation for Batch 2 (Fig. 6), it was decided to illustrate only the batches for which the univariate approach was not efficient. In Fig. 8a, the MWPCA based T 2 control chart for Batch 1, there is a period of out-of-specification operation around time point 89. The univariate control charts indicated out-of-specification operation for the time period 88–90. More specifically, the univariate control charts of vacuum pressure (Fig. 5a) and solution temperature (Fig. 5d) move outside the limits for these time points. In the multivariate T 2 control chart, out-of-specification operation is detected earlier and takes its maximum value at time point 89. The T 2 contribution plot for time point 89 (Fig. 8b) indicates that variable 1 (vacuum pressure) is responsible for the out-of-control signal. This conclusion is in accordance with the univariate SPC control charts. T 2 control charts for the other three methods for Batch 1, TVSS (Fig. 9a), BDPCA (Fig. 10a) and BO (Fig. 11a) provided maximum T 2 out-of-control signals for the time period around point 345. Univariate SPC provides an out-of-control signal for the brix of the solution for this time period Fig. 5b. However, the fault is not detected as early as for the multivariate control charts and the level of excursion outside the limits is smaller for the univariate control charts. The contribution plot for TVSS (Fig. 9b) indicates that the steam temperature and the brix of the solution are mainly responsible for the out-of-control signal. The respective contribution plots for BDPCA (Fig. 10b) and BOL (Fig. 11b) also indicate that the brix of the solution is mainly responsible for the out-of-control signal. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the monitoring of Batch 3. The multivariate SPC techniques provide an earlier warning of the process faults than univariate SPC with the T 2 statistic clearly exceeding the control limits. For example, in Batch 3 there is a time period around point 155 where T 2 exceeds the limit. With the exception of BDPCA, all the MSPC approaches provided an alarm indicating that supersaturation is responsible for the out-of-control signal. This conclusion is in agreement with the respective univaritate SPC chart. The four multivariate monitoring techniques of MWPCS, BOl, BDPCA and TVSS exhibit similar performance and capability in terms of distinguishing between in and out-of-specification behaviour. However, the TVSS approach captures the underlying dynamic relationship between the process variables more clearly than the other three approaches. For example, according to the control charts in Fig. 9a and c, an abnormal situation arises around time interval 325–375. Examining the time trajectories of the measured variables for Batch 1, it is observed that for the same period the steam pressure (Fig. 5c) that operationally should be kept at around 1.9–2.2bar for safety reasons, goes outside of this limit. This causes a rapid decrease in the brix (Fig. 5b) and subsequently supersaturation moves out-of the metastable zone (decreases), which results in the dissolution of the existing crystals. These variations are captured by the contribution plots (Fig. 9b and d) and an alarm signal generated by the monitoring scheme is justified. For Batch 3, by observing the time series plots, it can be concluded that the main variables that determine the working conditions, namely vacuum pressure, steam pressure, flowrate and temperature are controlled around their nominal values. However, after time point 150, the brix (Fig. 7b) and supersaturation (Fig. 7c) start to decrease for no obvious reason. This experience has shown that this effect is due to unexpected changes in the purity of the feed, which is not an on-line measured variable and thus not included in the data set. Thus, for this reason the BDPCA T 2 statistic did not identify the problem whilst the corresponding SPE control charts only detected very short periods of out-of-specification operation. 5 Conclusions In this paper, four on-line multivariate process performance monitoring schemes for an industrial sugar crystallization process were applied and compared with univariate SPC techniques. The process itself is challenging since it is carried out in multiple phases and there exists strong non-linear and dynamic effects between the variables. The methods proposed to develop the on-line monitoring scheme were moving window principal component analysis, batch observation level, batch dynamic principal component analysis and time-varying state space modelling. The monitoring schemes were applied in an on-line mode for three batches whose final product was out-of-specification. It was found that all methods could identify clearly periods of bad operation for all three batches and perform better than the traditional univariate SPC. Although the BDPCA approach is attractive in that the quality variables are closely correlated with and are reflected by the process measurements, the TVSS methodology is much more effective in handling varying batch lengths, non-linear data, and presence of serial correlation between measurements.

INTRODUCTION Sucrose crystallisation, carried out in evaporative crystallisers, operating under vacuum in a semi-batch regime, constitutes a relevant industrial crystallization process. It can be characterised as a strong non-linear and non-stationary process. Significant scientific work has been carried out into the development of mechanistic dynamical models to describe the process, Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1996. More recently a knowledge-based hybrid model (KBHM) based on a combination of a partial mechanistic and artificial neural network (ANN) model was proposed by Georgieva et al., 2003. However, these models were focused on various estimation, optimization and feedback control problems. The issues of the on-line detection of changes in process operation, early warning of process malfunctions and potential production failures have not been directly addressed by the existing models. In the present paper, a new methodology for crystallization modelling and monitoring is proposed. It is a fully data driven approach based on a time varying state space (TVSS) model. A TVSS model is developed for each time interval of the batch duration. The approach is multivariate and dynamic while by building successive local models over the batch duration faces more efficiently than current techniques the issue of non-linear behaviour. It can deal with unequal batch lengths while for on-line monitoring it does not require any assumptions for filling missing future data of the batch. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a short description of the process operation. In 27 section 3 current state of the art statistical process control (SPC) methodologies are reviewed. In section 4 the TVSS model is proposed. In section 5 the proposed modelling scheme is validated against a comprehensive crystallization simulation and compared with the reviewed in section 3 approaches. The paper ends up with conclusions and references. 2. PROCESS OPERATION Sugar crystallization operation takes place in six phases: i) initial filling and concentration; ii) seeding; iii) setting the grain; iv) crystallization; v) tightening and vi) discharging to a storage mixer before centrifugation. Typically seeding is performed at a supersaturation of 1.15. Often at the start of this period some form of thinning with water is required in order to prevent formation of conglomerates. Crystallization takes the longest period and has to be controlled primarily by the feed flow driven by supersaturation, consistency and crystal production requirements. Tightening is principally controlled by the capacity for evaporation. The unit contains 15 sensors for the following properties and operating variables: i) inside the pan massecuite temperatures at three locations; brix of solution; level; massecuite consistency; stirrer current; vacuum pressure and temperature. ii) feed conditions - temperature, brix and flow rate of feed liquor and feed syrups. iii) steam conditions temperature, pressure and flow rate of steam. Brix is the concentration of total dissolved solids (sucrose plus impurities) in the solution. Supersaturation is not a measured variable but can be determined from the available measurements. The feed flow rate of sugar liquor/syrup and the vacuum pressure are considered as process inputs. The crystal contents and the crystal size distribution (CSD) characterise the productivity and the product quality. 3. CURRENT ON-LINE STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL TECHNIQUES Batch process modelling and monitoring has been always a challenging problem in chemical engineering due to the presence of non-linear behaviour and serial correlation, correlated and/or collinear data, varying batch lengths and multiproduct production. Current empirical techniques include the bi-linear approaches of multi-way Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multi-way Partial Least Squares (PLS), and the tri-linear methodologies of PARAFAC. Although the above techniques have been successfully applied to batch processes they experience a number of limitations. For example they do not incorporate the process dynamics and most of them assume the duration of the batches to be constant. Moreover, for on-line monitoring, it is required that the whole batch trajectory is known or is predictable. This requirement results in certain assumptions being made in order to in-fill the unknown future values of the batch trajectory. To overcome the issues of data in-filling and unequal batches alternative approaches have been proposed. 3.1 Moving window principal component analysis Moving Window Principal Component Analysis (MWPCA) was proposed by Lennox et al. 2001. Typically measurements from a batch process are arranged in a three-dimensional matrix X (NB×NV×NT) where NB, NV and NT are the number of batches, variables and time instants. The threedimensional matrix X can be transformed to a bidimensional matrix by unfolding over the batch dimension (NB× (NVNT)). A scaling is usually applied to the unfolded matrix X before an ordinary PCA analysis. The mean of each column of X is subtracted from each data element of this column. This way of mean centring is very important since it results in the removal of the main non-linear component in the data. Furthermore, by scaling the variables in each column of X, the differences in the measurement units between variables can be handled to allow equal weight to be given to each variable at each time interval. A PCA model is then developed on a moving window of data. Having selected the length of the moving window (L), MWPCA then develops NT-L+1 PCA models for each time interval by decomposing the (NB× NV) matrix X. into a systematic and noisy part: X = Tk PkT + E (1) where Tk and Pk are the matrices of the k retained principal component scores and loading respectively, while E is the matrix of the residuals. The number of the retained principal components, k, is usually determined by the means of cross-validation. For the process considered the order of the moving window was selected to be L=2. For each of the NT-L+1 PCA models the loading matrix Pk, is stored. Having performed a PCA analysis, a set of on-line monitoring tools can then be developed. Typically these tools are Hotelling's T2 and Squared Prediction Error (SPE) control charts. Consider that a new batch x new is to be monitored. Then Hotelling's T2 is calculated using the k retained PCA scores t k = x new Pk T 2 = t t S t-1 t T t (2) (3) where tk are the k retained PCA scores and S is their covariance matrix. The SPE is then calculated as follows: SPE = e t e T t (4) 28 e = x new (I - Pk PkT ) 3.2 Batch dynamic principal component analysis (5) The MWPCA approach does not capture the dynamic behaviour within a batch process. Chen and Liu, 2000, proposed Batch Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (BDPCA), in an attempt to explain the batch process dynamics. They suggested the use of lagged variables to incorporate process dynamics. More specifically in BDPCA, each batch is isolated from the others. A matrix X (NT×NV) is formed for each batch. Then each of the NV variables is lagged d times resulting in an lagged X[(NT-d)×(NV(d+1))] matrix. The covariance matrix of the lagged X matrix, Siv, is then calculated. The procedure is repeated for all NB batches, resulting in NB Siv covariance matrices. The elements in each of the Siv matrices are a measure of the dynamic relationship between variables in batch iv. Having calculated these dynamic correlations for all NB batches an average covariance matrix, is then calculated based on the NB Siv covariance matrices : ( NT - d - 1) S iv iv =1 NB scores are then rearranged over the batch dimension resulting in a [NB×(NTk)] matrix, and their mean and standard deviation calculated for each sample point and stored. In an on-line situation, when a new sample is obtained, the scores are initially calculated and then scaled using the mean and the standard deviation of the corresponding sample point. These scaled scores are plotted against their control limits in univariate score plot charts. Similarly to the previous approaches, T2 and SPE charts can also be constructed. 4. TIME VARYING STATE SPACE MODELL The underlying idea of this paper is that a batch process can be described by a time-varying state space (TVSS) model. This new approach was recently introduced by Simoglou et al., 2002a. The state space model developed takes the form: t t +1 = Ct t t + w t y t = H t t t + et (9) (10) S avg = NV ( NT - d ) (6) The average covariance matrix, S avg , expresses the average dynamic relationships between the process measurements. A PCA model is then developed based on S avg . The resulting BDPCA model is finally used to calculate the T2 and SPE statistics for monitoring purposes. 3.3 Batch observation level To overcome the problem with unequal batch lengths an alternative monitoring approach was proposed by Wold et al, 1998, termed Batch Observation Level (BOL). In BOL the original threeway data is unfolded over the variables dimension. A dummy y-variable that can be a time index or a batch maturity index is then specified. Data is scaled and a Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis is then performed between the unfolded matrix X and the dummy y vector: X = Tk P + E T k where t are the system states, y are the available process measurements, w and e are the state and output residuals with covariance matrices Q and R respectively. Finally C and H are the state space model matrices, which are assumed to be timevarying since they aim to describe a non-stationary process. To develop the model (9-10) the data are initially unfolded and scaled as in MWPCA. The procedure to compute the TVSS matrices C and H then proceeds through the identification of the system states. For a sample time t = k , past and future of the system are considered. The past (p) is associated with the past process measurements of all batches at time k up to a specific lag K : p t = [y t -1 y t - 2 L y t - K ]T (11) The choice of K as the length of the past vector window is in terms of capturing the relevant dynamics of the system being studied. In the case considered K=2. The future (f) of the process are the current and future process measurements of all batches (in practical cases the future horizon, L, can be set as one or two): f t = [y t y t +1 L y t + L ]T (12) (7) (8) The choice of the length of the moving window L is also based on the dynamics of the process being studied; too large and the sensitivity of the process malfunction is reduced, whilst too small a window would be impacted by process noise. Now, by applying any one of either PLS, Principal Component Regression (PCR) or Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) between the past (11) and the future (12) of the process, new latent variables can be calculated which provide a reliable approximation of the true y = Tk c + f where c is the regression vector of y onto the PLS scores Tk,, and f are the PLS model residuals. The number of PLS latent variables to be retained are selected as those that provide an adequate description of both the X and y spaces. For setting up an on-line monitoring scheme the scores of the retained PLS 29 system states. PCR scores capture the variability between process measurements while PLS and CVA latent variables are those linear combinations of the past that include the information required to predict process future. The result of applying either a PCR, PLS or CVA analysis is a weighting matrix J t which is used to identify the system states through the past vector p t : t t = J t pt (13) Once the system states have been identified the state space matrices can be computed using a least squares solution, (see Simoglou et al., 2001, for more details). In the next section, the TVSS methodology is validated and compared with the univariate SPC and the multivariate techniques reviewed in section 3 (MWPCA, BDPCA, BOL) using a comprehensive simulation of an industrial white sugar crystallizer. 5. ON-LINE SPC OF SUGAR CRYSTALLISATION Data from 14 industrial runs were available from a sampling period of 4 months. Batches were discriminated as being `in-specification' or `out-ofspecification' based on the final CSD properties. Eleven batches were identified as being inspecification whilst three had CSD values out of the specification range. Data pre-processing Prior to developing the statistical models it was necessary to make decisions related to the selection of the crystallization phases and the process variables to be included in the monitoring model. The phases to be modelled were selected to be the `crystallisation' phase and the `tightening' phase. The initial operations before seeding (charging and concentration) were excluded from the analysis because their main objectives are to feed a certain initial quantity of juice into the pan and to concentrate it until a predefined level as soon as possible. Therefore, the main effect of these stages on the next operations is the time it takes to reach the same initial conditions (supersaturation set point) for the crystallization period. Moreover in practice no specific faults are observed during this phase of process operations. The variables included in the analysis were vacuum pressure, steam flowrate, steam pressure, steam temperature, brix of the solution, supersaturation and temperature of the solution. To control the supersaturation around the metastable zone, process operators periodically open and close the respective liquor/syrup flow valve. Thus in the available data set there are periods where the feed flowrate is equal to zero. Building a statistical model based on this data set results in the model being trained on data where the feed flow rate is zero. However if for a new batch, process conditions force operators to open the feed valve for control purposes, then for this particular time point the statistical model will move outside of the limits resulting in a possible false alarm. The feed variables were thus excluded which does not result in a loss of information since their effect directly impacts on the other process variables (the brix in the solution and the supersaturation) included in the data set. A calculated variable (supersaturation) was also included as a critical sugar crystallisation parameter. On-line Univariate SPC On-line univariate SPC was applied to the tree batches identified as out of specification. Only Batch 2 (not depicted in the figure) was clearly detected as out-of-spec. Fig.1 shows the most significative variables for out-of-spec Batch 1 along with univariate, ±3, control limits. Note that the variables lie within the univariate control limits for most of the batch run. Those observations that lie out with the limits, for example time point 89 in Fig. 1a, are still close to the limits and thus it is concluded that they are spurious signals, i.e. on average one in hundred observations will lie outside the 99% action limits. As a result, the Batch 1 would be classified by this method as good. Thus, the univariate SPC cannot detect reliably periods of out-of-spec operation. On-line multivariate SPC The TVSS approach presented in section 4 and the multivariate SPC techniques of MWPCS, BOL, and BDPCA discussed in section 3 were then used to `monitor' the real process data. Having built and validated the four models from in-specification process data, the next step was to evaluate their ability to detect the out-of-specification batches and provide information as to the variable(s) responsible for the out-of-specification signal. The results for out-of-spec Batch 1 are summarised in Fig.2 to Fig.5. T2 statistics are shown alongside their corresponding contribution plots. The contribution plots shows the contribution of the original seven process variables to the maximum out of control value. In all the control charts, the values shown were scaled so that the runtime control limits were equal to unity for the whole batch run. This way of presenting the control charts is more user-friendly for process operators. It also allows the four statistical methods to be compared on a common basis as the degree to which the T2 exceeds the limits can be quantified. In general it was observed that the four methods identify periods of out-of-specification operation during the run in all three batches (not depicted in the figures) for the T2 control charts. Thus by applying multivariate SPC as opposed to univariate SPC, 30 periods of out-of-specification operation can be detected. In Fig. 2a, the MWPCA based T2 control chart for Batch 1, there is a period of out-of-specification operation around time point 89. The univariate control charts indicated out-of-specification operation for the time period 88-90. More specifically the univariate control charts of vacuum pressure (Fig. 1a) and the temperature of the solution (Fig. 1c) move outside the limits for these time points. In the multivariate T2 control chart, out-ofspec operation is detected earlier and takes its maximum value at time point 89. The T2 contribution plot for time point 89 (Fig.2b) indicates that variable 1 (vacuum pressure) is responsible for the out-ofcontrol signal. This conclusion is in accordance with the univariate SPC control charts. T2 control charts of Batch 1, applying BDPCA (Fig. 3a), BOL (Fig.4a) and TVSS (Fig. 5a), provided maximum T2 out-of-control signals for the time period around point 345. Univariate SPC provides an out-of-control signal for the brix of the solution for this time period (Fig.1b). However the fault is not detected as early as for the multivariate control charts and the level of excursion outside the limits is smaller for the univariate control charts. The contribution plot for TVSS (Fig. 5b) indicates that the steam temperature and the brix of the solution are mainly responsible for the out-of-control signal. The respective contribution plots for BDPCA (Fig. 3b) and BOL (Fig. 4b) also indicate that the brix of the solution is mainly responsible for the out-of-control signal. The four multivariate monitoring techniques of MWPCS, BOL, BDPCA and TVSS exhibit similar performance and capability in terms of distinguishing between in and out-of-specification behaviour. However the TVSS approach captures the underlying dynamic relationship between the process variables more clearly than the other three approaches. For example according to the control charts in Fig.1d, an abnormal situation arises around time interval 325375. Examining the time trajectories of the measured variables for Batch 1, it is observed that for the same period the steam pressure (Fig.1b) that operationally should be kept at around 1.9-2.2. bar for safety reasons, goes outside of this limit. This causes a rapid decrease in the brix (Fig.5b) and subsequently supersaturation moves out of the metastable zone (decreases) which results in the dissolution of the existing crystals. These variations are captured by the contribution plot (Fig. 5b) and an alarm signal generated by the monitoring scheme is justified. 5. CONCLUSIONS A novel modelling approach was proposed to model an industrial sugar crystallization fed-batch process using a time varying state space (TVSS) model. The process itself is challenging since it is carried out in multiple phases and there exists strong non-linear and dynamic effects between the variables. The TVSS methodology was compared with current state-of-theart monitoring schemes as Moving Window Principal Component Analysis (MWPCA), Batch Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (BDPCA) and Batch Observation Level (BOL). The monitoring schemes were applied in an on-line mode for three batches whose final product was out-of-specification. It was found that all methods could identify clearly periods of bad operation for all three batches and perform better than the traditional univariate SPC. However, the results obtained demonstrate the superior performance of the TVSS approach to successfully detect abnormal events and periods of out-of-spec operation. The TVSS methodology is much more effective in handling varying batch lengths, nonlinear data, and presence of serial correlation between measurements.

However the TVSS approach captures the underlying dynamic relationship between the process variables more clearly than the other three approaches. For example according to the control charts in Fig.1d, an abnormal situation arises around time interval 325375. Examining the time trajectories of the measured variables for Batch 1, it is observed that for the same period the steam pressure (Fig.1b) that operationally should be kept at around 1.9-2.2. bar for safety reasons, goes outside of this li IPV 37592 S1474-6670(16)37592-9 10.3182/20050703-6-CZ-1902.01580 IFAC A TIME VARYING STATE SPACE APPROACH FOR SUGAR CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESS MODELLING AND MONITORING A.

The study is focused on issues of on-line detection of changes in crystallization process operation, the early warning of process malfunctions and potential production failures; problems that have not been directly addressed by existing statistical monitoring schemes. The TVSS methodology is compared with current state-of-the-art techniques and the results obtained demonstrate the superior performance of the TVSS approach to successfully detect abnormal events and periods of bad operation.

The system contains a neural identifier, and a neural controller, based on the recurrent trainable neural network model. The applicability of the proposed direct adaptive neural control system of both proportional and integral-term direct adaptive neural control schemes is confirmed by comparative simulation results, obtained with a nonlinear mathematical model of an aerobic continuous stirred tank reactor. The comparison is done also with respect to the X-tracking method of control. The obtained comparative graphical simulation results show that the proposed control system exhibit good convergence, but the I-term control system could compensate a constant offset and proportional control systems could not.",

        "doc_abstract": "The paper describes statistical process control tools that have been applied for the online monitoring of an industrial fed-batch sugar crystallisation process. The process is characterised by distinct operating phases during operation and the presence of strong non-linear, dynamic relationships between the variables. Process performance is controlled manually by operators based on their experience. The success of each batch is determined at the end of the batch run through off-line crystal size distribution measurements. The development and application of a monitoring tool based on the online frequent process measurements could be of significant benefit, since it could realise early detection of operational changes, process faults and hence a reduction in the number of off-specification batches. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

        "doc_abstract": "This paper reports on the application of knowledge-based hybrid (KBH) modelling to an industrial scale (fed-) batch evaporative crystallisation process in cane sugar refining. First, principles models of the process lead in general to good description of process state, except for the prediction of the main crystal size distribution (CSD) parameters-mean size and the coefficient of variation. This is due to difficulties in expressing accurately nucleation and crystal growth rates and especially the complex phenomena of agglomeration in the relevant population balance. A hybrid model is proposed, which combines a partial mechanistic model that reflects the general mass, energy and population balances with a neural network to express growth rate, nucleation kinetics and agglomeration phenomena. Results obtained demonstrate a better agreement between experimental data and hybrid model predictions than that observed with the complete mechanistic model. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Fax: +351-22-508-1632/1449 This paper reports on the application of knowledge-based hybrid (KBH) modelling to an industrial scale (fed-) batch evaporative crystallisation process in cane sugar refining. First, principles models of the process lead in general to good description of process state, except for the prediction of the main crystal size distribution (CSD) parameters—mean size and the coefficient of variation. This is due to difficulties in expressing accurately nucleation and crystal growth rates and especially the complex phenomena of agglomeration in the relevant population balance. A hybrid model is proposed, which combines a partial mechanistic model that reflects the general mass, energy and population balances with a neural network to express growth rate, nucleation kinetics and agglomeration phenomena. Results obtained demonstrate a better agreement between experimental data and hybrid model predictions than that observed with the complete mechanistic model. Keywords Sugar crystallisation Agglomeration Hybrid mathematical modelling Parameter identification Neural network 1 Introduction The traditional way of process modelling has been for many years by mathematical equations that essentially express fundamental principles and incorporate transport kinetics and equilibrium relationships. In general terms, this type of fully mechanistic models, when feasible, have the potential to extrapolate beyond the regions (experimental conditions) within which they are constructed. Many are, however, the areas, in chemical and biochemical engineering, where rigorous scientific knowledge of fundamental mechanisms is still scarce, their mathematical representation being for this reason of limited or questionable accuracy. Empirical correlations are typically employed to characterise basic transport or kinetic phenomena. Such approach has been over the years most useful, but it has recognised limitations particularly for expressing time varying states. Independently of the undisputable relevance of pursuing studies that may lead to this far-reaching goal of a priori design, new methods (e.g. data-based modelling techniques) are being developed that are able to extract process knowledge from existing process measured data, in this way overcoming difficulties of knowledge expression. The rapid growth of available computational resources led in recent years to the development of a wide number of data-based modelling methods. They range from well-established statistical techniques, such as multiple linear regression (MLR) and principal component regression (PCR), to non-linear techniques such as non-linear principal component analysis (NLPCA) and non-linear autoregressive moving average with exogenous input (NARMAX). Since about a decade a new group of data-driven modelling techniques has been under scrutiny, the most popular among them being the artificial neural network (ANN) models. ANNs proved to be a powerful modelling alternative to the conventional mathematical description when there is limited understanding of the physical phenomena. Data-based modelling alone has a number of limitations, namely related to the confidence of employing models outside identification (the so-called training) and validation regions. With such identified difficulties, it seems today only natural that the next step was the emergence of methods where different forms of available knowledge for process modelling are combined, in this way trying to maximise knowledge expression. As example, ANN can be employed for modelling complex and poorly known parts of the process otherwise modelled by application of conservation laws (Roubos et al., 1999; Russell and Bakker, 1997; Schubert, Simutis, Dors, Havlik, & Lubbert, 1994a, b; Zorzetto, Maciel Filho, Wolf-Maciel, 2000). This is generally termed as knowledge-based hybrid (KBH) modelling and is today well documented in the literature (Peres, Oliveira, & Feyo de Azevedo, 2001). In this paper, we discuss KBH modelling of industrial scale (fed-) batch evaporative crystallisation in cane sugar refining. Sugar crystallisation is a non-linear and non-stationary process. Crystallisation occurs through mechanisms of nucleation, growth and agglomeration. The relation between operating conditions, process state and those crystallisation mechanisms is poorly known. Consequently, the search for efficient methods for process description is linked both to the scientific interest of understanding fundamental mechanisms of the crystallisation process and to the relevant practical interest of process modelling. The available first principles models lead in general to reasonable description of process states associated with mass and energy balances. Nevertheless, exact prediction of the main crystal size distribution (CSD) parameters—the mean (MA) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the mass-size distribution function is hampered by the lack of reliable formal presentation of the crystallisation mechanism (Feyo de Azevedo, Chorão, Gonçalves, & Bento, 1994; Chorão & Feyo de Azevedo, 1996). More precisely, this is due to difficulties in expressing accurately nucleation and crystal growth rates and especially the complex phenomena of agglomeration in the relevant population balances. This type of difficulty of knowledge expression has been adequately solved in other areas through adopting knowledge-based hybrid approaches, which combine mechanistic, data-driven and fuzzy sources of knowledge (Thompson & Kramer, 1994; Feyo de Azevedo, Dahm, & Oliveira, 1997; Simutis, Oliveira, Manikowski, Feyo de Azevedo, & Lubbert, 1997). A hybrid model of sugar crystallisation was reported recently by Lauret, Boyer, and Gatina (2000), but without accounting for nucleation and agglomeration phenomena. For the industrial set-up considered in the present work there is experimental evidence that agglomeration occurs and neglecting it would lead to underestimation of CSD characteristics. Therefore, the main objective was to develop a reliable model of the process when accounting for nucleation, crystal growth and particle agglomeration phenomena. Serial hybrid modelling has been adopted as a complementary structure of two modules: a mechanistic and a data-driven module. The mechanistic part consists of a set of non-linear algebraic-differential equations, resulting from relevant mass, energy and population balances. The latter is expressed in particle volume co-ordinates, including the first four moments, from where CSD parameters are inferred. The data-driven module supplies the growth rate, nucleation and agglomeration kinetic parameters. After consideration of alternative topologies, a feedforward ANN with four inputs (supersaturation, massecuite temperature, purity of solution and volume fraction of crystals) was adopted. Based upon a data bank of process input and output measurements, the ANN was trained and validated. The global hybrid model was then evaluated for its ability to predict the process outputs (temperature of massecuite and brix of solution) and the CSD parameters (MA and CV). The results obtained demonstrate good interpolative and extrapolative capabilities of the hybrid model. This paves the way for computing more accurate optimal operation profiles and more accurate software sensors for on-line process monitoring. 2 Vacuum pan crystalliser 2.1 Process description The industrial unit of concern is of the fixed calandria type with specially designed tubes for the circulation of heavy viscous massecuite (i.e. a suspension of sugar crystals in heavy syrup). It is equipped with a total condensing steam valve and with a propeller stirrer. The unit has a cylindrical form and characteristics as listed in Table 1. The average operating time of a batch cycle is approximately 90 min . It is divided into several sequential phases as listed in Table 2. Supersaturation is the driving force for crystallisation. In industrial conditions, it can be expressed as the ratio of concentration of sucrose in solution to its saturation concentration for the same process conditions. Crystal growth only occurs when sucrose concentration exceeds the saturation state. All along the batch supersaturation must be kept within safe limits in order to avoid the formation of new crystals (the production of false grain) or the dissolution of the existing ones. This safe zone is called the metastable zone (1<S<1.2). The process operation objective is to maximize yield of sugar with high quality, the latter being essentially measured by the purity, shape and particle size distribution of the crystal population. At the end of a normal industrial batch the expected main characteristics of the final product, i.e. the mass fraction of crystals, the mass averaged crystal size (MA) and the coefficient of variation (CV), should be within the following desired ranges: (i) mass percent of crystals between 56 and 58%; (ii) MA of 0.5–0.6 mm ; and (iii) CV of 28–32%. 2.2 Pan controlled operation Vacuum pan control involves the manipulation of feed flow rate of sugar liquor (a juice containing dissolved sucrose) and of vacuum pressure. Typical operation data are summarised in Table 3. From the control point of view three main phases can be identified, viz. during the first phase (about 20 min ) the pan is partially filled (about 30%) with liquor. The liquor is concentrated by evaporation, under vacuum, until supersaturation reaches a predefined value (typically S=1.15). At this point seed crystals are introduced into the pan to induce the production of crystals. That is the beginning of the second (crystallisation) phase, which lasts for about 60 min . In this phase as evaporation takes place further liquor or water is added to the pan in order to guarantee crystal growth at a controlled supersaturation level and to increase total contents of sugar in the pan. Near to the end of this phase and for economical reasons, the liquor is replaced by other juice of lower purity (termed syrup). The third phase consists of tightening, which is principally controlled by the evaporation capacity. At the end of the batch, the final massecuite undergoes centrifugation, where final refined sugar is separated from liquor (mother liquor) that is recycled to the process. 2.3 Available measurements The on-line collected physical measurements related to a batch are summarised in Table 4 (sampled input measurements) and Table 5 (sampled output measurements). Additional constant operation and control variables are listed in Table 6. Data from 15 (industrial runs) batches are available, sampled during a period of 4 months. The measurements are related to: (i) Feed conditions: flowrate, brix (measured by refractometry), temperature and purity of the fed liquor/syrup and the flowrate and temperature of the water; (ii) Steam conditions: flowrate, temperature and pressure of the steam; (iii) Variables inside the pan: pressure and temperature of the vacuum, the brix and the temperature of the solution, the level in the pan. Supersaturation and mass fraction of crystals are not measured variables, but they are readily determined on the basis of available measurements. The main challenge in process monitoring is the estimation of CSD properties. 3 Partial mechanistic model The modelling of the crystalliser is conceptually obtained by writing the appropriate mass and energy balances together with a mathematical representation of the crystallisation rate. The latter can be achieved through basic mass transfer considerations (Ditl, Beranek, & Rieger, 1990) or by writing a population balance represented by its moment equations (Hulburt & Katz, 1964; Jones, 1974; Randolph & Larson, 1988; Feyo de Azevedo, Chorão, Gonçalves, & Bento, 1993; Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1994). Employing a population balance is generally preferred since it allows to take into account initial experimental distributions and, most significantly, to consider complex mechanisms such as those of size dispersion and/or particle agglomeration/aggregation. Considering some form of particle birth and death by agglomeration or aggregation mechanisms is required though a price is paid on model complexity, which may preclude its use in model-based state estimation and control strategies. A number of publications propose the theory and alternative simplifying mathematical procedures (Hulburt & Katz, 1964; Randolph & Larson, 1988; Hartel & Randolph, 1986; Franck, David, Villermaux, & Klein, 1988; Hounslow, Ryall, & Marshall, 1988; Hounslow, 1990). None of these are applied to sugar crystals but the bases for application are by all means equivalent. 3.1 Model adopted Process modelling involves some simplifying assumptions. In developing the model equations it was accepted that (i) the massecuite is well mixed in the whole pan volume; (ii) its temperature is uniform, given by an averaged value between two temperature measurements; (iii) thermal dynamic delays due to the unit thermal capacity are negligible; (iv) the shape and volume crystal coefficients do not change during crystallisation and (v) all steam supplied is condensed. The state vector includes temperature, mass of water, dissolved sucrose and dissolved impurities in the liquor, mass of sucrose crystals and the population distribution moments. Main intensive variables such as supersaturation and crystal contents are calculated from the set of state variables. An empirical model has been developed for the description of the evaporation rate. 3.2 Mass balances The following set of conservation mass balance equations can be written for water (M w ), impurities (M i ), dissolved sucrose (M s ) and crystals (M c ): (1a) dMw dt =Ffρf(1−Bf)+Fwρw−J vap , (1b) dMi dt =FfρfBf(1−Pur f), (1c) dMs dt =FfρfBf Pur f−J cris , (1d) dMc dt =J cris . The main process non-linearities are included in the crystallisation rate J cris, which has to be computed from the population balance. The heat input and the evaporation rate are given by the following correlations: (2) Q=αsFs ΔHs, (3) J vap = W+Q λw(vac) +k vap (Tm−Tw(vac)−BPE), where α s and k vap are equipment-dependent parameters determined experimentally with data taken from the concentration period at the beginning of the crystallisation cycle before seeding takes place. BPE is the boiling point elevation and the term (T m −T w(vac)−BPE) represents the superheat in the massecuite. The procedure for obtaining empirical correlations (2) and (3) is presented elsewhere (Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1993), nevertheless it is briefly described again in Appendix B. 3.3 Energy balance The energy balance is described by Eq. (4), where T m represents the temperature of massecuite. The enthalpy terms and specific heat capacities included are derived as functions of physical and thermodynamical properties, as given in Appendix A. (4) dTm dt =aJ cris +bFf+cJ vap +d, (4a) a= 1 M sol CPsol +McCPc × H sol −Hc+(1−B sol ) dH sol dB sol + 1−Pur sol B sol dH sol dPur sol , (4b) b= ρf M sol CPsol +McCPc × Hf−H sol +(Bf−B sol ) dH sol dB sol + Bf B sol (Pur f−Pur sol ) dH sol dPur sol , (4c) c= 1 M sol CPsol +McCPc H sol −H vap −B sol dH sol dB sol , (4d) d= 1 M sol CPsol +McCPc W+Q+Fwρw(Hw−H sol +B sol ) dH sol dB sol . 3.4 Population balance (in volume co-ordinates) The population balance represented by Eq. (5) below and the subsequent transformations leading to moment equations (10) are based on the theory published by Hulburt and Katz (1964) and Randolph and Larson (1988). This type of approach was also adopted by Tavare and Garside (1993) for a perfectly mixed crystalliser. Hulburt and Katz (1964) assume that particle birth is only due to collisional agglomeration and that both birth and death rates are function of the mass of colliding particles. The direct consequence of this concept is that population balances to include these agglomeration mechanisms should be written in terms of crystal volume density functions (i.e. related to mass) rather than linear size density functions. The population balance in volume co-ordinates is given by the following partial differential equation: (5) ∂ n ̃ (v) ∂t + ∂GV n ̃ (v) ∂v = B ̃ (v)− D ̃ (v), where n ̃ (v) is the number-volume distribution function and G V is the overall volume growth rate. As the total working volume of the fed-batch crystalliser is time varying, the population density and other relevant quantities will be defined on the basis of the total vessel volume at any time and denoted by ∼ over the corresponding symbol. The agglomeration mechanism is represented by empirical birth ( B ̃ (v)) and dead functions ( D ̃ (v)), respectively. The aggregation of two particles of volume u and v−u into a new particle of volume v is mathematically formulated by the rate of particle appearance: (6) B ̃ (v)= 1 2 β′ ∫ 0 v n ̃ (u) n ̃ (v−u) du and the rate of particle disappearance of volume v: (7) D ̃ (v)=β′ n ̃ (v) ∫ 0 ∞ n ̃ (v−u) du. The agglomeration kernel defined as (8) β=β′Vm is a measure of the frequency of collisions between particles of volumes u and v−u that are successful in producing a particle of volume v. It is assumed to be independent of the crystal volume, at least over a small time interval for parameter identification of the dynamic process. In case the agglomeration is not considered, the right-hand side of Eq. (5) is equal to zero. Defining the jth moment of a particle number-volume distribution function by (9) μj(v)= ∫ 0 ∞ vjn(v) dv and following the procedure developed by Hulburt and Katz (1964), the population balance Equation (5) is conveniently replaced for modelling purposes by the set of ordinary differential equations representing distribution moments in volume co-ordinates, as follows: (10) d μ ̃ j dt =Gv j μ ̃ j−1− n ̃ (v)vj ∞ 0 +β′ 1 2 ∑ k=0 j j k μ ̃ k μ ̃ j−k − μ ̃ 0 μ ̃ j ,j=0,1,2,… with initial and boundary conditions n ̃ (0,v)=0, n ̃ (t,∞)=0, n ̃ (t,0)= B ̃ 0/Gv . B ̃ 0 is the nucleation rate at near zero crystal volume and j k = j! k!(j−k)! is the binomial coefficient. For population balance modelling of the process in hand, the first four moments from Eq. (10) are derived as (11a) d μ ̃ 0 dt = B ̃ 0− 1 2 β′ μ ̃ 0 2, (11b) d μ ̃ 1 dt =Gv μ ̃ 0, (11c) d μ ̃ 2 dt =2Gv μ ̃ 1+β′ μ ̃ 1 2, (11d) d μ ̃ 3 dt =3Gv μ ̃ 2+3β′ μ ̃ 1 μ ̃ 2, with initial conditions μ ̃ j(0)=0, j=0,1,2,3. The zeroth and the first moment represent, respectively, total number and total volume of particles. Finally, the crystallisation rate is related to the derivative of the first moment as (12) J cris =ρc d μ ̃ 1 dt . Note that no definition is provided for nucleation, growth rate and aggregation, hence classifying the model written as a partial mechanistic model. Also, later in the text, in Section 6.4, the reason will be given of why moments of orders 2 and 3 are included in the model. 4 KBH model The kinetic parameters that reflect the crystallisation mechanism (Eqs. (11)) are the nucleation rate ( B ̃ 0), the agglomeration kernel (β′) and the linear growth rate (G), from which the overall volume growth rate is determined (13) Gv=3kv 1/3 v μ ̃ 0 2/3G. In the case of sugar crystallisation, the process variables that affect the kinetic parameters are rather well known. These variables are mainly temperature, supersaturation, purity of the solution and volume fraction of crystals, which is the ratio of the total volume in the pan and the volume of the crystals. Modelling of such phenomena is far from established and indeed a variety of empirical models of fuzzy accuracy are available and listed in the literature (Chorão & Feyo de Azevedo, 1996; Meireles & Feyo de Azevedo, 1998; Lauret, Boyer, & Gatina, 2000). Hence, instead of searching for an analytical expression of the kinetic parameters what is here proposed is to follow a KBH strategy that consists of complementing the prior physical knowledge formulated by the mass, energy and population balances with a neural network to model kinetic parameters, i.e. with the latter approach extracting knowledge hidden in the experimental data available (in case it is sufficient and reliable) for building the kinetic information required by the mechanistic model. To summarise, the KBH model of the sugar crystallisation process (Fig. 1a) consists of the set of algebraic–differential equations (1)–(4), (11)–(13), i.e. the mechanistic part, with an ANN representing the kinetic parameters (G, B ̃ 0,β′) in the framework of the overall process model, coupled with the correlations for the physical properties given in Appendix A. 5 Hybrid ANN training 5.1 Model structure and database construction The overall KBH model structure and related training scheme are represented in Fig. 1. The first decision to be made is on the network inputs to be chosen. It is known that the kinetic parameters are affected by the temperature (T m ), supersaturation (S), purity of the solution (Pursol) and volume fraction of crystals (υ c ). They all are considered as networks inputs. Except for the temperature, which is directly measurable, the other network inputs are function of mass balance states that are not directly measured (see the auxiliary correlations given in Appendix A). However, they can be reliably estimated based on the available measurements and simple computational algorithms (the so-called software sensors, see Feyo de Azevedo et al., 1993, 1994 for more details). Thus, supersaturation, purity of the solution and volume fraction of crystals are inferred from the estimated mass balance states and together with the physical measurements are saved in a large database for each of the available batches. On-line measurements with sampling time of 10 s are performed. Though the batches have approximately the same duration, they are not completely equal in time and consequently the data length per batch is variable. The network training is performed with a sequence of data points corresponding to the crystallisation and tightening phases (i.e. between 380 and 480 data points per batch) of eight batches. The other seven batches are used for testing and validation purposes. 5.2 Hybrid training procedure—sensitivity approach A typical problem arising in hybrid network modelling is that the usual training procedures for ANN are not applicable. The training of a neural network requires that the networks weights are determined in such a way that the sum of the squared error between the network output and the corresponding target output (available data) becomes minimal. In the hybrid system, however, the target outputs are not available since the kinetic parameters are not measured. Hence, a new training procedure must be developed. There are two approaches. The first one is to try to obtain some estimation of the network target output simply by applying interpolation techniques to the experimentally obtained data to get required time derivatives (Chen, Bernard, Bastin, & Angelov, 2000; Graefe et al., 1999). Then the network part is directly trained with its input and output data in the conventional way. The procedure is quite simple but usually suffers from low accuracy, particularly when the estimated output has a vivid time trajectory (as it is the case), or if the sampled data are noisy, asynchronous and with large time increments. A promising alternative is the sensitivity approach proposed by Psichogios and Ungar (1992) where the network output is propagated through the analytical part of the model. The predicted hybrid model output is compared with the available data. The error signal for updating the network parameters is a function of the observed error and the gradient of the hybrid model output with respect to the ANN output. The intuition behind the scheme is that the network parameters are changed proportionally to their effect on the prediction of the process output. This approach is applied for training of the present model. The hybrid network training can be performed in different ways depending on first principles knowledge involved. Taking into account that temperature measurements are available, the most straightforward way is to use only the energy balance equation to generate the error signal for network training. However, the sensitivity equations that have to be integrated are rather complex and difficult to formulate (see Eqs. (4)). Moreover, even if the gradients of the temperature with respect to the network outputs can be reliably computed, the training time would be considerably long. To use the whole set of mass balance equations for network training is another alternative but obviously the same problems arise, even stronger, due to the larger dimension of the analytical part involved. In fact, the aim is to get a reliable ANN model of the poorly known kinetic parameters while keeping the complexity of the network training as simple as possible. Therefore, a more practical way is to choose carefully only part of the mechanistic model, which is most directly influenced by the kinetic parameters. The mass of crystals is considered as most appropriate to serve as a target output in the hybrid network training. According to Eqs. (1d), (11b), (12) and (13), the mass balance of crystals can be rewritten as (14) dMc hyb dt =3(kvρc)1/3( μ ̃ 0 hyb )1/3(Mc hyb )2/3GNN. Eq. (14) is incorporated in the hybrid training structure but in order to integrate it the zero leading moment is also required and therefore its balance equation is also involved in the network training stage, (15) d μ ̃ 0 hyb dt =BNN− 1 2 βNN( μ ̃ 0 hyb )2. Superscripts hyb and NN are used to point out variables obtained during the hybrid network training. The training procedure is shown in Fig. 1b. The ANN is provided with normalised (between 0.1 and 0.9) data inputs, and the outputs of the network give estimates of the growth rate, nucleation and agglomeration kinetic parameters. After a denormalisation, these estimates are propagated through the analytical expression equations (14) and (15). The training database consists of 3520 points (corresponding to the crystallisation and tightening phases of eight process runs) for each of the inputs and for the target. Every iteration of the network training procedure includes the integration along time of balance equations (14) and (15) for each of the eight training runs, with the required resetting of initial conditions for each run. Neural network training is carried out in a batch mode, where the network parameters are updated only after complete processing of the whole training data set and related computing of the performance function. For each time point j of the training set, the predicted mass of crystals is compared with the target data to obtain the observed error (16) (ξ obs )j=(Mc obs )j−(Mc hyb )j,j=1,…,n, where n is the length of the training data. The corresponding error signal vector (E tr ) j is obtained by multiplying the observed error by the gradient of the hybrid model output with respect to the network outputs (17) (Etr)j=(ξ obs )j (λG)j (λB)j (λβ)j T ,j=1,…,n, where (18) (λG)j= ∂Mc hyb ∂G j,(λB)j= ∂Mc hyb ∂B j,(λβ)j= ∂Mc hyb ∂β j. A global matrix error signal E tr ={(e tr ) ij } is defined, where each scalar element (e tr ) ij corresponds to the error associated with the i network output and the j point of the training data sequence. Hence, the performance function to be minimised at each pass of training is the classical sum of squared errors (19) J= 1 3n ∑ i=1 3 ∑ j=1 n [(etr)ij]2. A modified version of the Levenberg–Marquardt optimisation algorithm is used for training and the network parameters are updated according to the scheme (20) wk+1=wk−[Q T Q+ξI]−1QEtr,Q= ∂Etr ∂w with w k being the vector of network parameters at the kth training iteration. At each epoch, the adaptive scalar value ξ is decreased if the performance function is reduced or it is increased when a tentative step increases the performance function (see Demuth & Beale, 1997 for more details). 5.3 Sensitivity equations The gradients, Equations (18), can be computed through integration of the sensitivity equations with zero initial conditions: (21a) dλG dt = ∂f2 ∂Mc hyb λB+ ∂f2 ∂G ,λG(0)=0, (21b) dλB dt = ∂f2 ∂Mc hyb λB+ ∂f2 ∂ μ ̃ 0 hyb ∂ μ ̃ 0 hyb ∂B ,λB(0)=0, (21c) dλβ dt = ∂f2 ∂Mc hyb λβ+ ∂f2 ∂ μ ̃ 0 hyb ∂ μ ̃ 0 hyb ∂β ,λβ(0)=0, where f 2 is the right-hand side of Eq. (14), (21d) f2=3(kvρc)1/3( μ ̃ 0 hyb )1/3(Mc hyb )2/3GNN. Note that while λ G can be obtained straightforward, λ B and λ β depend on the gradients of the zero moment with respect to B and β, respectively. In order to determine them the same strategy is used leading to integration of the following sensitivity equations with zero initial conditions (22a) dχB dt = ∂f1 ∂ μ ̃ 0 χB+ ∂f1 ∂B ,χB(0)=0, (22b) dχβ dt = ∂f1 ∂ μ ̃ 0 χβ+ ∂f1 ∂β ,χβ(0)=0, where f 1 is the right-hand side of Eq. (13), (22c) f1=BNN− 1 2 β ̂ NN( μ ̃ 0 hyb )2,χB= ∂ μ ̃ 0 ∂B ,χβ= ∂ μ ̃ 0 ∂β . To summarise, in order to get the gradients, Eqs. (18), and compute the training error signals, Eqs. (17), the following system of sensitivity differential equations has to be solved: (23a) dχB dt =1−βNN μ ̃ 0 hyb χB,χB(0)=0, (23b) dχβ dt =− μ ̃ 0 hyb (βNNχβ+0.5 μ ̃ 0 hyb ),χβ(0)=0, (23c) dλG dt =(kvρc μ ̃ 0 hyb )1/3 2(Mc hyb )−1/3GNNλG+3(Mc hyb )2/3 ,λG(0)=0, (23d) dλB dt =(kvρc)1/3GNN Mc hyb μ ̃ 0 hyb 2/3 2 Mc hyb μ ̃ 0 hyb −1λB+χB ,λB(0)=0, (23e) dλβ dt =(kvρc)1/3GNN Mc hyb μ ̃ 0 hyb 2/3 2 Mc hyb μ ̃ 0 hyb −1λβ+χβ ,λβ(0)=0. 6 Hybrid model performance and comparison with a complete mechanistic model In this section, the hybrid model is qualitatively compared with a complete mechanistic model of sugar crystallisation that was extensively studied and reported in previous works (Meireles & Feyo de Azevedo, 1998; Najim, Ruiz, Feyo de Azevedo, & Gonçalves, 1996). The performance of the two models is examined with respect to prediction quality of process outputs (temperature of massecuite and brix of solution) for which industrial data are available. Next, the final CSD computed by the two models is compared with the experimental crystal size distribution analysis at the end of the process run. 6.1 Empirical model for the kinetic parameters The mechanistic model consists of the same mass, energy and population balances, Eqs. (1)–(4), (11)–(13), with kinetic parameters given by the following empirical correlations: (24) G=Kg exp − 57000 R(Tm+273) (S−1)exp[−13.863(1−P sol )] 1+2 v Vm , (25) B ̃ 0=Kn×2.894×1012G0.51 μ ̃ 1 kvVm 0.53Vm, (26) β′=KagG μ ̃ 1 Vm 2 . K g , K n and K ag are kinetic constants, optimised on the basis of data from eight industrial runs following a classical non-linear least-squares regression. Their final values are given in Table 7. It has been proved that this model exhibits a superior performance when compared with a fully mechanistic model including nucleation and growth with dispersion but no agglomeration effects. Values of constant parameters required in both models are given in Table 8. 6.2 Results of the training phase Time trajectories of the process outputs T m and Bx sol are depicted on Fig. 2. They serve as direct indicators of the model quality since industrial data for them are present. Data are denoted by bold dash-dotted lines, the dashed lines correspond to the predicted values by the mechanistic model and by solid lines are depicted the same outputs computed by the hybrid model. The predictions of both models are similar and closely match the observed data. This is not surprising since data from the same batches was used for hybrid network training and for tuning the optimisation parameters in the empirical kinetic correlations (Eqs. (24)–(26)). The actual network in the framework of the hybrid model has one hidden layer with 10 activation functions of tansig type and the output layer has three activation functions of logsig type. This particular choice was achieved by starting with a large dimension hidden layer (25 nodes in this case) and reducing the number of the nodes gradually, down to the point where the performance function degradation is kept below 5%. Fig. 3 shows results of a new batch that is also used for hybrid network training, but now the optimisation constants of the mechanistic model are the same as those obtained from the previous batch (Batch 1). The hybrid model gives better predictions of Bx sol particularly in the rapid crystal growth phase (the period 20–70 min ). For this period, the kinetic parameters exhibit quite vivid non-linear dynamics and the ANN model (with 38 tuning parameters) succeeds in capturing such dynamics better than the empirical kinetic model (with three tuning parameters). In contrast to brix, the predictions of the two models with respect to T m are comparatively the same. The physical interpretation is that while the kinetic parameters are strongly influenced by temperature variations, the temperature itself is not substantially affected by the kinetic parameters. The same results are also observed at the validation stage. During the first phase of the batch cycle kinetic parameters can be taken as equal to zero since no crystals are introduced. For this reason, the hybrid network is trained only with data corresponding to the second and third phases and the plots of the figures start not at the beginning of the batch cycle but at the moment of concentration, which is different for each batch. 6.3 Model validation—analysis of process outputs along operation More important are results related to the generalisation properties of the two models. Once the training was over the network weights were frozen and tested on new (validation) batches. The kinetic constants of the mechanistic model were also kept as they were estimated by the previous batch (Batch 1). As seen from Figs. 4 and 5, the hybrid model clearly exhibits superior performance with respect to predictions of brix. Accurate prediction of this property is directly related to reliable computation of supersaturation (see Appendix A), which is the driving force for crystallisation. As for the temperature, both models present good extrapolation properties apart from the initial transient period (10–15 min ) before the temperature settles down. 6.4 Model validation—CSD predicted by the KBH model The quality of crystal size distribution is expressed at industrial level in terms of the norms approved by (International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis) (ICUMSA), i.e. by the MA and CV of the mass-size distribution function m(L). There are no techniques for (on-line) direct measurement of such parameters and generally data are limited to measurements made at the end of each batch by laboratory (sieve) analysis. Mathematically, the moments of the mass-size distribution are defined as (27) ηj(L)= ∫ 0 ∞ Ljm(L) dL,j=0,1,2,3,…, and the following formulas apply: (28) MA= L ̄ = ∫ 0 ∞ Lm(L) dL ∫ 0 ∞ m(L) dL, or equivalently (29) MA=η1/η0 and (30) CV=σ/ L ̄ , where (31) σ2= 1 η0 ∫ 0 ∞ (L− L ̄ )2m(L) dL. Hence, in terms of moments (32) CV=(η0η2/η1 2−1)1/2. Since in the model adopted (Eqs. (11)) the population balance is expressed as number-volume distribution moments, in order to account for the agglomeration mechanism, a relation between mass-size (η j (L)) and number-volume ( μ ̃ j(v)) distribution moments is required for the validation procedure. At this point it is relevant to recall the definitions and relationships between crystal mass-size distribution function (m(L)), number-volume distribution function (n(v)) and number-size distribution function (n(L)): (33) v=kvL3, (34) n(L) dL=n(v) dv, (35) m(L)=ρckvL3n(L)/Mc, where M c =ρ c μ 1(v) is the total crystal mass, with μ 1(v) representing the total volume of particles (Eq. (9)). Now, substituting Eqs. (33)–(35) into Eq. (27), a relation between η j (L) and μ j (v) is obtained as: (36) ηj(L)= 1 Mc ρc kv k−1 μk(v) ,k= j 3 +1,j=0,3,6,…. The recovering method adopted in this work is based on the assumption that the final sugar mass-size distribution can be reasonably well represented by a normal distribution function (Meireles & Feyo de Azevedo, 1998). According to Randolph and Larson (1988), the jth moment of a normal distribution (for any type of particle distribution function, but here applied to the mass-size distribution) can be defined as a function of the mean ( L ̄ ) and the variance (σ) of the distribution as follows: (37) ηj(L)= ∑ r (21/2σ)j−r( L ̄ )r j!.1.3…(j−r−1) (j−r)!r!2(j−r)/2 , where r=0,2,4,…,j for j even and r=1,3,5,…,j for j odd. Now, to compute L̄ and σ we make use of the third and the sixth mass-size distribution moments of Eq. (37), i.e. (37a) η3/ L ̄ 3=1+3 σ L ̄ 2, (37b) η6/ L ̄ 6=1+15 σ L ̄ 2+45 σ L ̄ 4+15 σ L ̄ 6. Let (38) X= σ L ̄ 2. Solving together Eqs. (37a), (37b) and (38) leads to (39) L ̄ = η3 1+3X 1/3 and (40) 15η3 2X3+(45η3 2−9η6)X2+(15η3 2−6η6)X+η3 2−η6=0. Numerical computation will then go through the following steps: (a) For a given set of number-volume moments μ ̃ k(v), η 3(L) and η 6(L) are obtained from Eq. (36). (b) The roots (only positive X) of polynomial equation (40) are computed. (c) L̄ follows from Eq. (39). (d) Finally, a model-based estimation of MA and CV from Eqs. (28) and (30) is computed. MA and CV predicted by the mechanistic and the hybrid models following the above procedure are compared with the experimental data available at the end of eight (validation) batches. The results, summarised in Table 9, confirm the practical advantage of the hybrid model. Table 9 and the process output predictions indicate that introduction of knowledge from different sources (first principle model and available data record for the process investigated here) can be effectively combined to obtain an improved sugar crystallisation model. The hybrid model obtained seems to posses the advantages of both fully analytical and fully data-driven modelling approaches without being too time-consuming and expensive procedure. 7 Conclusions The difficulty in crystallisation modelling is essentially on the accurate description of the CSD with the respective quantities—MA and CV. The experience with models neglecting agglomeration and/or nucleation mechanisms shows that the CSD predictions do not correspond to the experimentally obtained MA and CV at the end of the process run. Therefore, accurate modelling can only be achieved by incorporating agglomeration and nucleation mechanisms. In this paper, a KBH model of a sugar crystallisation process when accounting for nucleation, growth and agglomeration phenomena is developed and examined. The concept of serial hybrid modelling is adopted where only the poorly known kinetic parameters (nucleation rate, growth rate, agglomeration kernel) are replaced by a feedforward ANN. This black-box approximation is incorporated in the structure of the classical mechanistic model reflecting the mass, energy and population balances. The KBH model demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data available. The hybrid modelling offers a reasonable compromise between the extensive efforts to get a fully parameterised structure, as are the mechanistic models and the poor generalisation of the complete data-based modelling approaches. A reliable description of the kinetic parameters is of special importance not only for the academic understanding of the crystallisation phenomena, but also for the purposes of optimising the manipulated input time profiles, with the objective to obtain sugar crystals with desired quality characteristics.

Appendix B Empirical model for the evaporation rate In industrial applications there are a number of unknowns, which hamper the use of pure theoretical considerations in the modelling of heat fluxes. It is the case of unquantifiable heat losses all over the unit, of the unreliable measurements of steam heat contents and of the inaccurate expressions available to represent evaporation rates. A possible way to cope with such type of problems is to consider empirical correction factors on the theoretical relationships, with parameters tuned by experiment. Hence, the first empirical parameter is introduced in the heat input, Q, given by (A.1) Q=αsFs ΔHs. α s may be interpreted as a corrective term of the heating steam enthalpy, which includes heat losses and errors in the steam flow and pressure sensors. Experimental data for the estimation of α s is collected from the concentration period, when no crystals are present in the pan and the input fluxes are closed (Ff=0,Fw=0). During this phase the energy balance equations (4) simplify to (A.2) dTm dt =cJ vap +d with (A.2a) c= 1 M sol CPsol H sol −H vap −B sol dH sol dB sol ,d= 1 M sol CPsol [W+Q]. During this period, it is possible to calculate the mass of evaporated water, solving (A.2) with respect to J vap: (A.3) J vap = W+Q−M sol CPsol (dTm/dt) H vap −(H sol −B sol (dH sol /dB sol )) . The integral of J vap over the concentration period is obtained by material balance, employing the experimental brix of solution. Consequently, the integration of Eq. (A.3) over the same period leads to the analytical solution for α s since all other terms and parameters are known either from theoretical or experimental data. In a second stage, an alternative expression of J vap is obtained by taking the practical view that the evaporation rate should include the effect of an existing superheat in the massecuite (Batterham & Norgate, 1975), expressed in terms of the temperature difference (T m −T w(vac)−BPE). The simplified form for J vap can be written as (A.4) J vap = W+Q λw(vac) +k vap (Tm−Tw(vac)−BPE). Identically to the calculation of α s , the empirical parameter k vap is obtained from the analytical solution of the integral of Eq. (A.4) over the concentration period. The optimised values for α s and k vap obtained by the analysis of experimental data taken from nine batches in different days are reported in Table 8. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of mass of water in solution, comparing the experimental profile with those obtained by employing Eq. (A.3), considered as a theoretical model, and Eq. (A.4), adopted as the empirical correlation, for the evaporation rate in the overall crystallisation model (see Eq. (3)). The values for the empirical parameters are taken from Table 8 and dTm dt in Eq. (A.3) is approximated by ΔTm Δt , with Δt=10 s . References Batterham and Norgate 1975 R.J. Batterham T.E.

        "doc_abstract": "In this article a task-oriented neural network (NN) solution is proposed for the problem of article recovering real process outputs from available distorted measurements. It is shown that a neural network can be used as approximator of inverted first-order measurement dynamics with and without time delay. The trained NN is connected in series with the sensor, resulting in an identity mapping between the inputs and the outputs of the composed system. In this way the network acts as a software mechanism to compensate for the existing dynamics of the whole measurement system and recover the actual process output. For those cases where changes in the measurement system occur, a multiple concurrent-NN recovering scheme is proposed. This requires a periodical path-finding calibration to be performed. A procedure for such a calibration purpose has also been developed, implemented, and tested. It is shown that it brings adequate robustness to the overall compensation scheme. Results showing the performance of both the NN compensator and the calibration procedure are presented for closed loop system operation.",

        "doc_abstract": "© 2002 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.Industrial evolution in the second half of the twentieth century was influenced mostly by four types of interrelated factors: progress in digital technology, advances in science, evolution of societal requirements and demands and, particularly over the last 30 years, evolution of business concepts.Developments in digital technology and in systems theory led to major progress in sensor and information technology and a revolution in the availability of distributed control systems and open software applications. New concepts, particularly knowledge-based measurement and advanced control methodologies, are slowly but steadily being brought into the practice of process operation, performing online and in real time.Societal and economic factors have driven evolution in the same direction. The increasing concern for health, safety and sustainability issues, market quality requirements, economic pressure and the evolution of company strategy from local to global business concepts - the so-called knowledge economy concepts - all together reflected on plant investment decisions, favoring process automation for cleaner and safer operation, higher product quality and improved process efficiency and productivity.Discussing plant automation from a technical point of view means a discussion on instrumentation, control system configurations, data communications and theoretical control structures.This article deals with instrumentation, addressing in particular both basic and advanced concepts concerning sensors and the issue of how to integrate local hardware for automatic control, usually dispersed throughout the plant.",

        "doc_abstract": "An adaptive controller for activated sludge processes is introduced. The control objective is to keep, in the presence of input constraints, the concentration of the biomass proportional to the influent flow rate, where a prespecified small tracking error of size λ is tolerated. This is achieved by the so called λ-tracker which is simple in its design, relies only on structural properties of the process and weak feasibility properties, and does not invoke any estimation or identification mechanism or probing signals. λ-Tracking is proved for a model of an activated sludge process with unknown reaction kinetics and including unknown time-varying process parameters. It is illustrated by simulations that the λ-tracker works successfully, and even under practical circumstances which go beyond what we can prove mathematically, it can cope with 'white noise' corrupting the measurement and periodically acting disturbances.",

        "doc_abstract": "A biotechnological aerobic process is modelled as an ordinary differential equation which, under mild assumptions, ensures invariance of the positive orthant and boundedness of the concentrations. An adaptive controller is designed for this general class of processes so that the external substrate can be regulated by the dilution rate into a prespecified arbitrarily small neighbourhood of a constant setpoint reference. The adaptive controller is robust, simple in its design without invoking any identification mechanisms, and is based on output data only. It is shown that the prominent example of a baker's yeast fermentation belongs to this setup, and adaptive tracking is illustrated by simulations. © 2001 EUCA.",

A biotechnological aerobic process is modelled as an ordinary differential equation which, under mild assumptions, ensures invariance of the positive orthant and boundedness of the concentrations. An adaptive controller is designed for this general class of processes so that the external substrate can be regulated by the dilution rate into a prespecified arbitrarily small neighbourhood of a constant setpoint reference. The adaptive controller is robust, simple in its design without invoking any identification mechanisms, and is based on output data only. It is shown that the prominent example of a baker's yeast fermentation belongs to this setup, and adaptive tracking is illustrated by simulations.

Therefore, the dynamical behavior of the non-linear plant is suitably approximated by linear state-space model with bounded parameter variations. The control problem considered is to guarantee robust stability and robust performance of the closed loop system. The performance specifications are defined through weighting functions.

In operational terms, the objective is to conduct the process imposing that the biomass concentration in the recycle stream follows closely a time-varying, process-dependent, reference signal. The corresponding control objective is described as the development of a robust reference-tracking control structure with the best possible disturbance compensation, able to perform with noisy measurements and able to cope with variations in key process model parameters. The proposed algorithm embeds an estimation of states by solving the Riccati equation and avoids parameter estimation by assuming their variability within known bounds. Results are presented which show a favourable behaviour of the robust controller in comparison with a conventional PI control structure.",

Therefore, a linearized process model in the state-space is used whose elements are supposed to vary within certain bounds to represent the nonlinear behaviour of the real plant.

We offer an interpretation based on the nonlinear magnetodiode effect that generates an additional angle-dependent potential and increases the potential barriers of the two directly connected collectors. As a result, angle dependence of the p+-n junction resistances is observed that modulates the current between the collectors. The absence of the new effect after a certain value of the temperature T0, T > T0 is due to the decrease of carrier mobility leading to linearity of the galvanomagnetic process in the microsensor.",

        "doc_abstract": "One of the fundamental problems in the advanced control system design is the uncertainty in the model description. Moreover, multivariable systems have complementary difficulty because of the interaction effects between different control loops. In this case the regulator requirements are complicated. The paper presents frequency - domain approach to design robust regulator when the detailed plant model is replaced by suitable approximate one. The difference between the step responses of the plant and the approximate model is used to present the measure of plant uncertainty. As a result the conditions are defined which guarantee the stability of the real system despite the existing uncertainties.",
