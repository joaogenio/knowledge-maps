Several measures of dissimilarity between distance distributions are considered, and it is found that the peak dissimilarity works best in this setting. We report the existence of reverse complementary word pairs with very dissimilar distance distributions, as well as word pairs with very similar distance distributions even when both distributions are irregular and contain strong peaks. The association between distribution dissimilarity and frequency discrepancy is also explored, and it is speculated that symmetric pairs combining low and high values of each measure may uncover features of interest. Taken together, our results suggest that some asymmetries in the human genome go far beyond Chargaff’s rules. This study uses both the complete human genome and its repeat-masked version.",

For this purpose, we developed new procedures to identify symmetric word pairs with uncommon empirical distance distribution and with clusters of overrepresented short distances. We speculate that patterns of overrepresentation of short distances between symmetric word pairs may allow the occurrence of non-standard DNA conformations, such as hairpin/cruciform structures. We focused on the human genome, and analysed both the complete genome as well as a version with known repetitive sequences masked out. We reported several well-defined features in the distributions of distances, which can be classified into three different profiles, showing enrichment in distinct distance ranges. We analysed in greater detail certain pairs of symmetric words of length seven, found by our procedure, characterised by the surprising fact that they occur at single distances more frequently than expected.",

It is a somewhat broadly defined concept, which has been refined into some more specific measurable effects. Here we discuss the exceptional symmetry effect. Exceptional symmetry is the symmetry effect beyond that expected in independence contexts, and it can be measured for each word, for each equivalent composition group, or globally, combining the effects of all possible words of a given length. Global exceptional symmetry was found in several species, but there are genomic words with no exceptional symmetry effect, whereas others show a very high exceptional symmetry effect. In this work, we discuss a measure to evaluate the exceptional symmetry effect by symmetric word pair, and compare it with others. We present a detailed study of the exceptional symmetry by symmetric pairs and take the CG content into account.

However, parity of the frequencies of reverse complementary oligonucleotides could be a mere consequence of the single nucleotide parity rule, if nucleotide independence is assumed. Exceptional symmetry (symmetry beyond that expected under an independent nucleotide assumption) was proposed previously as a meaningful measure of the extension of the second parity rule to oligonucleotides. The global exceptional symmetry was detected in long and short genomes. Results: To explore the exceptional genomic word symmetry along the genome sequences, we propose a sliding window method to extract the values of exceptional symmetry (for all words or by word groups). We compare the exceptional symmetry effect size distribution in all human chromosomes against control scenarios (positive and negative controls), testing the differences and performing a residual analysis. We explore local exceptional symmetry in equivalent composition word groups, and find that the behaviour of the local exceptional symmetry depends on the word group. Conclusions: We conclude that the exceptional symmetry is a local phenomenon in genome sequences, with distinct characteristics along the sequence of each chromosome. The local exceptional symmetry along the genomic sequences shows outlying segments, and those segments have high biological annotation density.",

        "doc_abstract": "© The authors 2016.Context Forest management has impacts on bats worldwide. Given that many forest bats are threatened and that bats are important providers of ecosystem services, understanding the effects of forest management practices on their activity is fundamental for the implementation of conservation measures. Despite these important issues, studies on the effects of management practices on bats are scarce. Aims To propose management measures for coniferous production forests, to ensure sustainability of bat populations. Methods We evaluated bat species richness and activity during gestation, lactation and mating/swarming/dispersion seasons in differently managed pine stands to evaluate how vegetation structure influences those variables. Bat activity was surveyed using acoustic monitoring in 28 sampling plots within stands with distinct management records in Portugal. We also sampled arthropods using light traps to ascertain how prey availability influenced bat species richness and activity in those plots. Key results Bat species richness and activity varied along the three phenological seasons and were higher in autumn, when mating, swarming and dispersion from nurseries to hibernacula took place. Prey availability varied, but was higher during the lactation season. We hypothesise that the lower levels of bat species richness and activity registered during that period were due to a reduced availability of roosts, rather than food scarcity. Species richness was positively correlated with canopy cover and prey taxa richness, and negatively associated with dry branches cover. Total bat activity was positively correlated with tree height and prey taxa richness, and negatively associated with dry branches cover. The activity of edge-space foragers was positively associated with average tree height and prey taxa richness, while the activity of open-space foragers was negatively associated with dry branches cover. Conclusions Coniferous production forests are of great importance for bats during the mating/swarming/dispersion season. Canopy cover, dry branches cover, tree height and prey taxa richness influence bat species richness and activity as a whole, particularly the activity of open- and edge- foraging guilds. Implications Based on our results, two straightforward management actions should be implemented in coniferous production forests to increase their value for bat assemblages: the maintenance of old coniferous stands, and the cutting of dry branches at the subcanopy level.",

The simulator can handle the multiple reflections present in a room, which could be produced by the room walls and by the objects inside it. Moreover, it takes into account the transducer’s beam patterns as well as the ultrasonic wave propagation losses. Additionally the simulator may be used to simulate the Doppler effect for any type of movement. The simulator was implemented using Matlab and is freely available, so that it can be easily modified by the user. Field tests have shown that the simulator is very accurate, turning it into a valuable tool to study and compare different ultrasonic pulses or ultrasonic location systems under controlled conditions. Keywords Ultrasonic signals Acoustic simulator Impulse response Ultrasonic reflection Doppler effect 1 Introduction An ultrasonic (US) room simulator is a valuable tool to study and compare the performance of different location algorithms and acoustic pulses in a controlled environment. By using a simulator it is very easy to change the parameters that affect the response of the acoustic system and to test extreme situations that are not easy to replicate in the real field. Moreover, it is much faster to use a simulator than to setup and carry out real field tests in order to test different algorithms and ultrasonic signals under the same circumstances. Commercially available acoustic simulators, like Ramsete, ODEON or CATT-Acoustic, are very expensive and complex and since they are not open source, changes are not possible [1]. However, there are examples of freely available simulators, [2–4] but they are implemented to simulate very specific situations, most of them in the audible range. Moreover, the majority of them do not take into account the Doppler effect or implement it for very simple situations such as uniform movement. Note that the Doppler effect has a considerably stronger impact on US signals than on radio-frequency (RF), as it will be seen in Section 5. Indoor ultrasonic acoustic propagation presents problems similar to those experienced in electromagnetic waves propagation, such as multiple reflections, Doppler effect and propagation attenuation [4,5]. Due to these problems, a good model for the ultrasonic channel is needed in order to properly design ultrasonic communication or location systems. The proposed simulator is based on changing and simplifying some techniques that were used in the acoustics and radio-frequency fields. The approach presented here allows to produce a very fast and easy to use simulator to evaluate and compare different ultrasonic location systems and ultrasonic communication pulses. 2 Simulator architecture The problem that we want to address is schematically presented in Fig. 1 . Each source s receives an electric signal x s ( n ) and transforms it into an acoustic wave that travels through the Room Channel. Moreover, this Room Channel represents a room where the acoustic waves can propagate and reflect in the walls before arriving at the receiver position. Therefore, the receiver block combines each received wave into the signal y ( n ) . The simulator architecture can be represented by the block diagram of Fig. 2 , where h s ( n ) represents the impulse response (IR) that simulates the effect of the transducer and the acoustic channel on the input signal x s ( n ) . This approach brings the first two simplifications to the models to be used in the simulator: 1. all signals are digital and therefore discrete (time and value); 2. the source, the receiver and the room effects are considered linear (represented by an IR). At the end the simulator provides to the user the IRs for each individual source s , h s ( n ) . The user may compute a set of impulse responses at different receiver’s positions and compare the effect of each source and input signal x s ( n ) in the received signal y ( n ) . Each h s ( n ) can be decomposed in three main IRs which represent the effect of the source, t s ( n ) , the receiver, r s ( n ) , and the sound propagation, p s ( n ) , see Fig. 3 . The source s IR, t s ( n ) , models the effect of the transmission chain (sound card; cables; amplifier; speaker; etc.), in other words, it models all the path from the digital world up to the acoustic wave generated by the speaker. In contrast, the receiver IR, r s ( n ) , models the effect of the reception chain (microphone; amplifier; cables; sound card; etc.), in other words, it simulates the path from the received acoustic wave by the microphone up to the digital world. Finally, the sound propagation IR, p s ( n ) , models the acoustic wave propagation in a specific room for a pair of receiver and source positions (attenuation; distance delay; etc). 2.1 Transmitter/receiver model In order to obtain the source and the receiver IR two approaches can be employed. If the hardware manufacturer gives the IR (or frequency response) of their components, then it will be possible to obtain the IR for all the chain. If not, measuring the IR of the system with calibrated hardware could be the only way. Note that, for a complete hardware description (e.g.: speaker and microphone) IR measures for each azimuth and elevation angle must be obtained. However, this needs to be carried out just once because the measured IR are considered to be independent of the room conditions. Both IR must be provided to the simulator, a source IR for a given source output direction and a receiver IR for a given receiver input direction. The receiver or the source direction is defined by the azimuth angle θ, and the elevation angle ϕ as presented in Fig. 4 . 2.2 Sound propagation model This is the most crucial element of the simulator. However, it is not possible to measure the IR for all the ambient conditions and for all possible source/receiver distances, being impractical to model the sound propagation by applying the same approach used for the source and the receiver. Therefore, the proposed simulator, uses a physic based model instead of a statistically based model [1,6,7]. In contrast to the statistically based models the physic based models allow to simulate the behavior of a system in a particular room or in a particular situation. In order to reduce the simulation time and the user intervention some approximations and simplifications were made in the sound propagation model, wherever possible, without compromising the closeness to reality. On that account, the simulator incorporates the following simplifications and specifications, that will be detailed later: 1. The room ambient conditions (temperature, pressure and humidity) are constant over time and space. 2. The wave propagation attenuates due only to dispersion and energy absorption and it is considered to be a function of the signal frequency. 3. The wind effect and the gradients of temperature were not taken into account. The sound speed, c, depends on temperature, pressure and density of the air [8]. Nevertheless, at typical room conditions, the sound speed may be assumed to be independent of small pressure and density variations [8]. Therefore, c can be written only as a function of the temperature: (1) c = 331.5641 T 273.15 + 1 (m/s) where T is the air temperature in °C. This speed implies that the ultrasonic wave takes some time to travel the distance, d, from the source up to the receiver. Due to the need to accurately simulate this delay, the input signal x s ( n ) may need to be delayed by a non integer number of sampling periods. For that reason, Lagrange fractional delay filters [9] were used to simulate the fractional delay. The choice of this particular type of filters relies on the fact that they produce a finite IR, L D ( n ) , that can be easily integrated with the other IRs of the simulator. Furthermore, they were also chosen because their filter coefficients can be readily updated by a close-form equation [9] given by: (2) L D ( n ) = ∏ m = 0 m ≠ n M D - m n - m , where D is a real number that represents the filter delay and M the filter order. Lagrange fractional delay filters only operate properly for frequencies up to a quarter or a third of the sampling frequency, depending on the filter order, which can be pointed out as the main Lagrange fractional delay filter’s disadvantage [9]. For that reason, the simulator must use a sampling rate around four times higher than the maximum frequency of the signal in order to reduce the delay and amplitude errors. Considering that the majority of the ultrasonic transducers manufacturers only provide the pressure amplitude, P 0 , at a certain known distance d 0 and ultrasonic waves propagate as spherical waves [8], as shown in Fig. 5 , the pressure amplitude at distance d (in meters) relates with P 0 as: (3) P ( d ) = d 0 d × P 0 . This equation only takes into account the wave attenuation due to dispersion. However, in [10], it is pointed out that the propagation losses in ultrasonic frequencies have a strong impact in the wave attenuation, especially for distances above a few meters. This attenuation can be expressed as [10]: (4) P ( d ) = P 0 × 10 - α ( d - d 0 ) 20 where α is the air absorption coefficient in dB/m and it can be computed by the 9613-1 ISO norm [11] using only parameters easily obtained, such as, the temperature, the pressure, frequency and relative humidity. Combining the attenuation due to dispersion (3) and due to propagation losses (4), the resultant acoustic wave pressure amplitude at distance d (in meters) is given by: (5) P ( d ) = P 0 × d 0 d × 10 - α ( d - d 0 ) 20 . As the result of considering that the room ambient conditions are constant over the simulation, the absorption coefficient in air is only a function of the wave frequency f. Therefore, the atmospheric attenuation faced by an ultrasonic wave at d meters from the source is given by: (6) A T ( d , f ) = d 0 d × 10 - α ( f ) ( d - d 0 ) 20 As a result of this, the A T ( d , f ) will be only a function of the wave frequency f for a fixed distance d and therefore can be considered as a linear filter, which results into an impulse response, a ( n ) . To exemplify the process used in the simulator to obtain the impulse response a ( n ) , a receiver at 4m from the source and the following ambient conditions: a temperature of 20°C; a relative humidity of 30%; and a pressure of 1atm was considered. Under this constraints the total attenuation in air, A T ( 4 , f ) , is depicted in Fig. 6 . Our approach to obtain the A T ( d , f ) IR is to use the inverse Fourier transform. Which leads us to an infinite impulse response. Therefore, the resultant IR must be truncated in order to obtain an IR with only a few samples. Fig. 7 presents the IR with 64 samples obtained by this process for the example presented in Fig. 6, it also shows the error produced in the frequency domain. Note that this IR must be delayed due to causality however this delay can be easily subtracted from the total delay resulted from propagation (in this example the IR must be delayed of 32 samples which represents a distance of around 5.5cm for a sampling frequency of 200kHz). We can see in Fig. 7b that the resultant error is very low, moreover it can be considerably reduced by increasing the IR length. However, this approach will increase the minimum distance between the source and the receiver that can be simulated. Nevertheless, the error can be reduced if we discard the frequency response accuracy in some of the frequency components, for example in the audible range (up to 20kHz). In order to increase the accuracy of the frequency response in one part of the spectrum while giving up elsewhere, we can use the algorithm presented in Fig. 8 based on the Papoulis–Gerchberg algorithm [12,13]. The algorithm starts by computing the total attenuation frequency response A T ( d , f ) using (6) in K frequency points f k , obtaining the discrete Fourier transform A ( k ) , Note that, the frequency points f k must be computed for the discrete Fourier transform bins, moreover the number of frequency points K must be greater than the desired IR length L to ensure proper frequency response interpolation. After that, the IR a i ( n ) is computed by the inverse discrete Fourier transform of A i ( k ) , resulting into a length K IR. The IR a i ( n ) is then truncated using a rectangular window w L ( n ) with length L and the corresponding frequency response is computed using the discrete Fourier transform. This process is repeated until the error in the desired band B is less than a given value ∊. At the beginning of each iteration the frequency points in the desired band B of A i ( k ) are restored to the proper values A ( B ) . By using the proposed algorithm it is possible to considerably reduce the error for a predetermined band. Using the same example and applying the algorithm to the band from 20kHz to 50kHz and running it one hundred times, it is possible to increase the accuracy of the total attenuation frequency response ten times for the same IR length (see Fig. 9 ). 2.3 Surfaces model For the surface modeling (e.g.: walls, floor and objects) the simulator uses a polygonal based modeling, widely used in 3D computer graphics [14]. Due to the typical geometric shape of the room surfaces we chose quadrilaterals instead of the conventional triangles as the basic element. Therefore, most of the room surfaces can be represented by making use of only one quadrilateral. However, some of them must be represented has a group of quadrilaterals connected to each other to form a particular geometric shape. Furthermore, many of the room models produced by specific software are based in polygonal modeling which may be easily adapted to be used into the simulator. Nevertheless, this type of geometry considerably simplifies the process of computing the surface reflections. However, to properly model curved surfaces, it is necessary to use a huge number of quadrilaterals. 2.4 Multiple reflections model At this point, it is possible to model the transmission, propagation and reception chain using separate impulse responses and without considering the reflections. As a result of this, it is already possible to properly model the direct path from the sent signal x s ( n ) to the received signal y s ( n ) . Moreover, it is also possible to represent all the surfaces in the room that may produce wave reflections. Therefore, all the main requirements to introduce the reflections into the simulator are fulfilled. However, the theory of sound propagation in closed spaces can be very hard to apply and model and it may bring an important drawback associated to it: the computation time. Nevertheless, ultrasonic waves have a huge advantage when compared to sound, which is that its maximum wave length is about 1.7cm (for 20kHz). As most of the obstacles usually present in a room are larger that this wavelength, we can consider only specular reflections. Moreover, the ultrasonic scattering energy is very low when compared to scattering energy in the audible range. Due to its complexity, it was also discarded by the simulator. These simplifications considerably reduce the simulation time and the user intervention without compromising the closeness to reality. On that account, the simulator presents the following characteristics and specifications: 1. It is considered that the sound will propagate along sound rays. 2. All possible reflections up to a predefined order are computed and they are considered to be only specular in a plane surface with a specific IR (previously measured) associated to it. Diffraction and scattering are ignored due to its modeling and computational complexity. 3. All the possible received sound rays are subsequently validated by applying the ray-tracing method. When an ultrasonic wave is emitted in a common room, the wave travels radially in all directions. When this wave finds an obstacle (e.g. a wall), the propagation direction changes and the ultrasonic wave reflects on the obstacle [8]. However to simulate the ultrasonic propagation it is better to consider that it travels like rays and the wave front is flat [15]. In other words, the ultrasonic wave behaves, in the presence of an object, as a ray of light behaves in the presence of a mirror. This means that it is possible to apply the well known Snell Law, from the optics theory, to determine the reflection wave direction (7) θ i = θ r . It is important to notice that, in the simulator, the transmitted wave is discarded due to its low energy, therefore it is considered that the transmitted wave is completely absorbed by the object [15]. For most of the solid materials (e.g. wood, metal, plastic, glass, etc.) the reflected wave has almost the same energy as the incident wave. Nevertheless, some soft materials in a common room can absorb some wave energy and consequently the reflected wave has less energy than the incident wave (e.g. carpets, cork, curtains, etc.). In addiction to these, if the energy lost in the reflection depends on the frequency of the incident wave, an IR of the wall reflection must be considered. Nevertheless, similar to what happens with the source and the receiver, this has to be carried out only once and it is considered to be independent of the room conditions. In order to model the reflection in the surfaces there are two classical geometric methods: the Ray Tracing Method and the Image Source Method [16]. In both methods, the accuracy increases as the frequency increases and they present very good results for high audible frequencies [16]. Therefore, at the ultrasonic range it is expected that they produce very accurate results. An hybrid method that combines the Ray-Tracing Method and the Virtual Sources Method was used in the simulator. Firstly, all the virtual sources are created and then each incoming ray is validated by using the ray-tracing method. 3 Implementation The implementation of the simulator was carried out in Matlab. 1 Matlab is a numerical computing environment developed by MathWorks, it allows the implementation of complex algorithms providing several tools to reduce the implementation time. 1 Since Matlab is proprietary software an effort was made, during the simulator implementation, to only use typical Matlab functions that can be found in several compatible freeware packages (such as GNU Octave 2 GNU Octave is a freeware software very similar to Matlab and most of the algorithms implemented in Matlab can be run in GNU Octave without almost any changes. 2 ). This way, the implemented simulator can be used almost for free. Moreover, this tool will allow the user to have complete control over the simulation and to understand its behavior. The simulator was implemented as a modular program in order to simplify the implementation of future extensions and the substitution of code by any user. The modular structure allows the user to easily modify any module in order to obtain the desired behavior. The simulator can be divided into six different modules and six different methods for interaction between the modules. A module can be a simple data structure or a complex object depending on its goal. The methods are designed to obtain the information from the modules and/or create new modules. The interaction between the different modules and methods is schematically represented in Fig. 10 . 3.1 Walls array module The Walls_Array module is a simple data structure that contains the information of each surface of the room. Each surface in the array is represented by a reflection coefficient and by the four edges of the quadrilateral as discussed previously in Section 2.4. This module is created and modified by the Add_Wall method, which creates the array and fills it with the data. 3.2 Transfer function module The Transfer_Func module is an object that, for a particular source or receiver, outputs to the user the IR for a given azimuth and elevation angle. Depending on the origin of the information this module can have different implementations, however, this must me transparent to the user. In the present simulator implementation, this module needs three inputs: – the direction: ( θ , ϕ ) ; – the operation frequency band: B ; – the sampling frequency: f s . From these inputs the module provides two outputs: – the impulse response: t s ( n ) or r s ( n ) ; – the index of the IR’s first sample. This module is used by the Add_Source and Add_Receiver methods. 3.3 Sources array module The Sources_Array module is a simple data structure that contains the information of each source placed in the room. Each source in the array is represented by: – the position in the room ( x , y , z ) coordinates; – the direction in Cartesian coordinates ( e x , e y , e z ); – the Transfer_Func module associated to the source. This module is created and modified by the Add_Source method, which creates the array and fills it with the data. 3.4 Room representation file module The Room_File module is a simple data structure stored in a file that contains: – the information of all the room surfaces; – all the sources in the room (real and virtual). This module is created by the Get_Room method, which by processing the Walls_Array and the Sources_Array modules can create the file and fill it with the data for a maximum reflection order given by the user. This module has a specific method to show graphically the information stored in the file: the Display_Room method. Fig. 11 presents two example outputs of this method. In Fig. 11a the room without reflections is presented and therefore only the real source marked with a circle is shown. Fig. 11b presents the same example but considering a maximum of three successive reflections. The virtual sources, that produce the reflections are marked with a light gray circles and the real source with a dark gray circle. Note that, this file is independent of the room ambient conditions and the receiver position. Therefore, the resultant file can be used for any room ambient conditions and for any receiver position without the need to create it again. 3.5 Receiver module The Receiver module is similar to the Sources_Array module. The biggest difference is that it only has one receiver instead of having an array of them. Therefore, the data structure contains: – the position in the room ( x , y , z ) coordinates; – the direction in Cartesian coordinates ( e x , e y , e y ); – the receiver Transfer_Func module. This module has a creator method, Add_Receiver, which creates it and fills it with the data. 3.6 Propagation module The Propagation module is an object that for particular ambient conditions provides the user with the IR for a given distance between the source and the receiver. This IR only takes into account the ultrasonic wave attenuation presented in Section 2.2. In the present simulator, the implementation of this module needs the following inputs: – the distance between the source and the receiver; – the room temperature, humidity and pressure; – the operation frequency band, B ; – the sampling frequency, f s . From these inputs the module provides the following outputs: – the impulse response, a ( n ) ; – the index of the IR’s first sample (causality problem). 3.7 Get impulse response method The Get_Impulse method is the most complex method in the simulator due to the fact that it collects and combines all the information from other modules (Room_File, Receiver and Propagation) to compute the IR from each source, h s ( n ) . In the first stage, by using the Receiver module, it validates all the sources (real and virtual) in the Room_File module. For each valid source, it obtains the source output direction and the receiver input direction. It computes the total attenuation due the reflection coefficient of each surface and the total traveling distance. In the second stage, it computes the IR from the Transfer_Func module of the source, t s ( n ) , the IR from the Transfer_Func module of the receiver, r s ( n ) , and the IR from the Propagation module, a ( n ) . At the end it groups together all the sources that represent the same real source and computes the resultant impulse response for each real source, h s ( n ) . 4 Performance To evaluate the simulator performance several simulations were carried out, in the same computer, with different parameters. For these tests a computer with the characteristics presented in Table 1 was used. In order to minimize external interference from other programs running in the computer, the Matlab process priority was set to High. In addition to this, at least 10 trials were carried out for each test. 4.1 Room complexity impact In this test, the simulation time was measured using one to twelve surfaces and considering a maximum of one to five successive reflections. The simulation times are presented in Fig. 12 . From this figure it can be seen that the simulation time is approximately exponential with the number of surfaces (>3) in the room for any number of maximum successive reflections. Considering three maximum successive reflections the simulation time starts at about 2ms for three surfaces and goes up to 50ms. Another important point is that the simulation time increases considerably with the maximum number of successive reflections. It starts around 2ms for one reflection and ends at 20s for five reflections for a room with twelve surfaces. Nevertheless, for the majority of the ultrasonic applications, a maximum of three or four successive reflections is more than enough to present good results. 4.2 Number of sources impact In this test, the simulation time was measured using one to three sources and considering a maximum successive reflection number of one to six. The results from this test are presented in Fig. 13 . From this figure it can be seen that the simulation time is approximately exponential with the number of reflections and is approximately linear with the number of sources. These results are consistent with the previous test and the simulator implementation, where each source is treated separately and independently. 5 Simulating the Doppler effect The Doppler effect is produced by the receiver and/or source movement. Moreover, the Doppler effect can be characterized by a compression or expansion of the acoustic signal, in the time domain, proportional to the source/receiver relative speed [7]. The Doppler effect has a stronger impact on ultrasonic propagation than in electromagnetic wave propagation due to the lower speed of sound. For example, a person traveling at 1m/s produces a maximum Doppler shift [7] of 118Hz on a 40kHz carrier. For FM radio reception to have an equivalent Doppler shift, the person needs to travel at more than 330m/s (1188km/h). The Doppler effect can be simulated by resampling the channel impulse response over time. Therefore, the impulse response will be different for each instant n: (8) h s ( n , m ) = h s ( n ) ( m ) where the h s ( n ) ( m ) is the impulse response h s ( m ) for the instant n for source s. Fig. 14 presents the block diagram of the Doppler effect implementation in the simulator. For each instant n the source and the receiver position must be determined and the IR must be computed using the simulator. After that the IR can be applied to the input signal x ( n ) to obtain the output sample y ( n ) . For instant n + 1 the source and the receiver position must be updated in the simulator and a new IR must computed and applied to x ( n + 1 ) to obtain the output sample y ( n + 1 ) . As a result of this, for each output sample an IR must be computed with the simulator which leads to a extremely high computation time. However, it produces a very accurate result with multiple reflections and it can be applied to any kind of movement and room scenarios. 6 Simulator results The system measurement chain presented in Fig. 15 will be used to perform the practical tests. The distance between the microphone and the speaker could be fixed or variable depending on the type of measurement. An PC with Matlab was used to receive and process the ultrasonic waves and to communicate with the data acquisition hardware, namely the DT9836S-6-2-BNC from Data Translation. The Brüel & Kjær 4954-A microphone was used to receive the ultrasonic signals, it is calibrated, operates up to 100kHz and its manufacture provides a well-known frequency response. The speaker that was used is a Kemo L10 (see Fig. 16 a), which has an excellent frequency response between 15kHz and 45kHz, nevertheless it can produce waves up to 80kHz, as can be seen in Fig. 16b. 6.1 Single reflection To test the simulator behavior a very simple example with a single reflection will be described. The simulator impulse response will be compared with the real impulse response obtained under similar circumstances. Fig. 17 shows the scheme of the measurement setup system used. The microphone and the source were placed at fixed positions at 1.45m from the floor and 5.5m apart. An environment as similar as possible to the real one was created in the simulator. The real impulse response was obtained by correlation. The resultant IR is compared in Fig. 18 with the impulse response obtained by the simulator. One can see that the impulse responses are very similar, proving that the simulator presents a very high degree of similarity to the real environment described in Fig. 17. 6.2 Simulation of a complex room In order to test the simulator in a complex room, the room environment presented in Fig. 19 was used. The room has the following external dimensions 6×10×3m and in the middle of the room there is a 3m long wall. The walls and the ceiling are made of medium-density fiberboard (MDF) and the floor of concrete. The speaker was placed in the inside wall corner, near the ceiling pointing in the direction of the room corner (3, 0, 0) as shown in Fig. 20 . The impulse response was measured in five different places in the room, as presented in Fig. 20, at 1.5m from the floor. A measuring tape was used to set the positions of the microphone. Therefore the microphone position presents errors of the order of a centimeter. The first four points are inside the same room division of the speaker and the last point is out of the speaker’s line-of-sight. Nevertheless, this point can receive reflected waves from walls. The results for this five points are presented in Fig. 21 , where the left column presents the impulse response obtained from the simulator and the right column the real impulse response obtained by correlation. In spite of some differences, especially in the impulses amplitude, it can be said that the impulse response obtained in the simulator matches very well the impulse response obtained in the field. A careful analysis of the results reveals that the main echos of the simulator IR (the ones with a considerable amplitude in comparison to the direct wave) have a similar amplitude and arrive at the same time that the ones in the real IR. The amplitude difference could be related to some reflection coefficient difference over the wall material and the roughness of the concrete floor. Another important issue that the simulator does not take it into account can be observed in the results for P 5, which is the ultrasonic propagation through wall. In P 5 all the impulse response spikes before 25ms are related to ultrasonic waves that cross the inside wall. The distance between the speaker and the microphone is around 2.55m resulting into a 7.5ms time delay therefore the first spike in the real IR arises from the direct path. Nevertheless, these small differences do not compromise the realism of the simulator, on the other hand, they reinforce the idea that the simulator is a very important tool to estimate the ultrasonic signal propagation in a particular room. 6.3 Doppler effect To test the Doppler effect a receiver moving with an uniform and circular movement was used. For that purpose the simulation setup shown in Fig. 22 was used. In this setup there are six surfaces with a reflection coefficient of 0.5 (four walls, floor and ceiling), the floor was placed at z = - 1 m and the ceiling at z = 2 m. The receiver performs a circular movement with constant speed of 10m/s and 2m of radius. Moreover, to evaluate and understand the reflections impact, the receiver makes two complete turns, which takes around 2.51s, in the first turn the simulator considers no reflection and in the second turn the simulator considers a maximum of three successive reflections. The source was placed at 1m from the coordinate system origin in (0; - 1 ; 0) and its direction was set to the y coordinate. The same speaker of the previous tests (Fig. 16a) was used. As a consequence of the source position, the relative speed will change with time according to Fig. 23 which presents a speed variation of ±5m/s. Fig. 24 a presents the Doppler effect on a single sinusoidal signal, Fig. 24b on a signal composed by 5 sinusoidal signals and Fig. 24c on a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulated signal. When multiple reflections are introduced, the resultant signal will be a mixture of different sinusoids with different frequencies due to reflected waves arriving to the receiver with different relative speeds. At 10m/s this mixture can have sinusoids with frequencies shifts in the range of ±840Hz for 29kHz, ±870Hz for 30kHz and ±900Hz for 31kHz due to the Doppler effect. This effect can be seen in Fig. 24a where the signal frequency changes between 29.13kHz and 30.87kHz and Fig. 24b where the signal frequency changes between 28.16kHz and 31.90kHz. Doppler effect was not compared with field tests due to the complexity of the setup, the measuring process and the lack of specific hardware. 7 Conclusion and future work This paper describes the design and implementation of an ultrasonic room simulator with the following characteristics: – designed for wideband ultrasonic signals; – the signal bandwidth can be specified in order to improve its accuracy within that band; – takes into account the air attenuation and losses by providing the desired room ambient conditions, such as, temperature and humidity; – any type of flat surface can be implemented and its reflections can be modeled through an IR; – makes use of the speaker and/or microphone beam patterns; – simulates multiple signal sources at the same time; – simulates the Doppler effect for any type of movement. On the other hand it presents the following limitations: – only computes the reflections up to a certain order, initially specified by the user; – does not take into account gradients of temperature nor wind effects; – discards the wave propagation through the walls (transmitted wave); – only simulates a single receiver at a time; – rounded surfaces are difficult to model; – the simulation of Doppler effect is a time consuming process. The results presented in Section 6 show that the models used in the simulator are valid, very accurate and realist. The implemented simulator is already in a mature state with acceptable performance and good accuracy. However, there are several points that can be improved both in terms of performance and accuracy. In the present version of the simulator the virtual source validation by ray tracing takes more than half of the total simulation time for some configurations and therefore this is a key point to address in order to improve the performance. Another important point is the user interface, which forces the user to know how to use Matlab. Therefore some work could be done in this field making the simulator more user friendly. In the simulator, the room is implemented by setting all the surfaces coordinates, which can make the room definition very time consuming. Consequently, the simulator integration with other simple and intuitive room design software (like SketchUp 3 SketchUp from Trimble is one of the most popular and used 3D modeling tools, it was created to be used not only by professionals but also by amateurs with no knowledge in 3D modeling. 3 ) will simplify the room implementation process. From the accuracy point of view, it will be important to take into account the time and space variation of some of the ambient variables. Another important point in the accuracy field, especially for low US frequencies is the propagation waves through the room surfaces.

Bat assemblages may be negatively affected by wind farms due to the fatality of a significant number of individuals after colliding with the moving turbines or experiencing barotrauma. The implementation of wind farms should follow standard procedures to prevent such negative impacts: avoid, reduce and offset, in what is known as the mitigation hierarchy. According to this approach avoiding impacts is the priority, followed by the minimisation of the identified impacts, and finally, when residual negative impacts still remain, those must be offset or at least compensated. This paper presents a review on conservation measures for bats and presents some guidelines within the compensation scenario, focusing on negative impacts that remain after avoidance and minimisation measures. The conservation strategies presented aim at the improvement of the ecological conditions for the bat assemblage as a whole. While developed under the European context, the proposed measures are potentially applicable elsewhere, taking into consideration the specificity of each region in terms of bat assemblages present, landscape features and policy context regarding nature and biodiversity conservation and management. An analysis of potential opportunities and constraints arising from the implementation of offset/compensation programmes and gaps in the current knowledge is also considered.",

Tel.: +351 234247138. Wind energy is growing worldwide as a source of power generation. Bat assemblages may be negatively affected by wind farms due to the fatality of a significant number of individuals after colliding with the moving turbines or experiencing barotrauma. The implementation of wind farms should follow standard procedures to prevent such negative impacts: avoid, reduce and offset, in what is known as the mitigation hierarchy. According to this approach avoiding impacts is the priority, followed by the minimisation of the identified impacts, and finally, when residual negative impacts still remain, those must be offset or at least compensated. This paper presents a review on conservation measures for bats and presents some guidelines within the compensation scenario, focusing on negative impacts that remain after avoidance and minimisation measures. The conservation strategies presented aim at the improvement of the ecological conditions for the bat assemblage as a whole. While developed under the European context, the proposed measures are potentially applicable elsewhere, taking into consideration the specificity of each region in terms of bat assemblages present, landscape features and policy context regarding nature and biodiversity conservation and management. An analysis of potential opportunities and constraints arising from the implementation of offset/compensation programmes and gaps in the current knowledge is also considered. Keywords Wind farms Impacts Bats Mitigation hierarchy Offsets/compensation measures 1 Introduction In the last 20years, wind energy became the fastest growing source of power generation in the world and it is expected to continue growing in Europe, North America and in the developing markets of China and India. There is also a growing trend in Latin America, new Asian and Eastern European markets and in some African countries (Ledec et al., 2011; WWEA, 2013), though in the past three years, due to the global economic crisis, the rate of growth has slowed down (WWEA, 2013). In Europe, during the last 30years, wind energy has grown from 100MW to over 100,000MW (EWEA, 2012). Among European countries, Germany, Spain, Italy, France, UK and Portugal have shown an extraordinary growth in wind energy in the last decade (WWEA, 2013). In fact, energy produced from renewable sources is a priority in the European Union (EU) agenda, especially after the implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive in 2009 (2009/28/EC) and subsequent amending acts. This directive establishes mandatory targets for 2020, imposing a 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 in all member states. As a consequence, several member states have seriously invested in the development of wind energy, as a crucial way to attain this goal. This goal shift towards a more sustainable production of energy to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases is certainly desirable, but the development of wind energy facilities does not come free of risk of negative impacts on biodiversity (Voigt et al., 2012), as well as noise and visual impacts for local human communities (Leung and Yang, 2012). Among vertebrates, bats are pointed out as one of the most affected groups (Arnett et al., 2011; Barclay et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2003; Rydell et al., 2010). In the last few years, the concern about the negative impact of wind farms on bat assemblages has significantly increased among the scientific community. Since the implementation of the first wind farms in Europe and the USA, it was assumed that bats could be affected by collision with the moving turbines. However, this group only became a research focus when bat fatalities were documented as potentially higher than bird fatalities (Cryan and Barclay, 2009; Rodrigues et al., 2008; Rydell et al., 2010). Bat fatalities result from direct collision or from barotrauma, i.e., experiencing rapid pressure changes that cause severe internal organ damage, especially in the lungs (Baerwald et al., 2008; Grodsky et al., 2011; Rollins et al., 2012). Bat fatality rates show significant variation among sites and years and although there are general recommendations from EUROBATS for the monitoring and estimation of fatalities (e.g. Rodrigues et al., 2008), the lack of standardised methods to estimate these rates hinders comparisons (EUROBATS, 2012). Nonetheless, significant fatality rates have been recorded in both the USA and Europe. In a review of the patterns of bat fatalities at wind energy facilities in North America (USA and Canada), Arnett et al. (2008) present as many as 69.6 bat fatalities per turbine per year. In Europe although a global study has not been done yet, it is known that fatality rates vary largely among sites and high numbers were also reported especially from Hohe Eck wind farm in southern Germany, where rates of 41.1 bat fatalities per turbine per year occurred (Rydell et al., 2010). In the European Union all wind energy developments that are likely to have a significant impact on environment should be subjected to an environmental impact assessment (EIA) (Article 2, Directive 85/337/EEC). That is the formalised procedure that ensures that the likely effects of a new wind farm on the environment are fully understood (Jay et al., 2007) and taken into account before the proposed project is given development consent. For that reason they are a good decision-making tool on project viability (Rajvanshi, 2008; McKenney and Kiesecker, 2010) and should identify and, if possible, quantify impacts on biodiversity, confirm the need for mitigation and set out the mitigation required for the identified impacts (BBOP, 2009a; Marshall, 2001). The negative impacts are mitigated through the implementation of measures that aim at the reduction of those impacts to the point where they have no adverse effects (BBOP, 2012a). Within the EU there are regulations that consider population effects and also regulations focusing on individual specimens of species that are strictly protected. Ultimately, both focus on negative effects that will occur at the population level, though considering that, in threatened species, these effects are more severe, so even a reduced number of fatalities is of great concern. Mitigation involves any process, activity or action designed to avoid, reduce or compensate those significant adverse impacts (Marshall, 2001). The mitigation measures are categorised according to their goals and following the mitigation hierarchy: (a) avoid, (b) reduce/moderate/minimise, (c) offset/compensate (Fig. 1 ) (BBOP, 2012d; Darbi et al., 2009; PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2010). This hierarchy implies that avoidance strategies have priority over remedial solutions (Marshall, 2001) and that those impacts that cannot be avoided or minimised must be addressed through biodiversity offsets or compensatory measures (BBOP, 2009a; PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2010). Strictly following the mitigation hierarchy, it is important to underline that offsets or compensatory measures are the “last resort” and must not provide a justification for proceeding with projects for which the residual impacts on biodiversity are unacceptable. This means that the “no go” option has to be considered seriously and applied in cases where the destruction of unique habitats, or irreversible loss would otherwise occur (BBOP, 2012c; Bishop, 2006). The last step of the mitigation hierarchy, the offset or compensation, has been acquiring importance and popularity among conservationists (McKenney and Kiesecker, 2010; Kiesecker et al., 2010). The clarification between those two concepts has been under discussion in recent years, and Biodiversity Offsets were defined by BBOP as “measurable conservation outcomes resulting from actions designed to compensate significant residual adverse impacts on biodiversity, after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken”. The offset measures should “achieve no net loss and preferably a net gain of biodiversity taking into account species composition, habitat structure, ecosystem function and people's use and cultural values associated with biodiversity” (BBOP, 2013; ten Kate et al., 2011). To demonstrate no net loss or a net gain, conservation action outcomes must demonstrate that biodiversity conserved is sufficient and of the same kind as the biodiversity lost or degraded due to the project's impacts, and that biodiversity persistence is not compromised, or if possible enhanced (BBOP, 2013; ten Kate et al., 2011). For compensation, there is no clear definition set by BBOP, and the edge between these two concepts is mainly related with the capacity of a project to demonstrate that the conservation outcomes are enough to guarantee “no net loss or a net gain” (BBOP, 2013; ten Kate et al., 2011). Offsets are a relatively recent field of investigation (Hayes and Morrison-Saunders, 2007), and the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme has developed and introduced the Standards on Biodiversity Offsets. These standards are based on 10 principles that provide a framework for the design and implementation of biodiversity offsets and to verify its success (BBOP, 2009a): (1) adherence to mitigation hierarchy, (2) limits to what can be offset, (3) landscape context, (4) no net loss, (5) additional conservation outcomes, (6) stakeholder participation, (7) equity, (8) long-term outcomes, (9) transparency and (10) science and traditional knowledge. The compliance with these principles helps to ensure that adequate offset programmes are created and implemented. However, there are several conservation programmes that, for a variety of reasons, are simply unable to follow all these principles, which is more evident in the case of principle 4 — no net loss/a net gain. For some projects it is not possible to prove no net loss because i) pre-impact data is lacking and it is impossible to know what was lost as a result of the project, and/or ii) gains achievable by the conservation actions are not easily quantified. If so, the programme in question should not be considered as an offset but as a compensation programme. Fig. 2 illustrates the continuum from a very basic form of compensation to the type of compensation that is a full offset and may realistically be expected to achieve no net loss or even a net gain. Despite the recommendation to follow the mitigation hierarchy, monitoring programmes in several European wind farms have revealed that, in some situations, significant impact over bat populations may be occurring (EUROBATS, 2013). So, it is essential to guarantee that, for each wind energy facility, the mitigation hierarchy is followed from the beginning and that this sensitive group is taken into account in all steps. In that context, the implementation of the mitigation hierarchy should start during the planning and design phase, in order to avoid any important area, such as breeding, hibernating areas and/or foraging habitats of threatened bat species (EC, 2010). However, identifying potential impacts during the planning phase may be a difficult task, unless it is made in extreme circumstances with easily predictable impacts or in the predictable absence of impacts (e.g. near an important roost or at a hostile, windy and cold site). Furthermore, in some cases the real effects are only indentified during the monitoring of the post-construction phase (e.g. Hein et al., 2013). So, an adaptive management approach should be followed in order to reconsider the mitigation hierarchy during the construction and/or exploration phase based on monitoring results, to continually improve its performance (BBOP, 2009c). For unavoidable impacts, minimisation measures for bat populations usually include on-site efforts to remedy the effects of short-term damage. Research on this subject has been significantly increasing in the last few years, especially on ultrasound emissions as a way to deter bats from approaching wind turbines (Arnett et al., 2013; Horn et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2012; Spanjer, 2006; Szewczak and Arnett, 2006a, b, 2007). Radar emissions also seem to negatively affect bat activity (Nicholls and Racey, 2007, 2009). However, to our knowledge, until now, no device was successfully developed or commercialised. Nevertheless, as bat mortality rates seem to be higher during low wind nights (Amorim et al., 2012; Kerns et al., 2005; Rydell et al., 2010) the most effective mitigation measure seems to be the increase of wind turbine cut-in speed (the velocity at which turbines start producing electricity) and changes in blade feathering (altering the angle of the blade preventing it from rotating on low wind situations). This measure has been proven to reduce bat fatalities from 30% to 90% (Arnett et al., 2008, 2011; Baerwald et al., 2009). If an adverse effect on the assemblage of bats cannot be definitely eliminated or even reduced to acceptable levels through the above-mentioned measures and thus residual adverse effects on biodiversity still remain, offset or compensatory measures should then be considered (BBOP, 2009a; Darbi et al., 2009; PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2010). The acceptable levels of impact referred above may vary between European member states: in some countries the death of any individual bat of a protected species is strictly forbidden, while in others a reduced number of fatalities is tolerated and evaluated on a case by case basis. However, despite that recommendation, to our knowledge and to date, no offset or compensatory measures have been taken in Europe aimed at bat mortality compensation (personal information obtained through inquiries done to the focal points of the EUROBATS Intersessional Working Group on Bats and Wind Farms). It should be underlined, however, that the avoidance of mortality must always be the first option while compensation/offset of the acceptable impacts that remain after the implementation of the mitigation hierarchy should be seen as the last resort. The lack of such measures is probably related to the lack of baseline knowledge on bat populations (e.g. Walters et al., 2012) making it hard to assess the population affected, and especially difficult with migrating species (Voigt et al., 2012). Actual knowledge on bat migration and migratory paths is still scarce (e.g. Popa-Lisseanu and Voigt, 2009). European bat species are classified into three migratory categories according to the distances recorded — long distance (>500km), regional (100–500km), and sedentary (<50km); however, not all populations of known migratory species perform complete migrations and some may even be sedentary along the range of occurrence of the species (Fleming and Eby, 2003). In this paper we reviewed a set of conservation measures that may be applied and assessed in the context of compensation or offsetting the impacts of wind farms on bat populations, in particularly sedentary or non-migrant species. Although these measures were analysed under the European land-use and policy context and considering the ecological requirements of the bat species that show higher mortality rates at European wind farms, the guidelines presented here are surely appropriate elsewhere. This review should be seen as a first approach to the subject, as in some cases the potential of the presented measures is mostly theoretical, and it is crucial to investigate in more detail their efficiency in different populations and regions. 2 Review methodology and scope Using a broad range of monitoring reports and other official documents published between 2003 and 2013 we gathered information on the species, number of fatalities per species and seasonal trends in fatalities in European wind farms. To our knowledge, no publication has addressed specific compensatory measures for bats at European wind farms, so we investigated a wide range of studies describing bat activity patterns, taking into account macro-, meso- and micro-scale habitat features, such as landscape characteristics, habitat, forestry/agricultural regime, vegetation structure, and water and prey availability. Based on the review of i) the ecological requirements of the most affected bat species, ii) the main threats to bat populations, and iii) conservation strategies focused on bat populations, we identified several measures that could be used to compensate wind farm impact on bat assemblages. We focused on forest management actions to be implemented mostly in the surrounding area of the wind farms but distant enough to avoid the attraction of bats into their area of influence, so that by any means, preventing an increase in fatalities numbers. 3 Bat mortality in European wind farms Presently only a few countries have published guidelines for the monitoring of bat fatalities at wind farms in the context of EIA (EUROBATS, 2013). In most countries, this monitoring is mandatory only in some situations and according to the potential impacts of the wind farm in question. Even when monitoring schemes are in place, the results of those surveys are often not available or open to review or public access (Rydell et al., 2010), which makes the evaluation of the patterns of bat fatalities in European wind farms quite difficult. The Intersessional Working Group on Wind Turbines and Bat Populations (EUROBATS) has, however, compiled information on this subject in the European context. Between 2003 and 2012, 5139 dead bats were detected, either located accidentally or during post-construction monitoring studies. The report underlines that these numbers by no means reflect the real extent of bat fatalities at wind farms, even because many infrastructures are not consistently monitored. However, these data probably represent the overall tendency in Europe (EUROBATS, 2013). The majority of the fatalities occurred in Germany, Spain, France and Portugal, but again this may be a consequence of the monitoring schemes being carried out in each country. Between 2003 and 2012, wind turbines in Europe killed at least 27 species, of which the most affected were Pipistrellus pipistrellus (965 fatalities), Nyctalus noctula (704), P. pipistrellus/Pipistrellus pygmaeus (597), Pipistrellus nathusii (593) and Nyctalus leisleri (383). These are all Least Concern (LC) species according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, although the conservation status varies among the European countries. For example, in those four countries, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus are considered least concern species, except in Germany where P. pygmaeus is data deficient; N. noctula is considered rare in Spain, near threatened in France, least concern in Germany and data deficient in Portugal; and P. nathusii is considered near threatened in France and least concern in Germany. These differences in regional or national conservation status of bat species imply that some measures may be priority in some areas but not in others, and that compensatory programmes, even if following the general guidelines presented in this paper and elsewhere (e.g. Boye and Dietz, 2005; Entwistle et al., 2001; Meschede et al., 2001), should be designed according to the regional and temporal context in which they are to be implemented. 4 Ecological requirements of the most affected species Table 1 summarises the ecological requirements of the five bat species most affected by wind energy facilities in Europe. Information about their distribution, preferred foraging habitats, flight paths, and prey items, as well as breeding and hibernation requirements is presented. Those species that are rare or more threatened regionally, such as N. noctula, N. leisleri, and P. nathusii depend on wetlands and mature forests of deciduous trees to forage or roost, indicating that the destruction or degradation of these areas through cutting, replacement by production forests, or forest fires, poses a negative impact for them. 5 Potential offset and compensatory measures In this work we bring together several measures that may be implemented to compensate the residual adverse effects of wind farms on bat populations. These measures are intended for the improvement of ecological conditions towards the increase of the carrying capacity for bat assemblages, specifically for breeding and roosting conditions and the increase of prey availability and accessibility. These actions are mainly thought to be implemented in the surrounding area of wind power infrastructures but far enough to avoid the attraction of bats into the wind farm area of influence. Therefore, measures related with roost and food availability have potentially larger scope and will benefit both sedentary and migratory species; others will mostly benefit sedentary populations that use the vicinity of wind farms all year around. Whenever there is bibliographic support of an increase in bat numbers or bat activity, references are presented. As explained above bat populations are poorly known, and present several sampling constraints. For instance, for migratory bat species it is difficult to understand which populations are being affected and evaluating the effects of the presented measures for those species is an extremely difficult task. Despite the referred, improving bats' ecological requirements in habitats that present limitations will certainly benefit those populations, at least at a local level. So, it is urgent to start studying this topic, as it could be an important tool to mitigate residual impacts of human infrastructures on bat populations. 5.1 Management of autochthonous forests Most native European forests are extremely important for a wide spectrum of bat species, especially ancient forests, as opposed to even-aged and mono-specific plantation forests, due to their higher structural complexity. Bats usually prefer those habitats to forage and roost (Rainho, 2007; Ruczyński et al., 2010; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Russo and Jones, 2003; Waters et al., 1999), though the specific structure of each forest is closely linked to the array of bat species present (Ford et al., 2005). The maintenance and preservation of the existing conditions in mature autochthonous forests and the acceleration of the ecological succession of younger formations are crucial for bat conservation. In mature forests, bats often use large trees and snags as roosts (Crampton and Barclay, 1998; Hutson et al., 2001; Kunz and Lumsden, 2003; Russo et al., 2004). Simple actions, such the preservation of older trees with cavities and well developed branches, and the non-removal of standing or fallen dead trees should be adopted. These actions are mostly relevant for the protection of tree-roosting bat species, and in the context of those more negatively affected by wind farms in Europe, particularly N. noctula and N. leisleri. Still, besides providing roosts for bats, these structures contribute to the enhancement of insect abundance and diversity, increasing the availability of potential prey for bats (Dietz and Pir, 2009; Guldin et al., 2007; Russo and Jones, 2003). However, in some forest types, branch thinning may occasionally be necessary in order to create flight corridors for bats with less manoeuvrable flights (e.g. Guldin et al., 2007; Loeb and O'Keefe, 2006; Obrist et al., 2011), creating vertical heterogeneity and promoting the creation of niches that may be used by different species (Collins and Jones, 2009; Plank et al., 2012). Branch thinning may also contribute towards healthier tree development. Well-developed riparian galleries usually harbour great plant diversity and are frequently used as foraging grounds by many bats, including species most affected by wind turbines in Europe (Table 1). Riparian galleries act as a shield from the wind and are simultaneously home to great diversity and abundance of arthropods (Peng et al., 1992; Russo and Jones, 2003; Warren et al., 2000), thus management actions aiming the preservation or the restoration of those sites are fundamental. In many areas these actions must include the removal of exotic invasive plants, because they override autochthonous vegetation, together with the plantation of native species (Guil and Moreno-Opo, 2007; Marchante et al., 2005). Changes in trophic structures have already been shown for spiders in response to invasive plants (Petillon et al., 2005). Some exotic plants, like Australian acacias, which are among the most significant invaders worldwide (Richardson and Rejmánek, 2011), have an aggressive invasive behaviour forming dense forest stands. These dense stands block the development of native species (Marchante et al., 2005), may change river-flow (Richardson et al., 2007) and fire regimes (Kull et al., 2011), and may also preclude the access of foraging bats to these areas due to high clutter. For the waterline itself, management actions should promote additional heterogeneity of the water flow. The creation of backwater areas that endorse vegetation accumulation favours i) species directly affected by wind farms as P. pipistrellus (Warren et al., 2000), ii) species least affected that hunt in smooth water such as Myotis daubentonii (Warren et al., 2000), and iii) species apparently not affected by wind farms such as Myotis capaccinii, considered vulnerable by IUCN (Biscardi et al., 2007), which may result in an additional positive outcome in a compensatory scheme for a wind farm. Promoting rapid areas that allow water oxygenation favours breeding sites for several species of arthropods, potentially increasing prey availability for bat species (Capinera, 2010; Entwistle et al., 2001). In traditional agro-forestry European ecosystems such as Montados or Dehesas (extensive silvo-pastoral agro-forestry systems consisting of grasslands with a tree cover of holm oak Quercus rotundifolia or cork oak Quercus suber) and extensive olive groves (Olea europaea) in the Mediterranean, and woodland pastures in Central and Northern Europe, management actions should aim at the maintenance of typical extensive farming, promoting the complexity of the vertical structure of the vegetation. Rotational grazing, fruit harvesting, branch thinning and the creation of small clearings generate potential flight corridors for bat species with low manoeuvrable flight as N. leisleri and N. noctula and medium manoeuvrable flight as P. pipistrellus and P. nathusii (Obrist et al., 2011). It will also enable access to food resources located on the ground or in herbaceous vegetation which may benefit gleaning bats, e.g. genus Myotis and Plecotus (Rainho et al., 2010). Additionally, these actions also may represent additional conservation outcomes while contributing to the reduction of vegetative surface fuels, which is especially relevant in Southern Europe, where intensive and highly destructive summer fires are frequent (Guil and Moreno-Opo, 2007). Such actions, designed for bat population management that simultaneously reduce the risk of fire, represent examples of actions meeting BBOP recommendations on how to involve stakeholders in mitigation by showing how they can benefit with actions dedicated to biodiversity management and conservation. Vegetation homogeneity may result in low availability of food resources for some bat species (Dodd et al., 2008). So, it may be necessary to create small clearings or agricultural plots, while avoiding pesticide treatments, in the surroundings of the wind energy facilities, allowing some diversification within the landscape and creating the conditions for greater diversity in food items (Wickramasinghe et al., 2004). This is particularly evident in Southwest Mediterranean where many wind farms are located at hilltops of mountainous areas, and where vast expanses of scrubland are common (Chauchard et al., 2007; Gallego Fernández et al., 2004). In fact, the creation of clearings, and the subsequent development of shoots and young plants, and vegetation heterogeneity may increase both the accessibility (Rainho et al., 2010) and the availability of food items to arthropods that constitute the diet of all European bats. The studies referred above focused mainly on the evaluation of bat activity in different management scenarios. This means that there is still a lack of studies specifically designed to evaluate if those measures have promising results in bat population increase. 5.2 Diversification of forest and agriculture monocultures The diversification of agriculture and forest monocultures is closely associated with the measure described above. In Europe, intensive production forests are characterised by large areas covered with monocultures of the Pinaceae or Eucalyptus spp., regarded as areas of poor quality in terms of food and roost availability for bats (Ciechanowski, 2005; Kusch and Schotte, 2007; Rebelo and Rainho, 2009; Salvo et al., 2009). These areas may also present higher susceptibility to fires than native forests (Moreira et al., 2009) so active management for fire restriction is essential, including the creation of shaded fuelbreak strips where fuel reduction occurs through the cutting and removing of vegetation (Agee et al., 2000; Asociación Columbares, 2009; Guil and Moreno-Opo, 2007) and controlled grazing (Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2011). In specific cases, prescribed burns may also be considered as they promote fuel discontinuity and simultaneously maintain areas of vegetation regeneration, representing a significant decrease in fire occurrence (Montiel and Kraus, 2010); this is a high-risk activity and all precautionary measures should be implemented in conformity with established security and legislation rules. Prescribed burning and thinning have already been proved to benefit bats inhabiting forest pine stands in North America (Loeb and Waldrop, 2008). Because different species of bats use forests in different conditions, the creation of spatial heterogeneity is desirable in those areas and can be attained by the creation of clearings within the forest. This will improve the area as feeding ground and will contribute to the regeneration of autochthonous understory vegetation (Guldin et al., 2007). In areas where this regeneration is difficult, the plantation of autochthonous deciduous trees and shrubs should be considered, in a long-term management perspective. At the same time, particularly dense understory areas may be managed through grazing. It should be underlined that there is no generic habitat for forest-dwelling bats and different habitats will favour different species (Guldin et al., 2007), so the selected measures must consider the species most negatively affected by wind farms in each region. In intensively explored forests, clear cuttings in large areas are common, and this may represent the sudden loss of important foraging and roosting grounds for bats (Borkin et al., 2011; Hutson et al., 2001; Russo et al., 2010). Allowing some stands to grow older may attenuate such impacts, while increasing spatial heterogeneity and the potential development of roosting sites in cavities of bulkier older trees (Russo et al., 2010). The installation of bat-boxes in younger forests should also be taken into consideration (Ciechanowski, 2005) and is specifically relevant for species of the genus Nyctalus that present significant fatality numbers in European wind farms. In areas of intensive agriculture, the planting of live fences and native trees and shrubs provides additional refuge and breeding habitat for many bat species. In systems like Bocage (a habitat typically composed of very small parcels of land separated by hedgerows and ditches found in western Portugal and France), shrubs and trees alternate with agricultural fields promoting greater floristic diversity, which potentially supports greater faunal diversity (Guil and Moreno-Opo, 2007; Haddad et al., 2001; Knops et al., 1999). 5.3 Preservation of existing roosts The occurrence of wildlife populations is limited by the availability of refuge and successful breeding places. As referred above, mature trees are prime roosts for forest bats all year long, and may be especially relevant during the maternity season (Betts, 1998; Carter and Feldhamer, 2005). So, the maintenance of old trees and snags, prime locations while natural shelters for forest bats, must also be provided (e.g. Ruczyński et al., 2010). Roosts used by bats in the vicinity of wind farms, whether of natural or of anthropogenic origin, may be improved or protected to optimise roosting conditions. It is well known that bats that roost in caves, mines and buildings are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic distress (Agosta, 2002; Hutson et al., 2001), and tend to abandon roosts when these are frequently disturbed (Thomas, 1995). Indeed, several important bat roosts are known to have been lost when caves were opened to the public as show caves or used for sporting activities too often (Ransome and Hutson, 1999). Restricting human access to roosts, either underground, crevices or trees may be recommended in some cases. For example, setting adequately designed gates or fences in the entrances of caves and mines may reduce human disturbance of important roosts (Rodrigues, 1996; Tuttle, 1977). Certainly, neglecting this type of maintenance or distress limitation may lead to the loss of local populations (Limpens et al., 2000; Ransome and Hutson, 1999). The preservation of old buildings, bridges and other anthropogenic structures that are often used as roosts not only by Pipistrellus species, but also by species of the genus Nyctalus, among others (e.g. Amorim et al., 2013; BCT, 2012) is also a key issue to bat conservation, and can assume an important role in the wind farm context. Special attention should also be given to building restoration and demolishing, as disturbances made in critical times of maternity and hibernation may cause severe mortality in bat populations (Ransome and Hutson, 1999; Sherwin et al., 2000). Monitoring of any changes is important since access points to roosts used by bats may be blocked, as for example by nesting birds, or even destroyed by minor modifications (e.g. BCT, 2006; Kelleher and Marnell, 2006; Mitchell-Jones, 2004; Waring, 2011). 5.4 Provision of new roosts Native mature forests had been showing a significant decrease in Europe in the last three decades (Gibbs and Greig, 1997; Jung, 2009; Luisi et al., 1993; Oleksyn and Przybyl, 1987; Santos and Martins, 1993; Siwkcki and Ufnalski, 1998; Sonesson and Drobyshev, 2010; Szepesi, 1997; Thomas et al., 2002). As a consequence, many forest-dwelling bats have lost their natural roosting habitats. Even bat species adapted to artificial structures (e.g. walls and stone houses, bridges, fences) had been losing potential roosts, as these structures fell into disuse and were gradually abandoned, presenting risk of collapse, or were entirely destroyed. The creation of new artificial sites, such as bat-boxes built with long-lasting materials (e.g. maritime plywood), is then of crucial importance for European bats, and should be implemented in areas where the availability of natural roosts is low (Flaquer et al., 2006). In fact, Ciechanowski (2005) showed that the occupation of artificial roosts by P. nathusii and Plecotus auritus was significantly higher in pine monocultures than in deciduous forests, because in the latter the availability of natural roosts is much higher. The design and bat box placement-schemes should respect the ecological requirements and preferences of the target-species. For instance, N. leisleri and N. noctula, two of the most affected species by wind farms in Europe, are quite selective in their choice of natural roosts, preferring high-located cavities (ca. 19m above the ground), in more open surroundings, with smaller entrances, that are consistently dry, and at a safe distance from martens (Ruczyński and Bogdanowicz, 2005). While N. noctula seems to prefer cavities with wider inside cross section and with only one entrance, N. leisleri prefers cavities with more than one entrance (Ruczyński and Bogdanowicz, 2005). N. leisleri also seems to prefer roosts with entrances clear from dense vegetation, in areas close to water lines and low tree density (Spada et al., 2008). Although bat boxes have been used for replacement of lost refuges, or even for the purpose of providing new roosts or even as way of facilitating studies about bat ecology, being one of the most adopted conservation measures, few studies have addressed the effectiveness of these structures (Arnett and Hayes, 2000; Brittingham and Williams, 2000; Flaquer et al., 2006; White, 2004). Occupancy rates of bat boxes seem to vary with factors such as geographic location, type of box and sunlight exposure (Mitchell-Jones, 2004). Studies in the United States suggest increasing occupancy rates along the years, which vary with the placement site of the box: trees — 20%, poles — 52%, and buildings — 64% (Kiser and Kiser, 2004). In any case, the occupation of bat boxes by bats may take a while, so they may need monitoring for several years to assess their effectiveness. 5.5 Creation of ponds Bats constitute a group with unique natural history traits, such as the ability to fly and echolocate that make them particularly susceptible to energy and water availability (Adams, 2010; Arlettaz et al., 2001; Barclay, 1994; Barclay and Harder, 2003). In fact, water availability represents a limiting factor to the occurrence and foraging habitat selection by many bats (Adams and Hayes, 2008; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2011, 2013), especially during the summer in drier regions of Europe. However, global climate change will result in increasing average annual temperatures and in a significant decrease in precipitation. So, water-limited environments are expected to increase worldwide (IPCC, 2008). By creating small ponds, water may be available for bats all year long. Ideally, to ensure the sustainability of these ponds in the long term, and to avoid the cost of artificially supplying water, these structures should be placed in areas where rainfall naturally accumulates, and/or take advantage of the proximity of other sources of water such as wells and fountains. Still, in times of severe water scarcity, ponds could be supplied artificially. A few studies provide support for the importance of artificial water sources for bats. For example, heliponds created for fire suppression in North American pine stands were considered important for bats to forage and drink (Vindigni et al., 2009); a similar trend was found for retention-ponds created in agricultural landscapes (Sirami et al., 2013; Stahlschmidt et al., 2012). In addition to providing water for bats and other wildlife, ponds are fundamental systems for the emergence and development of some insect taxa (Cayrou and Céréghino, 2005) that can compose the diet of bats. Allowing and promoting the development of autochthonous vegetation in the margins of the ponds not only provide favourable foraging and shelter habitat for other animal groups (Biggs et al., 1994; Oertli et al., 2002), but also promote the development of diverse insect assemblages, while simultaneously offering bats, and other taxa for that matter, protection against natural predators (Gee et al., 1997). Pond characteristics may determine which bat species are privileged. There is evidence that ponds located in open areas may benefit species with low flight manoeuvrability (e.g. Nyctalus spp. and Eptesicus spp. Ciechanowski, 2002), while those integrated with connectivity elements such as treelines may favour species that follow linear landscape features (e.g. Pipistrellus spp. Downs and Racey, 2006). A comprehensive compilation of pond designs is available from the project Million Ponds (www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/projects/million-ponds/). Hopefully the information gathered during the project, and elsewhere, will increase the scientific knowledge about the most successful designs and benefited species. 6 Selecting suitable conservation measures for wind farm offset/compensation programmes The selection of a specific conservation measure for a given wind farm requires a baseline study. This study should contain information on the most affected species, but also on the ecological, social and economical scenarios of the directly affected areas and of the bordering areas. Only then it will be possible to adequately identify the most suitable measures for the particular residual effect to be compensated. In Table 2 we present, for each conservation measure detailed above, the most suitable areas for implementation, the bat species expected to benefit the most, with special emphasis on those showing higher fatality rates at European wind farms, the expected outcomes, an estimate of how long it may take for a visible offset/compensation effect, and a qualitative estimate on the implementation cost. 7 Bat conservation and wind energy in Europe: opportunities, challenges and constraints Despite the global financial crisis since 2008, the cumulative installed wind power capacity worldwide had, by May 2013, reached 282GW, and is still increasing at a rapid pace (WWEA, 2013). Europe is among the most dynamic markets, with Germany, Spain, Italy, France, UK and Portugal at the top of the installed capacity (WWEA, 2013). This means that the minimisation and compensation of negative impacts on European biodiversity associated with wind power infrastructures is crucial to reconciling the production of clean energy with nature and biodiversity conservation and management, under the light of sustainable development. Either directly associated with the offset or compensation of the direct impacts of wind farm facilities or with the mitigation of other indirect impacts of anthropogenic origin, most of the measures suggested in this paper entail management actions undertaken in private land that may not be, and often are not, owned by wind farm developers. This is surely one of the major constraints in the application of many of the proposed measures: the need for partnerships between private managers, where there is little space for the intervention or facilitation by government authorities with responsibility in the evaluation of the process of environmental impact assessment and of follow-up monitoring programmes. Indeed, more than half of European forests are privately owned (Schmithüsen and Hirsch, 2010), and more than 50% of Europe's land surface is classified as agricultural land (Corine Land Cover, 2013). In this scenario, conflicts of interest may arise between human economic activities and nature and biodiversity conservation in the same land (Breitenmoser, 1998). The establishment of i) local or regional reserves and/or ii) agreements with landowners or managers may be essential to define regimens of sustainable land-uses. The definition and implementation of such regimens must contemplate the effective participation of stakeholders, and should be well sustained by scientific, technical and even traditional knowledge so as to avoid conflicts that may, ultimately, become an additional source of threat for wildlife. In the European Union, the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) and the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) are the two fundamental pillars of nature conservation legislation. These directives use a twin track approach for habitat and species protection and allowed the creation of an EU-wide network of protected areas, known as Natura 2000, that covers about 20% of the European territory. The Habitats Directive, in Article 6(4), sets out the legal mechanism to protect Natura 2000 sites from damaging plans or projects which, in theory, should only proceed if considered to be of overriding public interest, with no available alternatives, guaranteeing effective compensatory measures, and ensuring that the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network is maintained (Dodd, 2007). However, the directive has serious implementation problems; presently, as the network-designation process reaches its conclusion, the challenge lies in achieving effective management in each site (Pullin et al., 2009), because there is still a large gap between the designation of the Natura 2000 sites and the effective implementation of conservation measures in these sites (e.g. Apostolopoulou and Pantis, 2009). Additionally, several important areas for wildlife are still lacking any kind of protection policy/mechanism (Araújo et al., 2007; Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2004; Maiorano et al., 2007; Sánchez-Fernández et al., 2008). Because these areas potentially represent good foraging and roosting spots for bats they should be safeguarded, especially during the critical periods of the life-cycle of bats. Despite their importance, due to small size or spatial discontinuity, many of these areas do not fulfil the necessary requirements to be established as formal protected areas by national or European legislation. Nevertheless they could benefit from the creation of local or regional conservation regimens, established by local governments or non-governmental organisations. When managed properly, public access to these areas may be critically important to gaining public support for the classification of such local and regional conservation sites (Bauer et al., 2009). Moreover, public access together with environmental education and eco-tourism schemes, may promote public perception of and support for the conservation of biodiversity (Blangy and Mehta, 2006; Eagles et al., 2002; Kiss, 2004). Alternatively, or in complement, the establishment of agreements with landowners and/or managers, restricting the timing of potentially disturbing activities may reduce or even completely circumvent bat disturbance during critical periods. Still, some agriculture and forestry activities like cork removal, honey extraction, crop harvest, among others, have temporal specificities, so an agreement between conservation objectives and the requirements of the production system must be pursued. Therefore, other non-ecological factors determining the practical feasibility of successful offsetting should be analysed under social, cultural, technical, legal and financial headings (BBOP, 2012c). In fact, the proposed offset/compensatory measures should take into account the social dimension and attempt to accomplish benefits for local communities and owners, in order to engage stakeholders in the implementation of the offset/compensation actions. Often, the involvement of different individuals, groups and/or associations may be necessary to ensure biodiversity offset fairness; the success of the offset/compensation programmes may also be dependent on reimbursements to indigenous people, local communities and other directly affected stakeholders (BBOP, 2009b). Environmental education and raising awareness of communities and local stakeholders is a key issue in wildlife conservation in areas with human occupation. In fact, successful wildlife management is often dependent on the level of engagement of the people living in or nearby conservation areas. Participative sessions should be promoted for these communities, especially involving land managers, hunters, loggers, either individually or in the form of associations and NGOs. Free workshops on themes such as gardening management, organic farming, and waste disposal are desirable, as these activities are directly related to the creation of suitable conditions for native plants and the associated insect fauna (Asociación Columbares, 2009; Guil and Moreno-Opo, 2007). In the European Union, the potential conflict between human economic activities and biodiversity conservation may also be reduced by the effective implementation of agro-environmental schemes foreseen by the EU rural development policy. These measures are indirect offsets, i.e., agreements with individuals to cede the right to convert land cover for profit (Quintero and Mathur, 2011). More specifically, these schemes foresee payments to farmers who voluntarily subscribe to commitments related to environmental protection Agro-environmental measures are compulsory for the member-states (Council Regulation on Rural Development 1698/2005/EC) but there have been significant cuts in the budget for rural development in many European countries which have to co-fund those agro-environmental schemes — thus creating an additional constraint to the application of many of the proposed measures. The European landscape entails an additional management problem, as a significant percentage of privately owned rural areas are in the form of small-scale household land parcels and farms (Bowler, 1985; Riddell and Rembold, 2000; van Dijk, 2003, 2007). So, even if a farmer and/or manager comply with some kind of environmental scheme aimed at bat conservation, or other component of biodiversity, this does not necessarily mean that the neighbouring land will follow. In some cases, this may result in a very small area dedicated to the implementation of the compensatory measures, which is frequently ineffective in attaining the conservation objectives proposed. According to the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP, 2012b), offsets/compensatory programmes that achieve ‘net gain’ through additional conservation actions could contribute to bat conservation. Additionally, a fraction of the revenues generated by projects with negative impacts may be dedicated to co-fund agro-environmental schemes (Quintero and Mathur, 2011). For example, in Portugal this kind of financing towards conservation is already considered through the creation of offset funds for nature and biodiversity conservation that result not only from the state budget but also from environmental compensation revenues of major private infrastructure projects. Another example comes from the USA where a kind of reclamation fund, paid by the promoters of hydroelectric and oil infrastructures, is in place to be used whenever damages to the environment and biodiversity occur (Cole, 2011). Another important aspect of offset and compensatory programmes is that they should be based on adaptive management incorporating monitoring and evaluations, with the objective of securing outcomes that last at least as long as the project associated impacts and preferably in perpetuity (Principle 8; BBOP, 2012b). Based on that, mandatory programmes on i) bat mortality monitoring at wind farms, ii) the assessment of the offset/compensatory measure implementation and iii) the monitoring of effectiveness and success of the implemented measures, should be the rule in European countries (Baber, 2012; BBOP, 2012b; Quintero and Mathur, 2011I). In fact, even if a continued or periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented compensatory measures is legally foreseen in some European countries – though often only for specific projects and if included in the infrastructure permit conditions – no country seems to be actually implementing this obligation (personal information obtained through inquiries done to the focal points of the EUROBATS Intersessional Working Group on Bats and Wind Farms). This evaluation of the implementation of the offset/compensatory measures, especially those based on the improvement of the ecological conditions for bats, is essential to effectively assess their benefit to bat conservation. 8 Concluding remarks Our review indicates that, in theory, the residual impacts that remain after avoidance and minimisation may potentially be offset or at least compensated through the implementation of conservation measures that improve the ecological conditions for the bat species most affected by wind farms. The majority of the proposed measures focus especially on the enhancement of habitat heterogeneity at local and landscape scales. For instance the maintenance of native forests and the management of production forest should promote an increase in the availability of roosting and feeding grounds, including the improvement of foraging microhabitats. The creation of natural reserves, the establishment of agreements and partnerships with local owners, and the development of environmental education sessions for local communities may also contribute towards the achievement of no net loss and in some cases a net gain for bat populations. To our knowledge, the measures we propose here have not been previously used in offset/compensation programmes for bat populations affected by wind farm facilities, and their efficiency was not thoroughly assessed. This is certainly the next step in this area of research. Additionally, the application of the measures we suggest should be consistently adapted to each wind farm, considering all the local specificities – in particular the local bat assemblage and landscape configuration – ensuring a monitoring scheme capable of detecting undesirable unexpected effects. Based on our review, we found important knowledge gaps in: i) methodologies to accurately assess bat fatalities at wind farms, causes and fatality rates; ii) local and regional specificities concerning the most affected species, and on the ecology of those species; iii) the outcomes of management schemes specifically dedicated to bat populations, that can be used as a basis to develop additional and complementary measures to those here presented. 9 Role of the funding source The work developed in this manuscript is part of the project R&D project, CENTRO-07-0202-FEDER-011541 Wind & Biodiversity, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), under the Regional Operational Programme of Center (Mais Centro).

In this work, using the inter-oligonucleotide distance concept, we develop new methods to evaluate the lack of homogeneity in symmetric word pairs (pairs of reversed complement oligonucleotides), in equivalent composition groups. We apply the developed methods to the human genome and we conclude that a strong similarity exists between the distance distributions of symmetric oligonucleotides. We also conclude that exceptional distance symmetry is present in several equivalent composition groups, that is, there is a strong lack of homogeneity in the group and a strong homogeneity in the included symmetric word pairs. This suggests a stronger parity rule than Chargaff's: in the human genome, symmetric oligonucleotides have equivalent occurrence frequency and, additionally, they present similar distance distributions.",

Our aim was to identify an isolation material with the best quality-price relationship to acoustically coat such a flight room. For this, we built a flight room divided into two compartments that were to be acoustically isolated from one another. Audible and infrasonic waves are difficult to attenuate with low-cost materials but the attenuation of ultrasounds is rather straightforward. We evaluated the absorbing capacities of different low-cost materials - felt fabric, polystyrene, egg boxes, egg boxes coated with felt fabric, absorbing pyramidal foams, polyurethane foams and cork. The material that showed the best quality-price relationship was the polyurethane foam of open cells (5 cm thickness), which was able to attenuate approximately 20 dB at ultrasonic frequencies.",

We propose a genome-wide, alignment-free genomic distance based on compressed maximal exact matches and suggest adding it to the benchmark of commonly used assembly quality metrics. Maximal exact matches are perfect repeats, without gaps or misspellings, which cannot be further extended to either their left- or right-end side without loss of similarity. The genomic distance here proposed is based on the normalized compression distance, an information-theoretic measure of the relative compressibility of two sequences estimated using multiple finite-context models. This measure exposes similarities between the sequences, as well as, the nesting structure underlying the assembly of larger maximal exact matches from smaller ones. We use four human genome assemblies for illustration and discuss the impact of genome sequencing and assembly in the final content of maximal exact matches and the genomic distance here proposed. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",

In particular, the following questions remain open: Is the phenomenon of symmetry statistically significant? If so, what is the word length above which significance is lost? Can deviations in symmetry due to the finite size of the data be identified? This work addresses these questions by studying word symmetries in the human genome, chromosomes and transcriptome. To rule out finite-length effects, the results are compared with those obtained from random control sequences built to satisfy Chargaff's second parity rule. We use several techniques to evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, a novel word symmetry distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. We conclude that word symmetries are statistical significant in the human genome for word lengths up to 6. nucleotides. For longer words, we present evidence that the phenomenon may not be as prevalent as previously thought. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Tel.: +351 234370650. Previous studies have suggested that Chargaff's second rule may hold for relatively long words (above 10nucleotides), but this has not been conclusively shown. In particular, the following questions remain open: Is the phenomenon of symmetry statistically significant? If so, what is the word length above which significance is lost? Can deviations in symmetry due to the finite size of the data be identified? This work addresses these questions by studying word symmetries in the human genome, chromosomes and transcriptome. To rule out finite-length effects, the results are compared with those obtained from random control sequences built to satisfy Chargaff's second parity rule. We use several techniques to evaluate the phenomenon of symmetry, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, a novel word symmetry distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. We conclude that word symmetries are statistical significant in the human genome for word lengths up to 6nucleotides. For longer words, we present evidence that the phenomenon may not be as prevalent as previously thought. Keywords Single strand symmetry Oligonucleotide composition Word symmetry distance Equivalence testing 1 Introduction The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA (Watson and Crick, 1953) made evident that the total percentage of complementary nucleotides (A–T and C–G) in a double-stranded molecule should be equal. This property had been previously reported by Chargaff and it is accordingly known as Chargaff's (1950) first parity rule. The detailed analysis of some bacterial genomes led to the formulation of Chargaff's second parity rule, which asserts that the percentage of complementary nucleotides should also be equal in each of the two strands (Rudner et al., 1968a, 1968b; Karkas et al., 1968). This rule has been extensively confirmed in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, including more recent results (e.g. Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Baisnée et al., 2002; Albrecht-Buehler, 2007; Kong et al., 2009; Zhang and Huang, 2010), that use global association measures and suggest that the symmetry holds for words with up to 10nucleotides (nt). However, the universality of Chargaff's second parity rule has been questioned for organellar DNA and some viral genomes (Mitchell and Bridge, 2006). A natural extension of Chargaff's second parity rule is that, in each DNA strand, the number of occurrences of a given word should match that of its reversed complement. A genomic word, or oligonucleotide, of length k is here interchangeably denoted as a k-mer. Moreover, we refer to the reversed complement as the symmetric word and the pair constituted by both words as a symmetric pair. The symmetry phenomenon that we aim to investigate pertains to the distributions of symmetric pairs, i.e. the distribution of all words and the distribution of the corresponding reversed complements. We focus our study on the complete human genome, on each chromosome and on the transcriptome. As far as we know, previous works do not answer the following question: Are the observed discrepancies between the empirical distributions of the k-mers and their reversed complements, for each k, sufficiently small to infer that they are modeled by the same probability law, and is the phenomenon of the symmetry of DNA sequences statistically significant? Caution is required regarding the application of some traditional statistical tests, which can yield irrelevant or even misleading results, as reported in Baisnée et al. (2002). We adopt a number of independent approaches to detect the word length k above which the single strand symmetry ceases, or partially ceases, to exist. We use a number of standard statistical tools and introduce an adapted version of a multiple equivalence test. We also introduce a word symmetry distance based on Ulam's metric. The contributions in this work lead to the identification in the human genome of the range of word lengths for which symmetry is statistically significant, as well as the threshold beyond which it seems to break. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials We analyze the human genome and use the reference assembly build 37.3 available from the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information discarding all non-sequenced nucleotides (N) from the analysis. All chromosomes and the transcriptome of the human genome were processed as separate sequences. The words were counted with overlapping. We generated 24 random control sequences of the same size as the sequences of corresponding human chromosomes. The model used to generate the random sequences assumes Chargaff's second parity rule: the probability of occurrence of complement nucleotides is equal ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) and the probability of occurrence of each pair of complement nucleotides is estimated as the average of the nucleotides frequency of occurrence in the corresponding human chromosome. The sequences used in this work are denoted as follows: • human chromosomes: H c ; • random control chromosomes: RC c ; • whole assembled human genome: H a ; • whole assembled random control sequences: RC a ; • transcriptome of human genome: RNA. 2.2 Methods For a given word length k, we compare the frequency distribution of all words and the frequency distribution of their reversed complements, in order to evaluate the symmetry phenomenon. We use several methods, including some well-known measures 1. Pearson's correlation coefficient (C), 2. Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL), 3. total variational distance (S 1), which is a normalized L 1 distance (L 1 distance divided by 2) (Dembo and Karlin, 1992). We also use the well-known chi-square test to assess the statistically significance of the exact symmetry (that is, to check whether the probabilities of words and the corresponding reversed complements are equal). Furthermore, we propose two novel methods based on equivalence tests and Ulam's metric, described below. 2.2.1 Equivalence tests Let π 1 , π 2 denote the (population) proportions of one word and its corresponding reversed complement (a symmetric pair). Let p 1, p 2 denote the corresponding sample proportions. Traditional statistical hypothesis testing may be used to assess the differences between two proportions. However, it is well known that when traditional hypothesis tests are applied to large data sets, any small effect is always deemed significant (Moore, 1997; Kline, 2004; Migliorati and Ongaro, 2010). To overcome this drawback, we use equivalence tests for accepting/rejecting the equivalence hypotheses between the proportions of symmetric words. Because the word proportions may have low (or very low) values, particularly for large k, the differences between them may not be a good measure for evaluating discrepancies. Hence, we study the proportion ratio π 1 / π 2 . The statistical hypotheses for the equivalence test are H 0 : π 1 / π 2 ≥ δ or π 1 / π 2 ≤ 1 / δ vs H 1 : 1 / δ < π 1 / π 2 < δ . here δ ( > 1 ) represents a small tolerance used to conclude a practical equivalence between the proportions of symmetric words. For convenience, the hypotheses above are formulated only for one pair of symmetric words, but they represent all pairs of symmetric words. The ratio between two proportions, r = p 1 / p 2 , is an effect size measure. As in many studies, e.g. Thanassoulis and Vasan (2010), we consider the effect to be weak when it assumes values between 1.1 and 1.3 and we explore these lower effect size values as a tolerance to conclude about practical equivalence. The confidence interval for the unknown true value of π 1 / π 2 , considering the ln-method of Katz et al. (1978), for a given α , is ( p 1 p 2 e − z 1 − α / 2 1 / n 1 − 1 / N + 1 / n 2 − 1 / N ; p 1 p 2 e z 1 − α / 2 1 / n 1 − 1 / N + 1 / n 2 − 1 / N ) where n 1 and n 2 are the number of occurrences of the corresponding words and N is the total number of word occurrences. The equivalence tests procedure consists of obtaining the confidence interval for the proportion ratios and checking if it is contained within the interval ( 1 / δ , δ ) . If so, H 0 is rejected and the equivalence can be assumed. For each word length k, we performed 4 k equivalence tests. When all of the 4 k null hypotheses are rejected, we consider that the distributions of symmetric pairs (i.e. the distribution of occurrence of all words and the distribution of occurrence of their corresponding reversed complements) are equivalent. 2.2.2 Word symmetry distance For a given word length k, the distribution of original words is sorted by frequency values and the final arrangement is denoted as A 1 ( k ) . A second arrangement, A 2 ( k ) , is obtained by sorting symmetric pairs according to the largest frequency value of each pair. In this way, symmetric words are kept adjacent and elements of the pair are sorted according to their frequencies. For illustration, consider an arrangement of the dinucleotides A 1 ( 2 ) [ AA AT TT AG CT AC GT CA CG TG GA GC TC CC GG TA ] and the corresponding arrangement A 2 ( 2 ) [ AA TT AT AG CT AC GT CA TG CG GA TC GC CC GG TA ] . Under the assumption of the symmetry phenomenon, A 1 ( k ) should be equal to A 2 ( k ) . Deviations from this ideal symmetry are quantified using Ulam's metric, which is the minimum number of moves required to go from arrangement A 1 to arrangement A 2. This metric, denoted as U ( A 1 ; A 2 ) , is related with the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence (Aldous and Diaconis, 1999). For the example above U ( A 1 ( 2 ) ; A 2 ( 2 ) ) = 3 . As a consequence of the definition of A 2 and for a fixed word length k, the maximum Ulam distance is max { U ( A 1 ( k ) ; A 2 ( k ) ) } = 4 k / 2 . Therefore, we introduce a word symmetry distance given by Ws ( k ) = 2 4 k U ( A 1 ( k ) ; A 2 ( k ) ) , where Ws ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , with values close to zero indicating that the distributions of symmetric pairs are nearly identical, and values close to one reflecting the opposite. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Symmetry hypothesis testing To evaluate the exact symmetry hypothesis for different word lengths (that is, whether the probability of a word equals the probability of its reversed complement) we use the χ 2 goodness of fit test. For random data generated according to the hypothesis, the test should of course reveal non-significant differences. Table 1 presents the p-values of the goodness of fit test of the studied sequences. As expected, the null hypothesis is confirmed for the random sequences, but it is rejected for the human genomic sequences. For the random control sequences (RC c , RC a ), generated with equal A/T and C/G compositions, the exact symmetry phenomenon prevails for the studied word lengths. This is not observed in the human sequences (H c , H a , RNA). Since the random and human sequences have the same length, this cannot be due to the sample size. It is known that for sample sizes like those we use and for a reasonable number of categories, the differences between proportions have a large chance of being detected. The irrelevance of the traditional statistical tests when used to evaluate the symmetry phenomenon was also pointed out in Baisnée et al. (2002). Therefore, we applied statistical tests of equivalence to the data, and tested if the proportion ratios are close to one. Table 2 presents the results of equivalence tests for the proportions ratio for the studied sequences. Tolerances close to δ are often used. We present the percentage of equivalent symmetric pairs for two tolerances: δ = 1.3 and the more strict δ = 1.1 . To interpret the equivalence test results one should take into consideration the value of the tolerance and the size of the studied sequences. In order to check for the presence or importance of a possible finite-size effect, we use the random sequences as control sequences. Obviously, in an infinite random sequence generated as described before, we would expect to observe the symmetry phenomenon (similar frequencies for all symmetric pairs), regardless of the word lengths. If this is not observed in a finite sample, there is reason to suspect sample-size effects. Table 2 shows the results obtained. Consider first δ = 1.3 . The percentage of equivalent word pairs for the human sequence H a is below 100% for word lengths above 8, and below 85% for word length 10. This stands in contrast to what is observed in the random sequence RC a , which, despite having the same length as H a , shows 100% equivalent pairs for all word lengths up to 10. Thus, the decrease observed in H a cannot be due to the sample size. In the case of the shorter random sequences RC c , the table shows a decrease in the percentage of equivalent pairs, starting with length 8. However, the decrease in the case of the human sequences H c is stronger and starts for length 6. Thus, although the effect of the finite sample size cannot be entirely ruled out, the difference between the two cases remains nevertheless clear. The case δ = 1.1 confirms this. Under this tighter tolerance, deviations from 100% equivalent pairs can be noted both in the random data and in the human data. However, the differences between the human and the random cases remain considerable and cannot be entirely explained by the limited sample size. The RNA sequence shows symmetry deviations already for very small word lengths ( k > 3 when δ = 1.1 , and k > 1 when δ = 1.3 ). We observe a much higher percentage of non-equivalent pairs in comparison with the random sequences RC c , which is of a comparable size (RNA has about 134 megabases and the average size of the chromosomes is about 129 megabases). Table 3 presents a summary of the occurrence ratios for symmetric pairs. The table shows the maximum ratio ( max r ), 95th percentile ratio (P 95r ) and 75th percentile ratio (P 75r ) between the proportions of the words in each symmetric pair. For words of length 10nt, a maximum value of 17 was observed. This means that at least one word occurred 17 times more than the corresponding symmetric word. However, in all k-mers the majority of ratios assume low values: the 95th percentile ratio is lower than 1.2 and the 75th percentile ratio is lower than 1.1. In general, for the complete human genome (H a ), and for the corresponding random sequence (RC a ), symmetric pairs have ratio values close to 1. However, for k > 7 , we observe some pairs with high (or very high) ratio values which is in accordance with the equivalence test results. When k > 7 , not all word symmetric pairs can be considered equivalent. We carried out an exploratory analysis of the content of these word pairs. For each pair we searched for the presence of oligonucleotides (with 1–5 symbols). Table 4 shows the four most frequent oligonucleotides (nucleotide to tetranucleotide) present in non-equivalent pairs. For 8-mers, 9-mers and 10-mers we observe that all words in the non-equivalent pairs have a rich C/G content, i.e. all words contain C, G and CG. Moreover, a high percentage of nonequivalent pairs contains CGCG. This evidence is in accordance with the observation first made several decades ago (Josse et al., 1961) of the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) in the human genome, hypothesized to be a consequence of the hypermutability of CpGs due to the increased mutation rate of 5-methylcytosine followed by the inaccurate mismatch repair of deaminated 5-methylcytosine (i.e. uracil) that introduces a thymine upon replication (Bird, 1980). Finally, we note that our listing of non-equivalent pairs may represent words involved in evolutionary processes that may be distinct for different word lengths (Nikolaou and Almirantis, 2005; Bush and Lahn, 2006). 3.2 Pearson's correlation coefficient, Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) and total variational distance Table 5 presents the results of several techniques to evaluate the word symmetry phenomenon. We present Pearson's correlation coefficient values, which suggest a strong word symmetry phenomenon, in line with the previous work in this area (Albrecht-Buehler, 2006; Prabhu, 1993). However, it is well known that this coefficient is not robust to outliers, such as poly-A and poly-T words. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence and total variational distance (S 1) results are in agreement with Pearson's correlation coefficient (C): words and symmetric words distributions are close, at least for words of length up to 10nt. C and 1 − S 1 assume values between zero and one, and values higher than 0.9 correspond to a strong association. Kullback–Leibler divergence assumes values in (0, ∞ ), with greater values corresponding to larger distances. These measures, C, S 1 and KL, may be overstating the symmetry phenomenon, because they only evaluate the global agreement between all corresponding values in both distributions (words vs corresponding symmetric words) and not if this agreement is the strongest among all possible pairs. 3.3 Word symmetry distance In order to measure the strength of the symmetry phenomenon, we introduced a new word symmetry distance, Ws. In the complete human genome (H a ) we observe (see Table 5) that for smaller k-mers ( k < 4 ), the symmetric words permutation is the closest to the original distribution. For larger k-mers ( k ≥ 4 ), there are other nearest permutations. However, for k=4 and k=5, we obtain a small distance, which leads us to conclude that the phenomenon of symmetry is still reasonably strong. For k ≥ 6 the symmetric words permutation is increasingly more distant from the original distribution. To better characterize the fading of the symmetry phenomenon, we estimate the percentage of symmetric word pairs that are spaced at most d words in A 1 (the arrangement of words is sorted by their frequencies). Fig. 1 presents these percentages for d < 50 . Naturally, we observe that the distances between symmetric words increase with the word length. For the random complete genome (RC a ) we observe that word symmetry distances reach higher values than for the human genome, indicating a lower symmetry in random sequences when compared with the corresponding human genome. In Table 5, for 1 < k < 7 and for the complete human genome we obtain a word symmetry distance lower than in the random sequences. For k > 6 the random and human complete genomes present similar word symmetry distances. This result seems to contradict previous ones obtained by the equivalence and the traditional hypothesis test. However, from all these results, we observe that the differences between frequencies of symmetric words in the random sequences are lower than in the human sequences. In the sorted frequency vector the distances between symmetric words in the random sequences are higher than in the human sequences. The random control sequences were generated to model Chargaff's second parity rule ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) thus it is expected that the frequency of occurrence of any word is similar to that of its reversed complement. This similarity is expected for any word length. Since, for word lengths greater than 1 ( k > 1 ) there are groups of words whose expected frequencies are similar (e.g. AAA, AAT, ATA, ATT, TAA, TAT, TTA, TTT), we do not expect null distances between the frequencies of the symmetric word pairs in the vector sorted by the frequency of occurrence. Thus, the results obtained for the word symmetry distance of the random sequences are in agreement with the expected values. In addition, to better characterize the symmetry phenomenon, for each k-mer, we find the maximum distance between two symmetric words ( max d ) in A 1. Note that the maximum distance between two words in a general arrangement is 4 k − 1 . Because of this, we propose a normalized maximum distance max ′ d = max d / ( 4 k − 1 ) . In Table 5 we observe that in the complete human genome (H a ) the normalized maximum distance is small ( < 0.1 ) for k-mers of length 1–9nt, but larger for 10-mers. If we consider a threshold of 0.05, the symmetry phenomenon is relevant for words of length up to 8nt. In the random complete sequence (RC a ) using the normalized maximum distance with 0.05 threshold, the symmetry phenomenon is relevant only for k=1 and takes values similar to the complete human genome only for k=1 or k=10. In order to compare the symmetry results for the random control sequences with the corresponding human chromosomes and RNA sequences, we present some plots in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 we observe that the word symmetry distances in RNA and the random control sequences are very similar. In the human chromosome sequences the average values of the word symmetry for 1 < k < 8 suggest higher symmetry than in random or RNA sequences. Fig. 3 shows two scatter plots to study the size effect in word symmetry distance, for k=7 and k=10. For random sequences, the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient between chromosome size and word symmetry distance is lower than 0.5 for k ≤ 8 and for k > 8 the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient is higher than 0.80. This difference might arise from the finite sample size. These results emphasize the hypothesis that for k > 8 the effect of the sample size begins to be noticeable, as already suggested in the context of equivalence testing. 4 Conclusion We used several criteria to compare distributions of words and their reversed complements, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, total variational distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, a novel word symmetry distance, the normalized maximum distance, as well as traditional and equivalence statistical tests. Our results for relatively short words agree with and reinforce previous evidence in the literature (Albrecht-Buehler, 2006; Baisnée et al., 2002; Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Prabhu, 1993). The several measures used complement each other, providing a broader description of the symmetry phenomenon. In terms of frequency similarity, the symmetry was assessed with the total variational distance, Kullback–Leibler divergence, traditional and equivalence hypothesis tests. In terms of correlation the symmetry was described by Pearson's coefficient. In terms of the distance between symmetric words in sorted frequency vector the symmetry was discussed by the word symmetry distance and the normalized maximum distance. We compared the human sequences with random control sequences ( π A = π T and π C = π G ) of the same length, to understand the onset of finite sample size effects. An infinite random sequence generated subject to π A = π T and π C = π G should exhibit the symmetry phenomenon (similar frequencies for all symmetric pairs), regardless of the word length. A failure to detect this symmetry in a finite sample sequence reveals a limitation in the sample size. The human genome deviates from the symmetry more rapidly than the control sequences. For example, in the complete human genome, the equivalence testing shows that the symmetry phenomenon is statistically significant at least for words of length up to 6nt. As the word length increases, the strength of the symmetry phenomenon in the complete human genome decreases, but does so more rapidly than in the control sequences. In terms of distances between symmetric words, the symmetry remains higher than in the control sequences, at least for 1 < k < 7 . However, for k > 6 , high distance values can be found in both cases (word symmetry distance > 90 % ). The analysis of our results shows that, globally, Chargaff's second parity rule only holds for small oligonucleotides, in the human genome. However, there are some large oligonucleotides for which the extension of Chargaff's second parity holds. We also proposed new methods to evaluate the distance between symmetric words in the sorted frequency vector. The new methods evaluate the word length k s at which symmetry ceases to exist. The results obtained point to similar thresholds ( 5 ≤ k s ≤ 7 ). This suggests that the phenomenon of symmetry is not as strong as previously thought. Furthermore, in the case of RNA, this is especially notorious, even for the smallest word lengths. The deviations from perfect symmetry are more pronounced for large word lengths, for which the sample size limit might become an issue. Therefore, we were careful to subtract this effect from the analysis. We based our conclusions on a set of methods, not on a single one; statistical significance was a major concern; and we systematically used control sequences to detect the onset of problems due to limited sample sizes. We feel that our results provide a broad picture of the symmetry phenomenon in the human genome and the extent to which it holds.

Keywords: wind farm, ultrasound acquisition, thermal camera and bat monitoring system. UltraSoundGate 116 with CM16/CMPA from Avisoft Bioacoustics, the Batcorder 2.0 from ecoObs, the Batlogger from Elekon AG, the D500 and D1000 from Pettersson Elektronik, and the Song Meter SM2BAT from Wildlife Acoustics. The variety of commercially available bat detectors offers a spectrum of features at a range of prices (e.g. weatherproofing, temperature sensors and storage options) [7]. Still, the major limitation of these systems is the inability to send the information to a server, deeming impossible the access to the data when the device is left in remote areas for long periods of time. Moreover, none of these systems allows to access the data in real-time. Our system employs a thermal infrared (TIR) camera for monitoring and detecting the activity of bats. The thermal infrared camera detects the heat emitted from and reflected on the objects in the field of view. No illumination is required and, thus, images can be captured in complete darkness. The distance at which objects can be identified is only limited by the optics chosen and the size of the imaging sensor, significantly extending the range at which one can observe wildlife [8]. Temperature differences can also be detected at relatively long distances (around 60 meters). The main features of our system are (i) a thermal infrared camera to detect the bats, (ii) an ultrasound acquisition system using a standard audio card, (iii) a weather station to monitoring climatic variables and (iv) a communication 3G/4G modem to send all the data to a 1. INTRODUCTION Widespread and extensive documentation of bat mortality at wind energy facilities has prompted concern and subsequent investigations on the magnitude and on the factors causing this mortality. Current knowledge of how and why bats come into contact with the blades of wind turbines is limited by the difficulty to observe how they behave around these structures as they pass through on migratory flights or foraging for insects. [1]. As such it is essential to detect, count and, if possible, identify the bats that fly near wind turbines under a variety of weather conditions. There are several established methods for monitoring flight activity of bats during dark hours, including mist netting, night-vision observations [2-3], videography, visual chemiluminescence tracking, radiotelemetry, and reflective infrared imaging [4­6]. Each of these techniques, although effective for some applications, has limitations for monitoring nocturnal activity of bats, especially near large utility-scale wind turbines. Imaging techniques that require illumination sources such as night-vision, ceilometry and reflective infrared cameras are inadequate because it is difficult to illuminate large areas around the turbine towers. There are some commercial ultrasonic bat detectors systems without nocturnal video, capable of detecting bats, such as the AnaBat SD2 from titley Electronics, the Avisoft 978-3-902823-53-3/2013 © IFAC 110 10.3182/20130925-3-CZ-3023.00024 IFAC PDeS 2013 Velke Karlovice, Czech Republic central database. When a bat is detected by the thermal camera vision system, or by the ultrasound acquisition system, an event is registered in the database as well as a few seconds of the video and audio data. All this information is sent to a central database using the 3G/4G modem. Through the acquired data on weather variables and bat detection events it is possible to model the factors that promote the emergence and patterns of bat activity. Our solution is autonomous, because it uses a solar panel, a charge regulator and a lead acid battery to provide energy to the system. 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE continues to register climatic information. The station includes a rain collector, temperature and humidity sensors, an anemometer, solar radiation and UV sensors. The proposed system is composed of a single web server and one or more bat monitoring systems. Each monitoring system is able to collect different types of data, like climatic variables, audio and/or video data and upload them to the web server through a 3G/4G modem. Video and audio files are only recorded when a bat is detected by the real time ultrasound-detector device and/or the video analysis software system. Therefore, each prototype has a local database that collects all the system events, including charge information from the charge regulator, information from the weather station and also the path to the audio and video recorded files. The local database of each prototype is differentially uploaded to a single database in the web server. For this purpose, an unique ID is given to each prototype. 2.1 Hardware The bat monitoring system (see Figure 1) is composed of several components as shown in Figure 2. The main component is a mini PC. We have chosen the fit-PC2 due to its small size and low power consumption. This computer is able to run the standard Windows XP operating system and it is responsible for all the processing and recording tasks. Windows XP was chosen because it is the common denominator of the software drivers for the different connected peripherals. The system is powered by a polycrystalline solar panel with a maximum power of 80 W and 12 V, a charge regulator (Steca Tarom 245) and a lead acid battery. The data recorded by the charge regulator is also registered on the event database in order to verify the power conditions of the system. The output of the charge regulator is connected to a power supply unit (PSU) that is responsible for the power management between the wireless envoy, the thermal camera, and the fit-PC2. To acquire the weather data we used a station (Wireless Vantage Pro2, from Davis), which wirelessly communicates with the wireless envoy and sends the data to the fit-PC2. The wireless envoy has an internal battery power data logger that is able to continuously register the weather information for a few months. So, even if the power of the monitoring system fails, the weather station Figure 1- Left: prototype of monitoring system; Right: interior of the system. For the audio acquisition we used an audio card Icon Cube Mini (Icon-global) 2-in/2-out with an USB audio interface. This is a very compact audio card, equipped with 2 inputs and 2 audio outputs, offering the highest standards of audio quality from its 24 bit 192 kHz converters. For image acquisition we used the Gobi-384 (Xenics) that is a compact thermal infrared camera fitted with a unique on-board digital signal processor (DSP) for improved real-time image processing. It produces images with 384×288 pixels at 25 Hz in the 16 bit mode. This camera has an 18 mm f/1 lens, which gives a horizontal field of view of 25.5º, with manual focus.

To reduce power consumption all devices were chosen taking into consideration power efficiency. The fit-PC2 in normal operation only consumes 8 W and the thermal camera 3.6 W. The 12 V lead acid battery has been dimensioned with a capacity of 55 Ah to ensure an autonomy of 44 hours (with no power from the solar panel). However, the actual version of the bat monitoring system is working with a lead acid battery with only 14 Ah of capacity. Pilot field tests show that the system can work for 4 hours each night with the battery attaining up to 70% of its maximum capacity even in the cloudiest days. 2.2 Software The software consists of a single application (see Figure 3) that automatically runs after the fit-PC2 startup the windows XP. The application uses the free database SQLite [9] for managing the database. Initiation Create*a*new*data* base*thought*the* web*server*settings No Local*data*base* exists?

This application starts by searching the local database and creates a new one if that is not found. The next step is to configure and download data from the weather station. All new data is then uploaded to the web server to optimize the threading stage and the intelligent power supply unit is reconfigured if it is necessary. The application then enters the threading stage, and runs until one of the following events occurs: · The shutdown time is reached; · The state of charge given by the charge regulator is under 40%; · The humidity inside the prototype is greater than 80%; · The temperature inside the prototype reaches 50ºC (because it is the maximum temperature for the most sensitive component, which in this system is the battery). This and other variables are stored in the web server database. From left to right in Figure 3 the main characteristics of the threads are: · The \"upload data thread\" is responsible to upload all the data collected by the prototype and runs on intervals of 1 minute. It is responsible to perform the differential upload of the data (if it has a 3G/4G connection) from the local database to the central database and it also uploads the video and audio files. If it is needed, this thread can also compresses the video files to the Xvid format. This is the only thread that connects to the web server and it uses the library LIBCURL to do so; · The \"charge regulator thread\" runs every 1 minute and is responsible for collecting data through a serial COM port from the charge regulator such as the battery voltage, the system current consumption and the charge level of the battery; · The \"weather station thread\" runs on intervals of 1 minute and collects and stores the climatic data into the local database. The data is collected from the weather envoy through the Davis Vantage DLL; · The \"video thread\" initializes the thermal camera through using the Xeneth SDK and analyses the video captured using the OpenCV [10] searching for bat movement in real time. If a bat is detected it records a video file (avi) and stores its path on the database; · The \"audio thread\" is very similar to the video thread. It initializes the sound card through RtAudio [11] and analyses the audio searching for bat calls (ultrasounds) in real time. If a bat is detected it records an audio file (wav) and stores its path on the database; · The \"shutdown thread\" is responsible to compare the current time with the shutdown time and terminates when the shutdown time is reached. If the application leaves the thread state it sends a command to terminate all threads and, if necessary, it does a final update of all the data to the web server and an update to the intelligent power supply unit before it turns off the fit-PC2. 112 IFAC PDeS 2013 Velke Karlovice, Czech Republic 3. INTELLIGENT POWER SUPPLY UNIT AND WATCHDOG DESIGN 4. DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING Since the system is intended to work on wind farms, we designed the prototype to be power-independent by using a photovoltaic panel. To save power during the day light period we designed a programmable power supply unit equipped with a MSP430 microcontroller (MSP430G2553, Texas Instruments), two DC/DC converters to provide 5 and 12 V and a regulator to provide 3.3 V for the MSP. The Figure 4 shows a block diagram with the internal organization of the intelligent PSU. The 5 V DC/DC regulator (TSR 1-2450, Traco Power) is used to continuously power the weather envoy and the MSP430 microcontroller. The 12 V DC/DC converter (DCDC-USB 100, Mini-Box) is used to power the fitPC2 and the infrared camera. This converter has a control input that allows the MSP430 to turn it off /on. The MSP is continuously running a program that turns on the 12 V power supply at a given hour and switches off the power according to the pre-determined time set up. The MSP430 is connected to the PC by a USB connection, which the PC uses to send programming commands to the MSP. A simple protocol was implemented to allow the PC to set the on/off times and also to check the actual configuration. The program running on the MSP is very simple and easy to verify and maintain. Since the fit-PC2 has auto-on power we connected the output of the converter to the fit-PC2. With this configuration we faced some troubles when we switch on the fit-PC2 because it is being powered by the USB connection to the MSP430. We solved the problem by changing the USB cable by cutting the 5 V wire. Intelligent PSU Charge Controller 12V The bat monitoring system prototype is able to identify the presence of a bat through calls and/or movement detection, in real time and is able to collect audio and/or video files. 4.1 Audio acquisitions and processing We used the library RtAudio [11] to implement the audio thread. This library has functions to initialize, capture and record audio from the sound card (Icon Cube Mini). The objective is to analyze the audio in real time searching for bats calls (ultrasounds). For this, we implemented analog and digital high pass filters. The analog filter is a 3rd order Sallen-key filter and removes all energy below 20 kHz, allowing us to increase the acquisition gain to somehow compensate the ultrasound attenuation. In addition this filter makes the system more insensitive to low-frequency ambient noises. The digital filter it is applied to the original captured signal from the sound card and it is an 8th order high-pass filter designed to remove all the signal energy below 24 kHz. After passing through these two filters the signal is ready to be analyzed for bat calls. We captured in real time N frames from the sound card and an energy analyses is performed on each buffer of frames. If a buffer has a level of energy above a predefined threshold we assume that it is a bat call because all energy of the filtered signal is within ultrasonic frequencies. However, because other sound sources (including animals) emit ultrasonic frequencies, posterior confirmation and identification will be needed. If this ultrasonic frequency is detected an audio file is recorded using the wav format, with a duration of 5 seconds, a sampling rate of 192 kHz and a resolution of 24 bits (Figure 5). 12V DC-DC Ignition 3,3V Charge Controller USB MSP 430 5V DC-DC + Regulator 5V 5V Figure 4 - Scheme of intelligent PSU. Our system needs to be self-reliant, and therefore we configured a watchdog timer. The watchdog is running on the fit-PC2 and is configured on the BIOS with a time between 0 and 255 seconds. During this time if the watchdog running on the fit-PC2, does not send any command to the BIOS, the fit-PC2 restarts. This is an important feature because we designed the system to be set on the top of tall towers, such as those of wind masts. With the watchdog active, if the software has a crash, the watchdog forces a restart. Figure 5 ­ Spectrogram of a bat call detected. 113 IFAC PDeS 2013 Velke Karlovice, Czech Republic 4.2 Video acquisitions and processing The thermal camera (Gobi-384) is initialized through the manufacturer software Xeneth SDK and the captured video is analyzed using the OpenCV 2.4.4 [10] to search for bat movements in real time. This analysis is made by merging the movement with the temperature in every captured frame (Figure 6). Figure 8 ­ Temperature mask of Figure 6. Now we have a mask with only the potential bat and if this occurs for two consecutive frames, we assume that a bat is detected and a video file with 25 fps is recorded with 5 seconds of duration. Figure 6 ­ Captured frame of a wind turbine (bat detected in center of the green circle). Movement extraction is done by applying a technic of background subtraction known by MoG (Mixture of Gaussians) [12], and available in the OpenCV library. This gives us all the movement detected in the current frame, which includes the possible bat in flight, the turbine(s) and clouds (Figure 7). Figure 9 ­ Result of the logical operator \"and\" between Figure 7 and Figure 8. This algorithm seems to be very effective as the preliminary field tests performed in our university campus showed good detection results with a small number of false positives. The results can be observed on the web site 5. CONCLUSIONS Figure 7 ­ Foreground mask of Figure 6. It is also possible to filter all warm pixels using the original current frame, thus extracting all warm objects, which may include bats, other flying animals, the turbine(s) and some clouds. Then, we remove all groups of pixels that exceed an area of 50 pixels, in order to remove the potential individual bat from the mask. This mask is then dilated and inverted (Figure 8) to merge with the movement mask using the logical operator \"and\" (Figure 9). In this work we present a bat detection system designed to be set up at wind farms. The system is able to detect flying bats by using a thermal camera and an ultrasound detector. An image analysis algorithm allows the system to detect the bats while disregarding the movement of the wind turbine blades, the clouds, or of any other object above a certain size or that does not emit energy within the wavelength of `warm' objects. The system is powered by a solar panel and was designed to automatically recover from software crashes by a watchdog. An intelligent PSU allows the system to be shutdown during the day when there are no bats to monitor. The system is currently installed in our university campus for field tests. Preliminary results indicate that the device is robust and the system is efficient, showing a very reduced number of false positives. 114 IFAC PDeS 2013 Velke Karlovice, Czech Republic ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is part of the R&D project, Wind & Biodiversity, co-financed by the national program of incentives for the Portuguese businesses and industry QREN (in the scope of its R&D incentive program), under the operational program \"Mais Centro\", and with the support of the European Regional Development Fund.

All events are registered simultaneously with climatic variables and sent to a central database using 3G/4G.

We found out that the divergence between the distribution of the distances of a dinucleotide and that of its reversed complement is very small, indicating that these distance distributions are very similar. This is an interesting finding that might give evidence of a stronger parity rule than the one provided by Chargaff's second parity rule. Furthermore, we also compared the distance distribution of each dinucleotide to a reference distribution, that of a random sequence generated with the same dinucleotide abundances, revealing the CG dinucleotide as the one with the highest cumulative relative error for the first 60 distances. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The probability of OFDM pulse detection over white Gaussian noise will be presented as function of the probability of false alarm when a threshold technique is employed at the receiver. Furthermore, the pulse detection probability will be compared with a chirp pulse.",

The frame has two different OFDM pulses modulated with BPSK. The first pulse plays an important role, it is used for time synchronization and to demodulated the unknown data in the second pulse by a differential demodulation scheme. The proposed frame architecture proved to be robust to the multipath in different scenarios. Results have demonstrated that it is possible to keep the bit error rate low in the presence of strong signal echos where other techniques fails, moreover, the simulations show that it would increase the reliability of ultrasonic indoor location systems.",

        "doc_abstract": "A finite-context (Markov) model of order k yields the probability distribution of the next symbol in a sequence of symbols, given the recent past up to depth k. Markov modeling has long been applied to DNA sequences, for example to find gene-coding regions. With the first studies came the discovery that DNA sequences are non-stationary: distinct regions require distinct model orders. Since then, Markov and hidden Markov models have been extensively used to describe the gene structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive study about the potential of Markov models to describe complete genomes is still lacking. We address this gap in this paper. Our approach relies on (i) multiple competing Markov models of different orders (ii) careful programming techniques that allow orders as large as sixteen (iii) adequate inverted repeat handling (iv) probability estimates suited to the wide range of context depths used. To measure how well a model fits the data at a particular position in the sequence we use the negative logarithm of the probability estimate at that position. The measure yields information profiles of the sequence, which are of independent interest. The average over the entire sequence, which amounts to the average number of bits per base needed to describe the sequence, is used as a global performance measure. Our main conclusion is that, from the probabilistic or information theoretic point of view and according to this performance measure, multiple competing Markov models explain entire genomes almost as well or even better than state-of-the-art DNA compression methods, such as XM, which rely on very different statistical models. This is surprising, because Markov models are local (short-range), contrasting with the statistical models underlying other methods, where the extensive data repetitions in DNA sequences is explored, and therefore have a non-local character. © 2011 Pinho et al.",

        "doc_abstract": "DNA may be represented by sequences of four symbols, but it is often useful to convert those symbols into real or complex numbers for further analysis. Several mapping schemes have been used in the past, but most of them seem to be unrelated to any intrinsic characteristic of DNA. The objective of this work was to study a mapping scheme that is directly related to DNA characteristics, and that could be useful in discriminating between different species.Recently, we have proposed a methodology based on the inter-nucleotide distance, which proved to contribute to the discrimination among species. In this paper, we introduce a new distance, the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide, which is the distance of a nucleotide to first occurrence of a different nucleotide. This distance is related to the repetition structure of single nucleotides. Using the information resulting from the concatenation of the distance to the nearest dissimilar and the inter-nucleotide distance, we found that this new distance brings additional discriminative capabilities. This suggests that the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide might contribute with useful information about the evolution of the species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

DNA may be represented by sequences of four symbols, but it is often useful to convert those symbols into real or complex numbers for further analysis. Several mapping schemes have been used in the past, but most of them seem to be unrelated to any intrinsic characteristic of DNA. The objective of this work was to study a mapping scheme that is directly related to DNA characteristics, and that could be useful in discriminating between different species. Recently, we have proposed a methodology based on the inter-nucleotide distance, which proved to contribute to the discrimination among species. In this paper, we introduce a new distance, the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide, which is the distance of a nucleotide to first occurrence of a different nucleotide. This distance is related to the repetition structure of single nucleotides. Using the information resulting from the concatenation of the distance to the nearest dissimilar and the inter-nucleotide distance, we found that this new distance brings additional discriminative capabilities. This suggests that the distance to the nearest dissimilar nucleotide might contribute with useful information about the evolution of the species. Keywords Alignment-free genome comparison Inter-nucleotide distances Nearest dissimilar distances DNA sequences 1 Introduction DNA sequences have been converted to numerical signals using different mappings. A commonly used mapping is to consider binary sequences that describe the position of each symbol (Voss, 1992). The binary representation is certainly one of the earliest and one of the most popular mappings of DNA. However, several other different mappings have been proposed (see for example Silverman and Linsker, 1986; Jeffrey, 1990; Zhang and Zhang, 1994; Buldyrev et al., 1995; Anastassiou, 2001; Cristea, 2003; Ning et al., 2003; Brodzik and Peters, 2005; Liao et al., 2005; Akhtar et al., 2007; Randic, 2008; Nair and Mahalakshmi, 2005; Afreixo et al., 2009). Some of the mappings used in DNA processing do not have a simple numerical interpretation and others do not have biological motivation. Also, some of the representations are not reversible and do not take into account the sequence structure. Currently, there is no ideal mapping to analyze every type of correlation in DNA sequences. In a previous work, we explored the inter-nucleotide (IN) distance, the distance to the first occurrence of the same symbol, to perform a comparative analysis between species (Afreixo et al., 2009). In this work, we present a new DNA numerical profile and a new mapping to explore the correlation structure of DNA: the distance to the nearest dissimilar (ND) nucleotide. This representation converts any DNA sequence into a unique numerical sequence with lower length, where each number represents the distance of a symbol to the next occurrence of a different symbol. We introduced also four sequences, one for each nucleotide, to represent the ND distances. This allows to perform comparative analysis between the behavior of the four nucleotides distance sequences and the global sequence. From the perspective of molecular evolution, DNA sequences may reflect both the results of random mutation and selective evolution. One should subtract the random background from the simple counting result in order to highlight the contribution of selective evolution (Qi et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2010). Therefore, we present an analysis of the relative error to highlight the contribution of selective evolution of the DNA of each species. This residual analysis may be used, for example, to perform multiple organism comparisons. Phylogenetic trees reproduce the evolutionary tree that represents the historical relationships between the species. Recent phylogenetic tree algorithms use nucleotide sequences. Typically, these trees are constructed with multiple sequence alignment (Hodge and Cope, 2000), which is a computationally demanding task. Recently, alignment-free methods have been proposed and present some advantages over multiple sequences alignment methods (see for example Sims et al., 2009; Vinga and Almeida, 2003). The distance that we address in this paper seems to possess discriminating properties that might be helpful in inferring phylogenies. We do believe that this claim is supported by the examples of trees that are provided. However, we also believe that, by itself, this distance measure does not convey all necessary information for building phylogenies. Instead, it should be regarded as potentially useful for working in cooperation and complementing other measures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 DNA sequences In this study, we used the complete DNA sequences of 29 species: 27 were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Populus trichocarpa (California poplar) obtained from the Joint Genome Institute and Xenopus tropicalis (Western clawed frog) from Xenbase The species used in this work are listed in Table 1 . 2.2 Distance to the nearest dissimilar Consider the alphabet A = { A , C , G , T } and let s = ( s k ) k ∈ { 1 , … , N } be a symbolic sequence defined in A . Consider a numerical sequence, w x , that represents the distance to the nearest dissimilar of symbol x ∈ A . As an example, the four ND distance sequences for the short DNA fragment CAAACCGTTTAAGTAACAGGGATATTGGCCC are w A = ( 3 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) , w C = ( 1 , 2 , 1 , 3 ) , w G = ( 1 , 1 , 3 , 2 ) , w T = ( 3 , 1 , 1 , 2 ) . The global sequence of ND distances for this example is w = ( 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 ) . Note that the ND distance of each nucleotide corresponds to the repeat length of that nucleotide. Algorithm 1 Computation of w for sequence s. p ≔ 1 p ′ ≔ 1 while p ′ ≤ N do i ≔ 0 while s p ′ = s p ′ + i do i ≔ i + 1 end while w p ≔ i p ≔ p + 1 p ′ ≔ p ′ + i end while Algorithm 2 Computation of w x with x ∈ A . p ≔ 1 p ′ ≔ 1 while p ′ ≤ N do i ≔ 0 while s p ′ + i = ′ x ′ do i ≔ i + 1 end while if i=0 then p ′ ≔ p ′ + 1 else w p ≔ i p ≔ p + 1 p ′ ≔ p ′ + i end if end while Note that (1) ∑ i = 1 L w i = N , where L is the length of w. Let n i be the number of occurrences of ND distance i, then (2) ∑ i = 1 K n i i = N , where K is the largest ND distance present in the data sequence. The mean distance is (3) ∑ i = 1 L w i L = N L . 2.2.1 Relationship between ND and IN distances In general, the ND distance distribution complements the information that is accumulated in the first IN distance. We recall that the IN distance is the distance to the first occurrence of the same nucleotide. Let n ′ i be the absolute frequency of the ith IN distance, (4) n ′ 1 = ∑ i = 2 K n i ( i − 1 ) + δ = N − L + δ and (5) ∑ i = 2 K ′ n ′ i = ∑ i = 1 K n i − δ = L − δ , where δ = 0 , s 1 ≠ s N , 1 , s 1 = s N , and K ′ is the largest IN distance present in the data sequence. The last equation can be described by the following sentence: the number of IN distances greater than one is equal to the total number of ND distances. As an illustration, the computed values for the previous DNA fragment example are N=31, n ′ 1 = 14 , L=18, δ = 1 . 2.2.2 Comparison with an independent random process In order to calculate some statistical properties of various genomes, we will study the characteristics of the ND distance distribution. Consider p A , p C , p G and p T the occurrence probabilities of nucleotides A, C, G and T, respectively. If the nucleotide sequences were generated by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random process, then each of the distances, W x , would follow a geometric distribution of parameter 1−p x . In fact, the probability distribution of the distance to the nearest dissimilar for symbol x is (6) f x ( k ) = P ( W x = k ) = P ( W = k | x ) = ( 1 − p x ) ( p x ) k − 1 , k = 1 , 2 , … Fig. 1 shows the measured and the reference distributions of the ND distance sequences for the Homo sapiens complete genome. Although the ND distance distribution from DNA shows an exponential behavior, it differs from the reference distribution. This is expected, since the reference distribution was established under the assumption of an i.i.d. random process (with constant nucleotide relative frequencies estimated from the DNA sequence). We performed the chi-square goodness of fit test with the result that the distributions are significantly different (all p values < 10 − 4 ). In order to measure the differences between the observed and the reference distributions we used the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Assuming that the DNA sequence was generated by an independent random process with constant parameters, the corresponding global ND distance sequence distribution is given by (7) f ( k ) = P ( W = k ) = ∑ x ∈ A P ( W = k | x ) P ( x ) = ∑ x ∈ A ( 1 − p x ) ( p x ) k . 2.3 Numerical procedure The histograms of the ND distance sequences were computed for each nucleotide and also for the global sequence. For large genomes and for convenience, the sequences were divided into blocks of 500000 symbols. This procedure does not influence the total nucleotide counts. For eukaryote genomes, the chromosomes were processed separately and the resulting distance histograms were stored separately. All the symbols in the sequence that did not correspond to one of the four nucleotides were removed from the sequences before further processing. We setup to investigate how similar (or different) are the observed and the reference distributions of: • the four nucleotides of Homo sapiens; • the chromosomes of Homo sapiens; • various species. In order to facilitate the visual comparison of the various distance distributions with the theoretical one and to subtract the random background, we used the relative error, as given by (8) r ( k ) = f o ( k ) − f ( k ) f o ( k ) , where f o ( k ) is the observed relative frequency of the distance k and f(k) is the relative frequency of the reference distribution. For the prokaryote species the values of the relative error of the ND distance were truncated to values between −1 and 1. We also used the IN distance relative error used in Afreixo et al. (2009) and we concatenated the first 100 IN distances and the first 20 ND distance relative errors. Only the first 20 ND distances were used, because for larger distances the distributions become sparse. We have found that the limitation to the first 20 distances, which was carried out in all numerical experiments described in this paper, provides an adequate compromise between the information content and the vector length. Note that 792 is the largest ND distance for all the studied species and that the maximum proportion of the ND distances above 20 is 0.13%. 3 Results 3.1 Distances analysis We compared the observed ND distance distributions of all Homo sapiens chromosomes and we obtained very small Kullback–Leibler divergence ( < 0.0008 ). We have also compared, using the Kullback–Leibler divergence, the ND distance distribution of the four nucleotides of the Homo sapiens complete genome. The results of the comparative tests are shown in Table 2 , showing that the ND distance distribution of nucleotide A is closer to that of nucleotide T than to the other two nucleotides, and the ND distance distribution of C is closer to that of nucleotide G than to the other two nucleotides. Notice that the DNA complementary sequence was not used in the computation of the distributions. These identical distance distributions for the nucleotides A/T and C/G are present in all the human chromosomes and also in the genome of all the other species used in this work. This may be explained by the Chargaff's second parity rule and the extension of this rule (see for example Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Albrecht-Buehler, 2006, 2007). We used the relative error, as defined in (8), to compare the ND distance distributions, both for nucleotides and global sequences, with the reference distributions. This corresponds to removing the contribution of the random background to the ND distance distribution (Qi et al., 2004). Fig. 2 shows the relative error for the ND distance for each nucleotide of the Homo sapiens genome and Fig. 3 the relative error for the global ND distance sequence. A relative error close to zero means that the observed frequency is similar to that of the reference distribution. Values close to one imply observed distances much more frequent than in the reference distribution. For the global ND distance (Fig. 3) of the human genome, the first two distances have a lower frequency than the one corresponding to random sequences, whereas the other distances have higher frequencies. The relative frequencies of distances above two are higher than in the reference distribution. The repetition of three or more nucleotides is more frequent in the human genome than in a random sequence. This pervasive existence of repeats is a well known characteristic of the human genome. 3.2 Analysis of multiple organisms The ND distance relative error vectors of each complete genome may be used as a genomic signature that identifies each species, thus allowing the comparison of species (e.g. by building phylogenetic trees). We used the UPGMA programs in the PHYLIP package to build the phylogenetic trees (the similarity matrix was computed using the Euclidean distance). The comparison of the various phylogenetic trees was carried out with TOPD/FMTS software (Puigbo et al., 2007) and using the split distance (a low split distance value is synonymous of a high number of common branches between the two trees). Hierarchical clustering was applied to a matrix composed by the first 20 ND distances for all the species used in this study. Fig. 4 shows the phylogenetic tree for all the species in this study. The phylogenetic tree (obtained with complete linkage) displays a first branching between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, showing most of the mammals together. Moreover, all vertebrates are in the same cluster, the only two non-vertebrates in that cluster are A. mellifera and V. vinifera. Fungi are also grouped together. The bacteria are displayed close together and the archaeota further apart. With the ND distance relative errors we obtained an interesting tree that shows some of the evolutive features. However, we could point several unexpected clusters which may be due to the use of small vectors (20 elements) to characterize the species. In parallel, we have developed methodologies based on the IN distances that can be complemented with information from the ND distances. These two methodologies are complementary: both describe distances between nucleotides, but in two different ways (see Section 2.2.1). Fig. 5 shows the phylogenetic tree constructed with a species vector that corresponds to the concatenation of the IN (removing the first IN distance) and ND relative errors. We compare the results obtained by the IN–ND concatenation method with the IN, ND and random methods in Table 3 . The concatenation method obtains a tree topology similar to the IN method, but the changes introduced produced a better phylogenetic tree, including a higher fungi and archaeota differentiation. The differences between Figs. 4 and 5 may arise from the use of larger vectors in Fig. 5 (119 elements), thus conveying more information than the ND distance vectors (Fig. 4). Moreover, as already mentioned, the ND distance complements the information accumulated in the first IN distance. In order to compare alignment and alignment-free algorithms to construct phylogenetic trees (Sims et al., 2009) used 10 mammals. Fig. 6 shows the phylogenetic tree constructed for the same set of mammals as used by Sims et al. (2009), using the IN–ND concatenation method. The topology of the phylogenetic tree obtained using the IN–ND concatenation method is similar to the phylogenetic trees presented by Sims et al. (2009) for alignment based algorithms (Type I, Type II, Prasad Arjun et al., 2008). Fig. 7 shows the normalized split distance between alignment algorithms and alignment-free algorithms (Sims's methods and our methods). The normalized split distance is the number of splits in one tree, but not present in the other, divided by the total number of splits in the tree. The IN–ND concatenation method shows a small split distance value (similar to those obtained by Sims et al., 2009) which reveals that the IN–ND concatenation contains relevant information about the phylogenetic evolution. 4 Conclusion The ND distance mapping contains information about nucleotide repetition structure in the DNA sequence and characterizes the lengths of the single nucleotide repeats. An interesting feature of the ND distance approach is the strong similarity found for the A/T and C/G nucleotides. This may be explained by the existence of inverted repeats and by the second Chargaff parity rule and its extensions (Qi and Cuticchia, 2001; Albrecht-Buehler, 2006, 2007). Since the ND distance vectors are small (around 20 elements) and the IN distance characterizes the distance between groups of single nucleotide repeats, we concatenated the IN and ND distances in order to obtain a vector that better differentiates species. The results obtained in this work suggest that, for the addressed species, there is a genetic signature, a vector with the concatenation of the relative error of the IN and ND distances, that is a distinguishing characteristic of each species.

We find that the compositional biases observed for the shortest absent words in vertebrates are not uniform throughout different sets of minimal absent words.

Our results show a period-3 oscillation in the protein-coding inter-dinucleotide distance distributions that is absent from the whole-genome distributions. We also compare the distance distribution of each dinucleotide to a reference distribution, that of a random sequence generated with the same dinucleotide abundances, revealing the CG dinucleotide as the one with the highest cumulative relative error for the first 60 distances. Moreover, the distance distribution of each dinucleotide is compared to the distance distribution of all other dinucleotides using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We find that the distance distribution of a dinucleotide and that of its reversed complement are very similar, hence, the divergence between them is very small.

In this paper, we use a data model, previously proposed for encoding protein-coding regions of DNA sequences, to build signatures capable of supporting the construction of meaningful dendograms. The model relies on the three-base periodicity and provides an estimate of the entropy associated with each of the three bases of the codons. We observe that the three entropy values vary among themselves and also from species to species. Moreover, we provide evidence that this makes it possible to associate a three-state entropy vector with each species, and we show that similar species are characterized by similar three-state entropy vectors. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

Although only two bits are sufficient to encode the four DNA bases, efficient lossless compression methods are still needed due to the size of DNA sequences and because standard compression algorithms do not perform well on DNA sequences. As a result, several specific coding methods have been proposed. Most of these methods are based on searching procedures for finding exact or approximate repeats. Low order finite-context models have only been used as secondary, fall back mechanisms. In this paper, we show that finite-context models can also be used as main DNA encoding methods. We propose a coding method based on two finite-context models that compete for the encoding of data, on a block by block basis. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. ©2009 IEEE.",

        "doc_abstract": "Motivation: DNA sequences can be represented by sequences of four symbols, but it is often useful to convert the symbols into real or complex numbers for further analysis. Several mapping schemes have been used in the past, but they seem unrelated to any intrinsic characteristic of DNA. The objective of this work was to find a mapping scheme directly related to DNA characteristics and that would be useful in discriminating between different species. Mathematical models to explore DNA correlation structures may contribute to a better knowledge of the DNA and to find a concise DNA description. Results: We developed a methodology to process DNA sequences based on inter-nucleotide distances. Our main contribution is a method to obtain genomic signatures for complete genomes, based on the inter-nucleotide distances, that are able to discriminate between different species. Using these signatures and hierarchical clustering, it is possible to build phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees lead to genome differentiation and allow the inference of phylogenetic relations. The phylogenetic trees generated in this work display related species close to each other, suggesting that the inter-nucleotide distances are able to capture essential information about the genomes. To create the genomic signature, we construct a vector which describes the inter-nucleotide distance distribution of a complete genome and compare it with the reference distance distribution, which is the distribution of a sequence where the nucleotides are placed randomly and independently. It is the residual or relative error between the data and the reference distribution that is used to compare the DNA sequences of different organisms. © The Author(s) 2009.

This is normally achieved by using a high-pass filter that removes the signal reflected from the vessel wall. Unfortunately, the filter also removes the low frequency Doppler signals arising from slow moving blood. A better signal segmentation method that reduces the loss of signal from slowly moving blood is needed to permit the measurement of lower blood velocities. A signal simulator that generates Doppler signals that include the contributions from blood and vessel wall will be very useful for the development of new Doppler signal segmentation methods. This work presents a new simulator incorporating the contribution of blood and vessel wall movements; the characteristics of the simulator output signal are similar to those found in practice.",

Tel.: +44-1248-382753; fax: +44-1248-361429 A closed-form expression for the Doppler power spectrum due solely to the range of blood velocities passing through a Gaussian sample volume placed anywhere in a vessel under conditions of axisymmetric flow, uniform backscatter and negligible intrinsic spectral broadening has been derived. The formulation presented here allows the independent specification of the sample volume position and width, in the three dimensions, and enables simple estimations of spectral shape for pulsed wave Doppler systems. Simpler expressions were derived for the cases of symmetric sample volume projections onto the vessel cross-section and/or sample volumes centred in the vessel. Closed form expressions were derived for mean frequency and spectral width in the case of a symmetric sample volume projection centred in the vessel. The effects of sample volume size and position on the Doppler spectral width and mean frequency are shown for a range of velocity profiles. Keywords Blood flow Doppler spectrum Doppler ultrasound Gaussian sample volume Pulsed wave Doppler systems Spectral width Simulation 1 Introduction There is a considerable interest in the form of the spectrum of the Doppler signal from ultrasonic blood flow detectors. This stems from the use of spectral broadening induced by flow disturbance in the detection of obstructive lesions in arteries [1], its effect on the accuracy of velocity estimation [2] and the possible use of spectral width together with mean or maximum frequency for angle-tolerant velocity estimation [3,4]. The measured spectrum shape is determined by the spatial variation of blood velocity within the instrument's sample volume (SV) together with the variation of sensitivity within the SV [5], intrinsic spectral broadening resulting from amplitude modulation of the Doppler signal from each scatterer [5], deviations from plane wave conditions [6], non-uniform scatterer distribution [7], the spectral estimator used [8], the temporal variation of velocity together with the temporal resolution of the estimator [9] and the effect of Doppler instrument frequency response, in particular that of the `wall-thump' filter [10]. It should also be noted that the SV within a vessel may be significantly distorted by the passage through the vessel wall and other tissue between transducer and vessel [11–13]. A knowledge of the effect of all these contributory factors may allow for partial correction and an increase in the accuracy of velocity estimation, lesion detection and lesion size quantification. In order to make these corrections simple but accurate, methods of estimating the spectral shape from a knowledge of the time-varying velocity profile, SV and spectral estimator characteristics would be useful in order to develop solutions to the inverse problem. A number of different workers have previously discussed the influence of beam/vessel geometry on the Doppler spectrum. Evans [14] developed a theoretical model to predict the effect of ultrasonic beam width on some frequency processors for rectangular beams centred in vessels with parabolic and plug flow. He later extended his model [15] to non-centred beams. Cobbold et al. [11] used a computational model to calculate the Doppler spectrum for continuous wave (CW) systems using uniform and Gaussian beams, allowing for tissue attenuation and improper alignment of the beam and vessel. Their work was later extended to include intrinsic spectral broadening [16] by using a geometric approach and to derive a closed form expression for the spectrum in the case of a uniform circular beam of equal radius to the vessel centred on the vessel [17] and a centred Gaussian beam [18]. Fish [5] presented a theoretical study of the origins of the Doppler spectrum for CW and pulse wave (PW) relating the spectral shape to SV sensitivity variation in the general case and allowing for non-plane wave conditions. Censor et al. [19] related the Doppler spectrum maximum frequency to transducer geometry in the case of far-field insonation for long strip, rectangular and circular transducers. Aldis and Thompson [20] derived expressions for the Doppler ultrasound spectral power density for CW systems showing that, for axisymmetric flow, these could be reduced to expressions involving single integrals – elliptic integrals for uniform circular beams, and Bessel functions for Gaussian beams. It was the purpose of the work described here to extend the range of beam/flow conditions for which closed-form expressions are available to pulsed-wave systems with Gaussian SVs in axisymmetric flow. 2 Method The following analyses make use of the coordinate system defined in Fig. 1 . The vessel cartesian coordinate system is (x,y,z) and the beam coordinate system (x ′,y ′,z ′). The axes z and z ′ are parallel. The origins of both systems, O ′ and O, are in the plane perpendicular to the vessel which includes the centre of the beam sample volume, O′=(0,y 0,z 0). The angle between the beam and vessel axis is θ. It is convenient, in some places, to make use of axial symmetry and use the cylindrical coordinates r, φ defined in Fig. 1b. Axisymmetric flow, uniform backscatter, negligible intrinsic spectral broadening are assumed. The SV sensitivity variation is that measured in situ. For uniform blood flow moving through a wide (negligible transit time broadening) ultrasound beam, the contribution of each streamline to the Doppler power spectrum is [5, p. 368]: (1) S(ω)=∫δ(ω−ω d (y,z))W(y,z) dy dz, where ω is the angular frequency, δ, the Delta function, ω d(y,z), the Doppler frequency for the streamline and W(y,z), the power from the streamline. Assuming constant backscatter over the vessel the power from a streamline is proportional to the integral of the square of the beam sensitivity, G(x,y,z), along the streamline [5, p. 360] (2) W(y,z)=C∫G2(x,y,z) dx, where C is a constant incorporating blood backscatter and other factors not dependent on the beam sensitivity. Changing Eq. (1) to cylindrical coordinates: (3) S(ω)=∫0 2π ∫0 Rδ(ω−ω d ′(r,φ))W′(r,φ)r dr dφ, where r is the radial coordinate, φ is the angle coordinate, R is the radius of the vessel and ω d ′(r,φ) and W′(r,φ) are ω d(y,z) and W(y,z) in the cylindrical coordinate system. For axisymmetric flow, ω d ′(r,φ) depends only on r and Eq. (3) can be rewritten as (4) S(ω)=∫0 Rδ(ω−ω d ′(r))W sh (r)r dr, where (5) W sh (r)=∫0 2π W′(r,φ) dφ is the power returned by a shell at a distance r from the centre of the vessel. If the velocity profile is a monotonic function of r then the inverse function, r(ω d ′), exists and Eq. (4) can be simplified by changing the integration variable to ω d ′ and making use of the filtering property of the δ function: (6) S(ω)= ∫0 ω0 δ(ω−ω d ′)W sh (r(ω d ′))r(ω d ′) dr(ω d ′) dω d ′ dω d ′ (7) = W sh (r(ω))r(ω) dr dω d ′ ω d ′=ω for 0⩽ω⩽ω 0 and zero otherwise. All the following expressions for S(ω) are for the interval 0⩽ω⩽ω 0 although no explicit mention of this is made in the text. In this study, we present results for the Doppler spectrum from blood flow with monotonic velocity profiles of the form: (8) v(r)=v0 1− rn Rn , which gives rise to a Doppler frequency shift: (9) ω d ′(r)=ω0 1− rn Rn . For these velocity profiles, the inverse function of ω d ′(r) is (10) r(ω d ′)=R 1− ω d ′ ω0 1/n and the derivative of r(ω d ′) with respect to ω d ′ is (11) dr(ω d ′) dω d ′ =− R nω0 1− ω d ′ ω0 (1/n)−1. Thus, from Eqs. (7), (10) and (11), the Doppler power spectrum is (12) S(ω)= R2 n|ω0| 1− ω ω0 (2/n)−1W sh 1− ω ω0 (1/n). In order to compute the Doppler power spectrum for different sample volumes, we only need the power from each flow shell, W sh(r). 2.1 Wide uniform beam For a uniform beam wider than the vessel, the power from each streamline is constant, W′(r,φ)=W, and the Doppler power spectrum is given by (13) S(ω)=2π WR2 n|ω0| 1− ω ω0 (2/n)−1, which is equivalent to expressions derived previously by others [5,18,20]. 2.2 Gaussian sample volume The square of a Gaussian beam sensitivity function in the beam coordinate system is (14) G′2(x′,y′,z′)=exp − x′2 2σx′ 2 − y′2 2σy′ 2 − z′2 2σz′ 2 2, where σ x′,σ y′ and σ z′ are the root mean square (rms) widths of the beam sensitivity along the x′,y′ and z′ axes, respectively. Eq. (14) can be transformed into the vessel coordinate system by the transformations: (15) x′= xcos(θ)−(y−y0)sin(θ), (16) y′= xsin(θ)+(y−y0)cos(θ), (17) z′= z−z0, which gives G2(x,y,z)= exp − (z−z0)2 σz′ 2 − (y−y0)cos(θ)+xsin(θ) 2 σy′ 2 (18) − xcos(θ)−(y−y0)sin(θ) 2 σx′ 2 . Expressing the argument of the exponential as a second-order polynomial in x leads to (19) G2(x,y,z)=exp p2+p1 x+p0 x2 with polynomial coefficients given by (20) p0= − cos 2(θ) σx′ 2 − sin 2(θ) σy′ 2 , (21) p1= 2cos(θ)sin(θ) 1 σx′ 2 − 1 σy′ 2 y−y0 , (22) p2= − z−z0 2 σz′ 2 − cos 2(θ) σy′ 2 + sin 2(θ) σx′ 2 y−y0 2. The power received from each streamline can be evaluated from Eq. (2) using the standard result [21, p. 307]: (23) ∫−∞ ∞ exp −p2 x2±qx dx= π p exp q2 4p2 ,p>0 giving (24) W(y,z)= C π −p0 exp −p1 2 4p0 +p2 ,p0<0, which, after substitution of the p coefficients and some algebraic simplifications is (25) W(y,z)=K exp − (z−z0)2 σz′ 2 − (y−y0)2 σy′ 2 cos 2(θ)+σx′ 2 sin 2(θ) , where K is a constant given by (26) K= C π σx′ σy′ σy′ 2 cos 2(θ)+σx′ 2 sin 2(θ) . Eq. (25) is a two-dimensional Gaussian function which can be re-written, for simplicity, as: (27) W(y,z)=K exp − (z−z0)2 σz 2 − (y−y0)2 σy 2 , (28) σz=σz′, (29) σy= σy′ 2 cos 2(θ)+σx′ 2 sin 2(θ) . Changing now to cylindrical coordinates using the transformations y=rcos(φ), z=rsin(φ) and making use of standard trigonometric identities gives (30) W′(r,φ)=K exp − z0 2 σz 2 − y0 2 σy 2 exp −r2 σz 2+σy 2 2σz 2 σy 2 exp −r2 σz 2−σy 2 2σz 2σy 2 cos(2φ)+2r σy 4z0 2+σz 4y0 2 σz 2σy 2 cos(φ−β) , where β=arctan(z 0 σ y 2/y 0 σ z 2). The power from each flow shell is (31) W sh (r)=∫0 2π W′(r,φ)dφ=K exp − z0 2 σz 2 − y0 2 σy 2 exp −r2 σz 2+σy 2 2σz 2 σy 2 M 2r σy 4z0 2+σz 4y0 2 σz 2σy 2 ,−r2 σz 2−σy 2 2σz 2σy 2 ,β , where M(a,b,β) is given by (32) M(a,b,β)=∫0 2π exp acos(φ−β)+bcos(2φ) dφ=2π I0(a)I0(b)+2∑k=1 ∞I2k(a)Ik(b)cos(2kβ) (see Appendix A for the derivation of this result). The Doppler power spectrum can then be calculated from Eqs. (12) and (31) giving (33) S(ω)= KR2 n|ω0| exp − z0 2 σz 2 − y0 2 σy 2 1− ω ω0 (2/n)−1 exp −R2 σz 2+σy 2 2σz 2 σy 2 1− ω ω0 2/n M 2R σy 4z0 2+σz 4y0 2 σz 2σy 2 1− ω ω0 1/n,−R2 σz 2−σy 2 2σz 2σy 2 1− ω ω0 2/n,β . For the specific case [θ=90o; σ y′,σ z′≪σ x′; z 0=y 0=0] expression (33) for the Doppler power spectrum is the same as those derived previously in Refs. [18,20] for these conditions. (Note that in this work σ x′,σ y′,σ z′ are greater, by a factor of 2 , than the corresponding variables used by the cited authors.) In the general case, the Doppler spectrum can be calculated using Eq. (33), but when the sample volume/vessel arrangement exhibits symmetry, σ y =σ z , or the sample volume is placed at the centre of the vessel, y 0=z 0=0, the expression can be simplified. Moreover, when the sample volume is symmetric and centred in the vessel, analytical expressions for the Doppler spectral width and mean frequency can be derived. 2.3 Symmetric sample volume When σ y =σ z =σ sv, the power from the streamlines, W(y,z), is symmetric in relation to the centre of the sample volume, the second argument of M(a,b,β) in Eq. (33) is zero and the Doppler spectrum is given by (34) S(ω)= 2π KR2 n|ω0| exp − z0 2+y0 2 σ sv 2 1− ω ω0 (2/n)−1 exp − R2 σ sv 2 1− ω ω0 2/n I0 2R z0 2+y0 2 σ sv 2 1− ω ω0 1/n . 2.4 Sample volume centred in the vessel When the sample volume is centred in the vessel (y 0=z 0=0), the first argument of M(a,b,β) in Eq. (33) is zero and the Doppler spectrum is (35) S(ω)= 2π KR2 n|ω0| 1− ω ω0 (2/n)−1 exp −R2 σz 2+σy 2 2σz 2 σy 2 1− ω ω0 2/n I0 −R2 σz 2−σy 2 2σz 2 σy 2 1− ω ω0 2/n . 2.5 Symmetric sample volume centred in the vessel If the sample volume is centred in the vessel (y 0=z 0=0) and the power from each streamline is a Gaussian function symmetric in relation to the centre of the sample volume (σ y =σ z =σ sv), the first and second arguments of function M are zero and Eq. (33) can be significantly simplified because M(0,0,β)=2 π . The expression for the Doppler spectrum can then be re-written as (36) S(ω)= 2πKR2 n|ω0| 1− ω ω0 (2/n)−1 exp − R2 σ sv 2 1− ω ω0 2/n . For this special case with maximum symmetry, we can derive (see Appendix B for details) analytical expressions for the Doppler mean frequency and rms spectral width as functions of the velocity profile and sample volume size. (37) f(n,α)= ω0 2π × 1− γ n/2+1,α2 αn+2 1−e −α2 , α>0, n n+2 , α=0, (38) σ w (n,α)= |ω0| 2π 1−e −α2 γ(n+1,α2)−γ2(n/2+1,α2) αn 1−e −α2 , α>0 n n+2 1 n+1 , α=0 where α=R/σ sv and γ(a,x) is the incomplete gamma function and the mean frequency and rms spectral width are defined in Appendix B. 3 Results and discussion In this section, we show how the dimensions and position of a Gaussian sample volume affect the Doppler mean frequency and spectral width. 3.1 Non-symmetric sample volumes Fig. 2 shows, as an example, the Doppler power spectra normalised to a maximum of unity for a parabolic velocity profile using three Gaussian sample volumes with centres placed at the locations defined in Fig. 3 . The spectra were calculated using Eq. (33). As expected, the spectra widen, and the peak frequency moves to lower frequencies as the SV centre moves from the vessel centre. For the elongated SVs, this peak frequency shift is more sensitive to movement of the SV centre along the z direction than along the y direction. Elongation of the SV leads to an increase in spectral width. Figs. 4 and 5 present the normalised spectral width and normalised Doppler mean frequency for Doppler signals generated by three velocity profiles (n=2,5 and 9) using Gaussian sample volumes of different sizes placed at nine different locations in the vessel. The sample volumes used for computing the data have σ z =0.25R, and σ y is varied from σ z to 5σ z . The normalisation of the plots is performed by dividing the spectral width and mean frequency values by f 0(=ω 0/(2π)), the Doppler frequency shift for the mid-stream velocity. The spectral width increases with SV size and with decreasing n value as the range of velocities involved increases. As expected, σ w/f 0 is more sensitive to the position of the smaller sample volumes than to the larger sample volumes. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the mean frequency generally decreases as the size of the sample volume increases. This decrease is more noticeable for the parabolic velocity profile than for the higher order velocity profiles, because the latter is much flatter than the former. In the positions where y 0=0.5R, the mean frequency is almost constant, even for the parabolic profile case, over the range of sample volume sizes studied, probably as a result of the increased range of velocities due to the larger sample volume compensating for the higher weighting of the slow moving flow shells. 3.2 Sample volumes with some symmetry 3.2.1 Symmetric sample volume Figs. 6 and 7 show the normalised spectral width and normalised mean frequency of three symmetric Gaussian sample volumes as a function of the distance between the centre of the sample volume and the centre of the vessel. In this case, the spectra were calculated using Eq. (34). Neither the spectral width nor the mean frequency depends significantly on the position of the sample volume within the vessel when using large symmetric sample volumes as the vessel can be considered `spanned' by the SV in all the positions considered. For the smaller sample volumes, the mean frequency decreases as the distance between the centre of the vessel, and the centre of the sample volume increases and the velocities within the SV shift to lower values. On the other hand, the spectral width increases with an increase in the range of velocities but only up to a maximum that depends on the velocity profile and the size of the sample volume. After this maximum, the velocity range within the SV decreases as part of the SV moves out of the vessel. 3.2.2 Sample volume centred in the vessel Figs. 8 and 9 show the normalised spectral width and mean frequency of centred Gaussian sample volumes as a function of sample volume size. The spectra were calculated using Eq. (35). The plots show, as expected, an increase in the Doppler spectral width and a decrease in the mean frequency with increasing SV size as a result of an increasing range of velocities passing through the sample volume. The mean frequency and spectral width are largely independent of SV size provided it is sufficiently large to span the vessel. 3.2.3 Symmetric sample volume centred in the vessel Figs. 10 and 11 show the normalised spectral width and the normalised mean frequency for the Doppler spectrum described by Eq. (36). In this case, these quantities can be calculated using Eqs. (37) and (38). As expected, the spectral width decreases with decreasing SV size (increasing α) and decreasing range of velocities within the SV (increasing n). The mean frequency approaches f 0 as the SV decreases in size. When the ultrasonic beam is uniform and infinitely wide, α=0, the normalised rms spectral width reaches its maximum value and the mean frequency its minimum value determined by the average velocity within the vessel. 4 Conclusions Previous investigations into closed-form expressions relating Doppler spectra to ultrasound beam characteristics [18,20] were valid only for very long sample volumes (continuous wave Doppler systems) and assumed that the centre of the sample volume was aligned with the centre of the vessel. We have derived an analytical expression for the Doppler power spectrum due solely to the range of velocities passing through a Gaussian sample volume placed anywhere within axisymmetric flow thereby extending the range of conditions for which closed-form expressions are available. Our formulation allows the specification of the sample volume position and the independent specification of its width, in the three dimensions and should enable simpler estimations of spectral shape for pulsed wave systems. In order to derive the Doppler spectrum, we have computed the power received from each flow shell by integrating the contribution of each streamline at a constant distance from the centre of the vessel. Although our method is valid for steady axisymmetric flow with monotonic (in r) velocity profiles, we have presented only expressions for the Doppler spectrum from blood flow with a simple power law, which is the most common description for physiologic velocity profiles. For sample volume/vessel arrangements with some symmetry (sample volumes centred in the vessel and/or sample volumes symmetric with respect to its centre), several simpler expressions were derived for the Doppler power spectrum. These simpler expressions allow the study of the influence of the position and shape of a Gaussian sample volume on the Doppler power spectrum. The expressions derived ignore the effects of intrinsic spectral broadening, finite spectral estimator resolution and unsteady flow and are limited to Gaussian sample volumes and axisymmetric flow. However, in many situations, the range of blood velocities within the sample volume is the dominant factor in determining spectral shape and width and in these cases it should be possible to express the effect of deviations from a Gaussian shape and the factors tending to broaden the spectrum as perturbations on the spectra derived using the techniques described in this article.

Appendix A Evaluation of M(a,b,β) In order to evaluate the following integral (A.1) M(a,b,β)=∫0 2π exp acos(φ−β)+bcos(2φ) dφ, we note that exp(acos(φ)) can be expressed as a series of modified Bessel functions [22, p. 376]. So, the terms in the integrand of Eq. (A.1) can be written as (A.2) exp(acos(φ−β))=I0(a)+2∑k=1 ∞Ik(a)cos(k(φ−β)), (A.3) exp(bcos(2φ))=I0(b)+2∑n=1 ∞In(b)cos(2nφ). Multiplying term by term and expanding cos(k(φ−β)) we obtain M(a,b,β)= ∫0 2π I0(a)I0(b) dφ+2I0(a) ×∫0 2π ∑n=1 ∞In(b)cos(2nφ) dφ +2I0(b)∫0 2π ∑k=1 ∞Ik(a)cos(k(φ−β)) dφ +4∫0 2π ∑k=1 ∞ Ik(a)cos(kβ)cos(kφ) ×∑n=1 ∞In(b)cos(2nφ) dφ +4∫0 2π ∑k=1 ∞ Ik(a)sin(kβ)sin(kφ) (A.4) ×∑n=1 ∞In(b)cos(2nφ) dφ. The second, third and fifth right-hand side terms of Eq. (A.4) are zero for all k,n, and the fourth term is not zero only for k=2n. Its value is (A.5) 4π∑k=1 ∞I2k(a)Ik(b)cos(2kβ), and the complete integral is (A.6) M(a,b,β)=2π I0(a)I0(b)+2∑k=1 ∞I2k(a)Ik(b)cos(2kβ) . Appendix B Derivation of the mean frequency and RMS width of the Doppler spectrum from a symmetric and centred Gaussian sample volume Several measures may be used to quantify the spectral width of the Doppler spectrum: −3 dB frequency, rms width, etc. In this work, we use the rms width, σ w, defined by (B.1) σ w = 1 2π ∫ ω−ω 2S(ω) dω ∫S(ω) dω , where ω is the mean angular frequency, (B.2) ω= ∫ωS(ω) dω ∫S(ω) dω , and the mean frequency is (B.3) f= ω 2 π . These can be re-written as (B.4) f= 1 2π × Ω 1 Ω 0 , (B.5) σ w = 1 2π ∫ω2S(ω) dω ∫S(ω) dω −ω 2 = 1 2π Ω 2 Ω 0 − Ω 1 Ω 0 2 , where Ωm represents the moment of S(ω) of order m, (B.6) Ωm=∫ωmS(ω) dω. To evaluate the moments for the power spectrum defined by Eq. (36), we make the substitution u=(1−ω/ω 0)1/n and note that the spectrum is only not zero for 0⩽ω⩽ω 0. Thus, (B.7) Ωm=∫0 ω0 ωmS(ω) dω=nK′ω0 m+1∫0 1 1−un mue −(αu)2 du, where K ′ and α are constants defined by (B.8) K′= 2 π KR2 n|ω0| , (B.9) α= R σ sv . The Ωm can be expressed as a sum of integrals of the form, (B.10) Xp(α)=∫0 1up e −(αu)2 du= γ 1+p 2 ,α2 2αp+1 , α>0, 1 p+1 , α=0, where γ(a,x) is the incomplete gamma function defined in Ref. [22, p. 260] as (B.11) γ(a,x)=∫0 xta−1 e −t dt. The first three moments of S(ω) are (B.12) Ω 0= nK′ω0∫0 1ue −(αu)2 du=nK′ω0X1(α), Ω 1= nK′ω0 2∫0 1 1−un ue−(αu)2 du (B.13) = nK′ω0 2 X1(α)−Xn+1(α) , Ω 2= nK′ω0 3∫0 1 1−un 2ue −(αu)2 du (B.14) = nK′ω0 3 X1(α)−2Xn+1(α)+X2n+1(α) . Thus, the mean frequency is (B.15) f(n,α)= ω0 2π × 1− γ n/2+1,α2 αn+2 1−e −α2 , α>0, n n+2 , α=0, and the rms width is from Eq. (B.5): (B.16) σ w (n,α)= |ω0| 2π X1(α)−2Xn+1(α)+X2n+1(α) X1(α) − X1(α)−Xn+1(α) X1(α) 2 = |ω0| 2π X1(α)X2n+1(α)−Xn+1 2(α) X1 2(α) = |ω0| 2 π × 1−e −α2 γ(n+1,α2)−γ2(n/2+1,α2) αn 1−e −α2 , α>0, n n+2 1 n+1 , α=0.

        "doc_abstract": "A new formulation for the Doppler signal generation process in pulsatile flow has been developed enabling easier identification and quantification of the mechanisms involved in spectral broadening and the development of a simple estimation formula for the measured rms spectral width. The accuracy of the estimation formula was tested by comparing it with the spectral widths found by using conventional spectral estimation on simulated Doppler signals from pulsatile flow. The influence of acceleration, sample volume size, and time window duration on the Doppler spectral width was investigated for flow with blunt and parabolic velocity profiles passing through Gaussian-shaped sample volumes. Our results show that, for short duration windows, the spectral width is dominated by window broadening and that acceleration has a small effect on the spectral width. For long duration windows, the effect of acceleration must be taken into account. The size of the sample volume affects the spectral width of the Doppler signal in two ways: by intrinsic broadening and by the range of velocities passing through it. These effects act in opposite directions. The simple spectral width estimation formula was shown to have excellent agreement with widths calculated using the model and indicates the potential for correcting not only for window and non-stationarity broadening but also for intrinsic broadening. © 1999 IEEE.",
