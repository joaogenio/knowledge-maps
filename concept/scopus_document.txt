                  'Telecommunications degree. This is a 5-year degree, that '
                  'corresponds to a 1st and 2nd cycle degrees in the Bologna '
                  'qualification framework. One of the touchstones in the '
                  'review process was the introduction of a project-related '
                  'track across all 5 years of the degree. In this way, '
                  'students would be permanently exposed to project-based unit '
                  'courses throughout their degree. We describe the approach '
                  'followed in this reorganization. The project-based track is '
                  'progressive and tries to focus on different aspects of what '
                  'is required for developing a project, from the first year, '
                  'when students are exposed to two small projects (one per '
                  'semester) to the fifth year, where the study plan includes '
                  'the Dissertation, Project or Internship, corresponding to '
                  "the traditional approach in master's degrees. This course "
                  'structure has been welcomed by both the students and the '
                  'companies employing the degree graduates. There is not yet '
                  'an evidence-based assessment of the full study plan, but '
                  'some results exist for the individual course units. The '
                  "informal feedback collected, both from students' "
                  'representatives and from companies, are of general approval '
                  'of the changes that have been introduced.',
